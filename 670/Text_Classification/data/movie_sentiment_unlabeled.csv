"The Last Airbender There are few films that I advocate destroying, but sadly this is one of them. Why you ask? Well...I fear that aliens might one day accidentally pick up the film's signal while some poor soul is streaming it into their home. Wielding a rare power to create water out of thin air, a power much needed by earth as it's rising population has made water a precious resource, they would end up seeing The Last Airbender and assume that it is representative of the Earth as a whole. Rather than being afraid of Earth's inhabitants, I fear they would be bored to tears by the story and in the end come to the decision that Earth is not worth saving. So yeah...I have pretty good reason to want this film obliterated from the face of the planet."
"The Last Airbender Decent visuals do little to save this heavily butchered live-action rendition of the first season of Nickelodeon's ""Avatar: The Last Airbender"". Failing to capture the delightful humor and lovely character interactions of the show, M. Night Shyamalan's first tackle at a fantasy epic is hilariously amateurish at best (If you thought he was bad trying to be Rod Serling, then watch him attempt to be George Lucas). Not only is the plot incomprehensible to anybody who hasn't watched the show, but this piece of cinematic trash is filled to the brim with wooden acting (Dev Patel, Shaun Toub, and Aasif Mandvi are the only actors that emerge with any credibility), awkwardly stilted exposition-filled dialogue, thin characterization, and ineptly choreographed action sequences. The plot will have newcomers confused and the strange alterations from it's wonderful source material will anger established fans. My advice: stick to the TV show and forget about this heap of uninspired tripe."
The Last Airbender But I couldn't. The Last Airbender is one of the worst movies i'v ever seen in my entire life! The plot is difficult to comprehend and the explosion of CGI makes it look so good that it looks bad. The Last Airbender ruined the series' reputation. This is a very bad movie. Terrible.
"The Last Airbender Poorly acted, cardboard dialogue, lethargic, humorless, few of the words that describe this could-have-been fantasy epic. I thought I'd go for the awesome martial arts and special effects but turns out, even that was poorly adapted. This movie is one of the worst I've ever seen.  It's all quite depressing, considering the awesome source material M.Night had to work with."
"The Last Airbender This is an awesome film for both children and adults. Its the first time in a long time when I said to myself I can't wait to see the sequel. Some reviews are disappointed because it doesn't follow the animated version, that I know nothing about as I don't watch animated films very often and usually by mistake, So maybe that's why I judge this film for what it is and what its not like or could be. Many others have told you the details of what the film is about. What I'm telling you is this is a must watch film.. 5 Stars"
The Last Airbender We loved it. We had no knowledge of the history behind the film so maybe that's why we liked it so much. It's a family favorite of ours and I hope they make more.
