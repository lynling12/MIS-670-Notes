"Oct 12 2009 	Nice trendy hotel location not too bad.	I stayed in this hotel for one night. As this is a fairly new place some of the taxi drivers did not know where it was and/or did not want to drive there. Once I have eventually arrived at the hotel, I was very pleasantly surprised with the decor of the lobby/ground floor area. It was very stylish and modern. I found the reception's staff geeting me with 'Aloha' a bit out of place, but I guess they are briefed to say that to keep up the coroporate image.As I have a Starwood Preferred Guest member, I was given a small gift upon-check in. It was only a couple of fridge magnets in a gift box, but nevertheless a nice gesture.My room was nice and roomy, there are tea and coffee facilities in each room and you get two complimentary bottles of water plus some toiletries by 'bliss'.The location is not great. It is at the last metro stop and you then need to take a taxi, but if you are not planning on going to see the historic sites in Beijing, then you will be ok.I chose to have some breakfast in the hotel, which was really tasty and there was a good selection of dishes. There are a couple of computers to use in the communal area, as well as a pool table. There is also a small swimming pool and a gym area.I would definitely stay in this hotel again, but only if I did not plan to travel to central Beijing, as it can take a long time. The location is ok if you plan to do a lot of shopping, as there is a big shopping centre just few minutes away from the hotel and there are plenty of eating options around, including restaurants that serve a dog meat! Sep 25 2009 	Great Budget Hotel!	Stayed two nights at Aloft on the most recent trip to China. The hotel was very modern and clean. The room was spotless and a comfortable king sized bed (as far as soft beds go in China). The staff was very punctual and went out of the way to help my every need, including going to a store across the street to purchase a China Mobile SIM card for me. The buffet breakfast was okay, nothing to write home about. The 42” LCD screen had movies on demand for 20RMB and had a good selection of western channels including HBO, CNN, BBC, Star World etc… The gym was small, had a selection of basic weights and one cable machine, there was however 6 new TechnoGym cardio machines with built in LCD TVs which were very good. The location is a bit out of the way to the central areas of Beijing, but it is better suited for my needs as I need to be in the Haidian district. Being SPG Platinum there were no upgrades to a better room, because Aloft has a policy of not doing any upgrades. The Sheraton next door is a much nicer hotel in my opinion (where I am writing this from now, with an upgraded room) but as far as bang for the buck, Aloft is a great place! Aug 4 2009 	Excellent value - location not a big problem.	We stayed at the Aloft Beijing Haidian for 5 nights from July 17 - 22nd. There are lots of reviews that talk about the location being a problem but we knew this ahead of time and found that it really wasn't an issue. The longest we spent in a taxi was about 30 minutes. We never paid more than 50rmb for a taxi ride (which is about $8 Cdn) and that was to the Forbidden City. Given there are 4 in our family, it was no big deal at all.As for the rooms, they were clean, the beds comfortable, the wireless internet connection reliable and it was one of the few hotels we found in Beijing that would accomodate 2 adults and 2 children. We paid about $70 Cdn. per night. That's an amazing price.It's not meant to be a 5 star hotel so you can't go in expecting that. We found the reception staff generally very helpful and friendly. They aren't the fastest in the world but it wasn't unreasonable at all.The hotel manager made an effort to speak with us a few times and was extremely helpful and welcoming. Their breakfast buffet was quite good and reasonably priced. There are a number of good restaurants in the Four Points Sheraton next door so there were lots of options. There is a massive mall about a block away that has other dining options as well.The only issue we ran into was a few taxi drivers refusing to take us to the Summer Palace because I guess they felt it wasn't far enough. The minimum rate is 10rmb. But the staff at the Four Points Sheraton (which is on a busier road than the side street for Aloft) were quite helpful in finding taxis for us if they weren't already there.We would definitely stay there again and recommend it to our friends for its excellent value. Jul 17 2009 	Stylish clean reasonable value poor location	I am glad to be the first person to post photos of this hotel. Key points about this property:- its a starwood property, much cheaper than the rest, and it shows in the pretty incompetent reception staff, the hard bed, the cheap blinds that don't quite block out the sun in the mornings, and common areas which seem to be degrading very quickly (given how new this hotel is).- on the up side, it is very clean and tidy, and if that is important to you, this hotel presents good value. It is also quite stylishly designed and looks much more modern than anything else in this price range.- location is poor for the typical tourist. Yes, very poor. It is not really close to much cheaper the summer palace, and other places will require a taxi, which will probably result in hours of being frustratingly stuck in traffic. Taxi drivers also dont know where it is. If coming from the East, (i.e. city centre or airport) then it is the right turn AFTER the Four Points hotel, which is adjacent. If you are trying to scam an SPG platinum status in the cheapest way possible, perhaps stay in these two adjacent SPG hotels for 25 nights and check out every night.On the whole I thought it was decent value, but dollar for dollar, I would personally prefer to pay double for the Westin in Chaoyang or Financial Street. I have stayed at both at approx. double the price, for real 5 star service. But if thats not in your budget and you want the assurance of an international hotel chain, this hotel is perfect for you.Lastly, this hotel may also be appropriate for university students in Haidian, but don't pick this unless you know what you are doing. Taxis to BLCU or Tsing Hua may be exceptionally frustrating because of constant traffic around Zhong guan cun street. Tell taxi drivers to go on the four ring road, even though it might be a bit more expensive.There is free internet, but it does not seem to work with iPhones. May 30 2009 	Remote but excellent value for money	Stayed there for one night. The hotel is located in Haidian, which is a little bit remote. But if you don't mind taking the taxi to the closest subway station, which costs only 15-20 CNY a ride the hotel represents excellent value for money given its low prices and the modern, quiet and very clean rooms. Also internet use is for free. Especially for travellors who don't want to spend the money for a Hyatt or Hilton but who look for a very decent place to stay this hotel represents an excellent choice. Dec 31 2008 	Good value but not downtown	This hotel is located next to the Four Points Hotel and are both part of the Starwood group. For those wanting a downtown location, this property may not be for you - I recommend factoring in taxi fares in and out of town when working out the value here. On the otherside, the rates for the hotel are very good and the rooms are basic but well appointed. TV was more focused on local channels which may be an indication of the clients they are targeting. There was however the standard HBO, BBC, etc. Staff were very friendly and check in and check out times were acceptable. Jul 20 2009 	???????????????????"
"VERY NICE HOTEL	We get vacation every year after my wedding. But up to now more than four years we work hard and prepare for great vacation for 4 months we choose Asia is our destination First stop in Beijing we stayed in this hotel.Hotel not too big but the room was nice and comfortable. We liked this and enjoyed it. Nov 19 2009 	A fantastic hotel	My boyfriend and I stayed in the Autumn Garden hotel at the end of our trans-siberian railway trip from Moscow and staying there was one of the highlights of an amazing holiday. Staying in the hutong was so much better than an international style hotel, we really felt that we experienced a 'real' bit of Beijing. We loved the choice of english or chinese breakfasts, the room was gorgeous and having free internet was incredibly useful. The location was wonderful too, only 10 minutes walk to Tiananmen square. Sep 11 2009 	nice place to stay	The staff are extremely helpful and friendly, enabling you to find your bearings by providing a trishaw facility to the main road from the hotel. The location of the hotel is a 5 minute walk from Qianmen subway and the furnishings of the hotel rich in tradition. You may not get the western breakfasts you do in more modern hotels but it gives you an opportunity to live like the locals. Dec 14 2008 	Reccomended	This is a great little hotel, I booked this hotel based on previous reviews, so I thought I would come on here and recommend it myself.I went to Beijing on my own for 4 nights to see what its like. It is quite a crazy place, Chinese people seem to take advantage of tourists at every possible opportunity.The Autumn Garden Hotel however is amazing, such nice people, and I consider it a great price for what I got. Its location is great if you want to get a slight feel of what its like living in China.You need to walk down a couple of narrow alley ways to get to the Hotel, but it is very close to Tienanmen Square, with a lot of sites close by, such as the Temple of Heaven and Forbidden City within walking distance. Also there is a touring company with nice and cheap tours (although in Chinese) which is less than 10 minutes walk away next to Tienanmen Square.The rooms are clean and comfortable. Breakfast is simple but decent. The People are fantastic, talk English and are very very helpful. They picked me up from the airport without any charge, Im not sure if this is a regular service, but it was helpful. If it is your first time in China, I recommend getting picked up, as taxi drivers talk very little English if any at all, and the Hotel can be hard to find, Taxi drivers wont know it.The hotel welcomes you very nicely, and give you a map to the area and to the hotel, and even a mobile phone to use while you stay with them.The hotel had everything you should need, but I was truly impressed by the service there which easily allows me to recommend it. In contrast to most of the Chinese which I met who seemed to try and take me for every cent that I had, this little hotel was there for me for every need, without trying to charge me for the help that they offered, or even the things which I expected to pay for such as the half a day late checkout, or airport pick up.If you want a simple, relaxing, and friendly stay, try the Autumn Garden. I will no doubt be staying there again on my next visit. Nov 10 2008	an oasis in Beijing	Just got back from Beijing and a wonderful experience staying in the middle of a hutong (maze of alleyways) in Beijing, just next door to Tian'anmen Square. This inn is truly an oasis in a crazy busy city and right in the middle of what feels like 50 years ago - staff were so welcoming and accomodating - if you want a taxi, they have one - we went to the Great Wall with our very own driver - even had a (very simple) lunch prepared by one of the staff - who were all delightful - lovely courtyard - very quiet even though in the midst of chaos - a real feel for old China - haven't downloaded our photos yet, but willing to share if anyone is interested! Nov 1 2008 	Lovely traditional style hotel	This is a really lovely traditional style hotel, located literally just 5 minutes walk away from Tianmen square as well as lots of eating options &amp; shops. The girls at the front desk were very friendly, helpful and spoke good english. The rooms are very pretty and comfortable, with modern western style bathrooms. Since it's located in the hutong (lots of narrow, confusing alley ways) It's a good idea to take with you the address of the hotel writen in Chinese characters as well as the phone number, so the taxi driver can call for directions. We were given a mobile to use during our stay - and took it with us when we went off to North Korea for a week and then called when we got back, and they sent out a car to pick us up from the station. On our return we also got upgraded to a bigger room. The bathrooms were pretty much the same in both rooms - the sinks make a brilliant nose when you tap them. I booked, as I usually do, on www.venere.com - this is an excellent website and no down payment required. Aug 25 2008 	Living it the Beijing way	As I was looking for accommodation for my visit during the Olympics in late 2007, most of the major hotels were not available for booking for IOC-related room blocks. Which means when I booked it everything everywhere was very expensive. Then I found this little courtyard hotel, and was charged at least 4 times their published rates, yet still I am happy with what I got. Situated 3 &quot;layers&quot; deep from the main streets, you will either need to have good map reading skills to navigate your way to find this on your own... or you could use their free tricycle service which would pick you up from either Qianmen or Hepingmen Quanjude Roast Duck Restaurant.I love the surrounding of this guesthouse. It is a typical hutong where houses are one next to the other, and rather peaceful and quiet. That means it's not the best place to stay if you are expecting upper class and polished streets. In fact, you will find at least 3 smelly public toilets along the way to the guesthouse. But that's what's genuine about the neighbourhood. The location is also quite fantastic... a 5-10 minute walk (or less with tricycle) would bring you to the subway station (Hepingmen and Qianmen), and also Tiananmen Square... that's a big plus for those who like to travel the local way (on foot or subway).Rooms are not big, but adequate, with modern bathroom amenities (good and strong hot showers!). Room rates include free use of internet and breakfast (Chinese or western style, pick whatever you want).You cannot reach this place by taxi, so be ready to have a little hassle when you arrive and depart. The tricycle rider is friendly and could get you to the main streets. I arrived in a chauffeured car and the driver had no clue where it was and luckily I did my research and found the property myself. Although I paid the rate for a 5-star hotel, I wouldn't have done it any other way."
"Dec 24 2007 	Nice property	We booked a three bedroom room for $92/nite, each room came with a queen size bed. Also included was a kitchen with frig and microwave, and a washer dryer. There was also a dining area and living room, where we could sit down at night and go over all the booty collected in a days shopping. While the rooms were very spartan and lacked color, the room was very clean. The location is great and I would highly recommend this hotel to everyone, except Leon Helmsley, who would probably prefer the Astoria. Sep 15 2006 	Great hotel for large groups! (and individuals...)	I traveled to Beijing in June 2006 with 6 friends and we needed an inexpensive hotel that would hold our large group. The Century Towers Beijing hotel was PERFECT. We made a reservation through www.sinohotel.com, which I was nervous about at first, not being familiar with them. The customer service reps were fantastic, responding to all my spastic e-mails quickly and with great care. When we arrived at the Hotel, we breezed through check-in and were given the same price quoted on SinoHotel.com so there were no $$ issues. We stayed in a 3-bedroom apartment-style space (the &quot;large&quot; version offered on the website), with 2 full bathrooms (American Standard fixtures) a full kitchen, and a dining room. It even included a washer/dryer in the unit, though we didn't have any need to use it. The apartment was very clean, air-conditioned, and spacious, even with the 7 of us, we had plenty of room to relax! The hotel is across the street from a HUGE supermarket, so we ended up cooking most breakfasts in the room, saving even more money! We kept lots of cold bottled water in the fridge to take with us on our adventures in the hot, dry summer weather of Beijing. The room included a large flat-screen TV in the living room with cable, and a few English-language channels like the BBC (and the Simpsons!)Other really nice aspects of the hotel include a work-out room in the basement with treadmills, stationary bikes, a rowing machine, ballet bar, free weights, and weight machines. The hotel restaurant is very small but serves good food. The wait staff (and most of China) speak very little English, so learn basic Chinese phrases and expec to smile and point a lot :) We are traveling to Shanghai in the Summer of 2007 and if Century Towers has a location there, we would absolutely stay again! I think the price is much cheaper at this hotel because it's a Chinese hotel, not a foreign chain. We paid about $85 USD/night for this large 3 bedroom apartment-style room. Between the 7 of us, the price was certainly right!"
"Nov 4 2009 	Disappointed	The hotel is out of the city centre, about 20 minutes walk to T Square. None of the taxi drivers I had knew where the hotel was - I had to show them on the map and at least 2 had to stop to ask for directions. The staff were not especially friendly or organised. The staff in the restaurant were not at all welcoming to solo travellers. For 2 nights I was sandwiched between a group of schoolgirls who spent their nights running up and down the corridor sqealing. The hotel shop is vastly overpriced - there is a grocery shop just down the road which is a lot cheaper. I'm sure there are better hotels in Beijing for the same price. Aug 1 2009 	good value	The hotel is a well located good a/c quality 3 star hotel, a fact that should be remembered when evaluating ratings. It is easily accessible to all the places you will want to go. Taxis are cheap as are the buses. Get the hotel to write down the name of where you want to go and take the hotel card with you. Pleasant courtyard to sit around with access to the coffee shop, but beware the price of coffee. Good breakfast in upstairs dining room - asian and american and lunch buffet for $8. There is a good massage establishment in the hotel. Jun 22 2009 	would look at other hotels	This is a very large hotel and caters for large groups but there are only two lifts to manage this large number of people. At peak times its very difficult to get on which is very frustrating. Most of the staff I encountered were far from friendly. My tour guide commented she received a large number of complaints from guests who stayed here. I will say though that the room was roomy and lovely and clean. May 31 2009 	Clean room friendly staff..satisfied	My husband and I recently stayed at the Dong Fang for 3 nights and although we cannot comment on its location--we had transportation organized for our whole stay--I must say the room was clean and provides the basic necessities. My major disappointment was the bed..I love a soft bed and unfortunately the bed was of typical Chinese form--not very soft.As for the staff, they were always smiling and always very helpful. We were content with their level of English.As for the breakfast that was included with our package, it wasn't bad..for all the health buffs, I think it could be a problem but for us it filled our stomachs before a long day of tours, no complaints!Be warned that the walls are a bit thin..was woken up at one point by some noise next door, but it didn't ruin our trip. Something to consider **wink wink**Overall, we had a pleasant stay. Have no regrets considering this was an on the spot choice without any research. Oct 21 2008 	Nice hotel	We stayed two nights and had a nice room, enjoyed the breakfast and also had dinner in the hotels both evenings which was nice and also affordable (we ordered off the menu which seemed to be special as most people had the buffet). The only downside is it is not easy to reach with public transport. We travelled to the nearest metro station Heping Gate station and walked down to Zhushikou East St and walked down a very small side street. To go to the airport we caught a taxi which we preordered at reception. Jul 15 2008 	Comfortable hotel good location	We stayed at the Dong Fang Hotel in Beijing for three nights at the beginning of a China tour. The hotel has a good continental breakfast with many choices, both Western and Asian. The coffee and the coffee shop were also quite good. The front desk was helpful and spoke enough English for us to all understand each other. We found that sitting on the beds made them seem hard, but sleeping on them was actually quite comfortable. The TV received three English-speaking channels. Money can be exchanged at the front desk, and there is also an ATM just off the lobby. We thought the best feature of this hotel was its proximity to Tianeman Square--we were able to walk there in about 30 minutes. Overall, we were pleased with the experience. Jun 27 2008	Loved the Dong Fang!	This was our last stop on an organized tour through Shanghai, Xi'an and finally Beijing. The rooms were comfortable and clean. The staff was very helpful and spoke enough English to successfully communicate with a diverse group of travelers who spoke heavily accented French/German/Russian/Australian/etc. English.Also, the daytime assistant manager is a handsome and charming Jet Li look-alike.Great place-will stay again!Beiing is the best! Mar 29 2008 	Nice New Hotel	We stayed at the Dong Fang for a couple of days as part of our tour package with the Great Wall Marathon (which was an incredible experience, I would recommend to even a non-runner). My impression was that the Dong Fang was brand new and had just opened prior to our arrival. All of the hallways smelled like new carpet and everything, from the lobby to the restraunt to the rooms, was very clean. Most of the employees were also new, working on their English phrases, but on the whole very pleasant and helpfull. After checking in, we walked from the hotel to Tiannemen Square - it was certainly not a short walk, about 30 minutes, but we enjoyed the scenery. We walked through one of the classic &quot;hutongs&quot; and a street market en route. Otherwise, your best bet is to get a cab from the hotel to the more popular sites. The location is the only possible downside. Otherwise, the lobby had a nice little bar, great authentic food at the restraunt, and the rooms were very nice with all the amenties you would expect in a modern, western-style hotel, to include the little soaps and shampoos! Mar 19 2008	great hotel	We stayed at the dong fang hotel in beijing mar 2008 on a organised tour round china .I was a bit concerned after reading reviews on this site so i was pleasantly suprised staff were very welcoming and registration went smoothly. We had a double room which looked like it had just being refurbed probaby due to the olympics and bathroom was of a decent size with all the usual freebies. My only dissapointment was the restaurant food it wasnt up to much but that may have been because we were in a group so had a buffet most of the time so cannot comment on indvidual meals. Downstairs in the lobby was a coffee house which was very pleasant although a little expensive for alchol. I would defineatley reccomend this hotel. Beijing itself was good if not a little drab but the pollution was terrible we all went away with sore throats. How they are going to compete in the olympics is beyond me. Mar 8 2008	Nice hotel a bit far out though	Nice hotel, rooms very modern &amp; clean, breakfast lovely &amp; a good choice, surrounding area is a few shops &amp; restaurants, nice coffee shop in the hotel itself. A bit far out to visit all the sights, we were in an organised tour which was great, but independantly it's a bit far out.Had a room on the 12th floor which was fab, offering lovely views over the city. Fairly quiet as high up apart from the end of Chinese New Year!!! It was fantastic &amp; we were treated to fireworkds and firecrackers all over the city! Feb 2 2008	Average But Nice And Friendly	This was the first hotel we stayed in as part of a trip with Voyages Jules Verne. We arrived on Friday 25th January 2008 and given a room on the 8th floor. Although this was a non-smoking room it did in fact smell slightly smokey as smoking is allowed in the corridors. The room itself was ample in size and I found the beds very comfortable. There was an in-room safe and a decent sized bathroom with powerful shower over the bathtub.The reception staff were all very polite and changing money was not a problem. Their rate was better than back home in England offering almost 14 Yuan to the pound.My only little niggle about this hotel was the fact that the staff in the bar were not consistent with their drink prices. Four gin and tonics and a small white wine cost around £16.00. Each evening a crowd of us (16 persons usually) would meet up in the bar at the end of our sight-seeing trips (usually around 9-9.30pm) and have a few drinks. What I did find annoying was that one night a bottle of beer was 20 Yuan and the next night they would charge 22 Yuan. Ok I know it's only an extra 15p but we were good customers and on average each couple would drink about 12 bottles between them so there was no need to rip us off. By the way the bar closes at Midnight.Directly across the road from the hotel is a small brothel and scantily clad girls would parade themselves in the large glass window touting for business. This was not a problem and they never came into the hotel, but if you are a prude you maybe offended. Our group consisting of various ages did'nt have a problem with this. In fact it was a talking point.It was only when we went to Shanghai during the second part of our holiday and stayed in the Jinshajiang hotel (What a joke) that I really appreciated just how nice the Dong Fang was in comparrison.I have rated this hotel a three, but it probably derserves a three and a half. Dec 24 2007 	Not great	We were booked here for 3 nights as part of a tour. The bed was very hard, could have slept on the floor. Bed linen and pillows smelled of smoke. Hotel staff were not friendly although the doorman was good.Room was not over clean. Buffet Breakfast was good with a range to choose from the buffet.Would not stay at this hotel again. Nov 25 2007	A comfortable place to stay with a good bar	this is a comfortable and clean 4 star hotel centrally located in Beijing although, given the size of the city, it's still a taxi or bus ride from the sights. Friendly staff and a pleasant coffee shop which is in an older part of the building has lots of character. Distant views from the higher floors of Beijing through the smog. There's a good variety of European and Chinese foods for breakfast and the cafe, named 1918 after the date the original part of the hotel was built, doubles as a great bar. Check the address carefully to make sure you have the right hotel as there are a few DongFang hotels as it means “dynasty” in Chinese. Oct 22 2007	great hotel exceeded our expectations!!!	This hotel was where we were booked to stay at the end of a tour and we were a bit apprehensive,but it was great, exceeded our expectations!! We were able to check in at 8am after an overnight train journey from Shanghai.Staff were helpful and friendly although not all spoke fluent. English.The room was spacious, bright and spotlessly clean.Lovely comfortable bed,very modern and clean bathroom(no bathtub, just a shower) with bed linen and towels changed and bathroom toiletries replenished daily.Breakfast was an extensive western and chinese buffet with eggs cooked to order.It was busy but well organised.Insulated jugs of tea and coffee were on the tables.Internet was available from the business centre.Coffee shop was also good.Only problem we had in Beijing was with Taxis.They didnt seem to want to take westerners!!!Other members of our group had problems as well.They would only bring you back to the hotel for a fixed rate of 40 or 50 RMB.When going into the city the hotel called taxis for us several times and the fare was metered, usually 25 to 30 RMB.What will happen in 2008 and the city is flooded with westerners there for the Olympics???? Apart from that we had a great stay.Silk Street shopping centre is great for shopping ,at night we went to Snack Street near Wangfuging Street and as well as shops, one side of the road has loads of food stalls with all sorts of food, cooked as you wait ,a great experience! If you are very brave you can try scorpion!!!!We hope to return to Beijing and would stay at The Dong Fang Hotel again. Jan 20 2007	Ok only	This hotel is ok. It can use a bit of updating. Somewhat clean rooms and bathrooms. Breakfast buffet was quite extensive with both western and chinese styles. Guests were allowed to smoke in the dining room. Internet access in the business center on first floor (RMB1/minute). Hotel is about 5 minutes walk to the Merry Mart Supermarket where you can get your supply of bottled water, snacks and other essentials. There are some non-legal cab drivers hanging out outside the hotel. Be sure to get one who uses the meter. It costs RMB15 to get you from the hotel to Wangfujing street (Tiananmen Sq and Forbidden City). Same vice versa. If the driver quotes you a fixed price, find another cab! They can be quite pushy. The hotel apparently does not discourage illegal cabbies from trying to get customers inside the hotel. Jul 6 2006	The Beijing Dong Feng Hotel	I recently stayed at the Beijing Dong Feng Hotel as part of my Exodus Adventure trip and it exceeded my expectation.The hotel has recently been refurbished. The rooms were large and comfortable. The bathroom was clean and spacious with fresh towels everyday.There was also a buffet breakfast every morning including fresh fruit, juices, eggs, sausages, toast etc and tea and coffee.The staff were friendly and it has a great location. Not far from all the main sights in Beijing. I would stay here again. May 29 2006	Beijing Dongfang hotel was reasonable 	Stayed in this hotel as part of a Great Wall Marathon group. All rooms being totally refurbished and while still 3 star, is good. location is a relatively short walk or a very cheap taxi to Tianemen Square. Good breakfast included in our price. Staff can speak some english. Mar 4 2005	Simple but ok hotel	The Dong Fang Hotel was included in my trip. Lobby is nice. Hotel rooms are simple (outdated) but clean. Employees where friendly, had no problems. Breakfast was simple (in western restaurant). Stayed for one week. Location is perfect, walk in about 30 minutes to Tiananmen Square / Forbidden city. Taxi to centrum will cost you about 1.5$ in 10 minutes from the Hotel. TV with 2 English channels (HBO and ?).Overall: Ok hotel to stay but rooms are simple, if you have a choice maybe go to a higher standard one.R.P. / Netherlands Dec 3 2004	Okay Hotel but hookers everywhere?!	I stayed in the Dong Fang Hotel, Beijing around a month ago (20th October) for several days. The lobby is quite decent initially and overall the hotel seems good, however on closer inspection the hotel is quite dirty, the rooms were not very nice at all. However, perhaps, since this was my first time in China, it is a typical standard there, yet for my British standard it wasn't really good enough.But by no means is it a terrible hotel, and by all means for reasonable accomadation stay there. I did have another problem which was that hookers were everywhere in the hotel, there was a so called 'Karaoke' bar from in the lobby, and a 'nightclub' no the top floor. Yet they were both quite clearly brothels, though once again perhaps this is typical in China but was slightly unerving for me. Oct 29 2007 	waren positiv überascht!!"
"Dec 2 2008 	Love it Love it	I stayed at this hotel for one night in November. The person who booked this hotel told me that it was recently remodeled right before the Olympics. With $90 a night, I was more than willing to give it a try. It's off the crazy 3rd Ring road (San Huan), so traffic seems moderate. US and Japanese embassies are within walking distance. There is a food street adjacent to it. I did not get a chance to explore it. It can be an interesting place to get a bite if you are tied of the hotel menus. I had a single room with a king size bed. Not huge space, but plenty room for what I need. It's well decorated, modern and hi-tech, and smells clean too. The bed is very comfortable. Sheets and towels show very little use. The LCD TV has many international channels, American, French, German, Russian, Japanese, Korean, Australian ... plus many more I can't even recognize. The breakfast was only okay, not a huge selection compared to what I had elsewhere, but not bad either for 80 yuan. I changed American dollars to local yuan at its business center at an incredible rate 6.795 while other hotels usually gave me 6.4 or even lower. Overalll, to me, it is a smaller version of Hilton, just one block away across the street. You only pay half of Hilton's price. I will definitely stay there again next time. Oct 21 2008 	Great value great hotel all around	When I booked this hotel, I had some pretty low expectations knowing that in China sometimes you get exactly what you pay for, and often even that ratio is a stretch. What a pleasant surprise I had when I got into my room, it was absolutely clean and perfect for my business trip. I had stayed at the intercontinental hotel a few weeks before in Beijing for literally 5 times the price of the Guangming, and the room was almost exactly the same. The stigma of Chinese hotels has finally been reversed, long live the Guangming... The lobby was clean and 5 star-ish, the service was excellent, but the rooms were exemplary and this hotel is certainly one I'll go back to for all of my business trips in the future. Booking with Ctrip gave me some sort of special on free internet in my room which was another little bonus of this place. The only annoying thing was the breakfast, which though edible was certainly not anywhere close to the intercontinental. But then again, with the money I saved I made sure to treat myself to a nice brunch at a nice brunch spot in the embassy district. A good hotel all around, and its a great location, check it out and thank me later."
"Oct 9 2009 	Excellent location for walking/exploring and fabulous breakfast for China!	h my nine year old daughter and would normally overlook hostels, but I was drawn to this one by the reviews and location. The ensuite with two twin beds was small but convenient, with cozy duvets and cable TV. (Also includes an electric water pot and tea, a chair, desk and side table.) For $37 US, it was a very good deal, especially in all the hubbub leading up to the 60th Anniversary. The bathroom had a strong sewer smell (welcome to China; it's pretty normal) and the one extra electric outlet was broken, but it was generally clean and the public areas were immaculate.The hostel is tucked in a quiet alley not far (maybe one block) from a bus stop. (Catch the #2 on the same side of street as the hostel to head to Tiananmen East/ #1 subway line or Qianmen/ #2 line) It is nestled between the Forbidden City and WanfangJie, the walking &amp; shopping street. It is also just a few blocks from the Night Market (tasty and exotic treats - from candied fruits to grilled lizards and seahorses), which runs from about 6-10 pm nightly. My daughter is pretty tough for 9 and we walked all over the city, but the front desk will also help arrange taxis or the information room attendant can help with travel logistics. They also have several tours they'll sell you (expensive compared to using public transit, but competitive prices compared to other tour operators). We opted for public transit and had a blast (and total solitude!) at Great Wall Simatai. We walked to the Forbidden City, to JingshanYuan (2 kuai, highest point in the city with a bueatiful temple that looks straight down on the Forbidden City), Bei Hai Park (20 kuai, with 5 kuai ferry rides across the lake and plenty of cultural relics and nice park areas) and all around T Square. We also used the subway often, which was crowded but easy to navigate and VERY cheap (2kuai per single journey).We were gone all day every day, so took advantage of the safe lockers by the front desk - 1 kuai each time you lock it but well worth it &amp; big enough for a computer and small personal items.We stayed several days and enjoyed the breakfast - the best I've seen in China, even in the fancier high dollar hotels. It always had a couple of Chinese dishes (spring rolls, noodles, fried rice,) either scrambled or fried eggs plus boiled eggs, croissants &amp; jam, veggies and dressing, meusli and fresh yogurt and fruit. The breakfast area and reading room are nicely decorated in traditional style, and don't forget to try on the Emperor/ Empress suits in the Information room and get your photo! (Take your own photo, but donning the suits is free.)There is a supermarket (turn left outside the alley, about one block on left) with plenty of fresh fruits &amp; veggies and even some western niceties (lunch meat &amp; sliced bread - even wheat!) without the upscale import prices. There's decent wireless internet in the lobby, and I was sometimes also able to pick it up in the room. It's free, but I believe there's a small charge for using their computers in the internet room.Overall, the staff was really friendly but not necessarily very helpful. They speak some decent English and run to help you with taxis, but if there is a problem you may get the Asian shrug-off. With the great location, breakfast, and moderately nice facility, I would certainly stay again and recommend it to friends. Had I not had my daughter, I would not have opted for the ensuite - save yourself the stink and get an even better deal for a fabulous location! As always, take ear plugs just in case! (I never needed mine.) Aug 20 2009 	Great place to stay	Really affordable with friendly staff. Located about 10 mins from Forbidden City which is a must see attraction. Handy supermarket a couple of doors down, with really cheap water and other food stuffs. If you opt for breakfast as a extra it's a little expensive compared with food everywhere else at 30Y , but is an all you can eat, we enjoyed the museli. The information office here are really helpful and can book tours along the great wall etc. and train tickets, they found us cheap flights to Hong Kong. Jul 29 2009 	Jade International Youth hotel	Excellent budget hotel with all the facilities that you need. In walking distance for shopping and most of the major sights.Would recommend to anyone. Jun 10 2009 	Good value in great location	Friendly staff, secure and pleasant facilities, right in heart of historic area. While there are more exotic and charming hostelling locations in the city, this facility is a well-run hotel-like option (as opposed to siheyuan/courtyard house option) within 10 minute walk of the east end of Tiananmen Square. However, being halfway down a long alley, it is not a well-known hotel nor is it an easy location to describe to a taxi driver.Free WiFi in the lobby is a nice amenity. Hostel staff took my heavy rolling luggage and escorted me into the lobby when I first arrived--better service than expected! They also watched the courtyard to ensure those who entered were residents or had business there.I was pleased with my three night stay. Apr 9 2009 	Exceptionally Good	We booked just the one night here due to time constraints.The service was excellent - polite, efficient and informed.We were surprised by quite how good the en-suite twin room was. This is only supposed to be a hostel but it is 3-star hotel standard.The location is excellent - close by the Forbidden City and a leisurely 15-minute stroll down to Tian'anmen Square. The nearest metro (Dengshikou, I think it was) is about 10 minutes walk away (once you realise that it's quicker walking down the alleys) and the nearest bus stop is about two minutes away.The amenities are very good - reception, restaurant and tourist office.We liked everything about this place.If you require very comfortable accommodation in a very central location with very helpful staff then this place is it - at an unbeatable price. Feb 18 2009 	Love this hostel :)	This hostel is so cool. Staff are all friendly and nice. Clean rooms. Wi-fi access in lobby is very useful. Location also rocks. Rates are very affordable. You'll be amazed when you see the rooms. If you'll go to Beijing, I will suggest that you stay here. More value for money? Stay in this hostel :) It's also near food strip. Nov 2 2008 	Hotel standard rooms...	Rooms here are small, but clean. We stayed in a standard room with private ensuite. TV in room. Comfortable bed. Room is cleaned daily, and towels, soap, toothbrushes etc are provided. Chinese style bathroom: no partition between the shower area and the rest of the bathroom. Good location: 10 mins walk to Forbidden City or Wangfujing shopping street. Free bike hire with 600 RMB deposit. Free wireless internet in the lobby and bar area. Otherwise you can use their computers for 1 RMB for 6 minutes. Huge common area with TV, stereo and couches and books to read.Can be a little noisy at night, so bring ear-plugs if you are a light sleeper. Reception staff are very helpful with directions etc. Washing machine and dryer facilities available for a fee. They provide a free pick-up service from Beijing Railway Station if you call in advance. We took the Airport Bus from PEK (18 RMB), then jumped in a cab to get to the hostel. Cab driver got lost, so we had to put him on the phone to the hostel. Buffet breakfast is 35 RMB. Eggs, onion rings, toast, croissants, fried rice, noodles etc. Ok, but not fabulous. Apr 16 2008 	Loved the fish tank	Booked accommodation through a language school - stayed for just over two weeks. I have never stayed in a youth hostel and didn't know what to expect this experience was a good one. I had a room on the third floor, twin for single use with shower room(standard). I didn't have any problems with noise, just the occasional late returner to hotel at weekend and that can be the same in any hotel. The hotel was refurbished about two years ago. The shower room is modern with pretty good fittings, tiled floor modern toilet (a toilet to sit on is not always found in Beijing) hairdryer and regular supplies of toilet paper, towels changed every day. Bedroom is part tiled and part wood effect flooring. TV and kettle provided with a couple of T bags every day. Lighting in room is OK but if you like reading in bed take a mini light. The hotel has a lot of English speaking staff - some have the minimum few words others a pretty good command of the language and they battle with the dozens of accents they come across every day. Comfortable seating in the reception area try to be there when they feed the fish with other tiny live fish. Seating area in the bar with big widescreen TV with DVDs available. Food and drink prices are reasonable, bar food is mostly western style and aimed at backpackers/students. Its not bad though and I believe Chinese food is available but I'm not sure when because I never managed to be there. Breakfast buffet is now 35 yuan. Food OK. Tea and coffee arrangements are hit and miss. Take your own tea bag and ask for hot water. Coffee isn't bad if it is hot. Internet access is not wireless so if you have skype etc you need the right equipment pay at reception and then find your allocated PC. The hotel is clean, well serviced and the staff are friendly and helpful. The hotel position is great for walking to sights - it won't suit you if you want a subway station on the doorstep. No problem if you understand the bus routes or are prepared to walk (about 15 mins). The hotel has the required cards to show taxi drivers to get you to the tourist areas or back to the hotel. If you are going to use the taxis a lot get someone in the hotel to write out the address in large print. Lots of the taxi drivers just need to wear glasses for reading! If you find a good taxi driver try to get their card and get a quote for anything you want to do farther afield. 3 or 4 people in a taxi to the wall is cheaper than an organised bus trip and you can get their earlier before the crowds.Beijing is safe to walk around, the area is residential so you won't see that many people late at night but it's OK even as a lone female. The people in the hutong close to the hotel are pleasant and used to the guests tramping through on the way into the centre. Bikes can be rented and tours/cars to airport can be arranged by the hotel. Changing money at reception is actually cheaper than using an ATM. Security boxes available 1 yuan per use. Dec 10 2007 	Great Budget Accomodations	I booked a private room at this youth hostel. Having stayed at hostels before, I can say this was much better than most, if not all. Clean, all the amenities you could ever want or need, and you can't beat the location. Dec 2 2007 	Great location - friendly staff and clean	Myself and my girlfriend stayed at the Jade Youth Hostel for a few nights while passing through Beijing. The location is fantastic - only a few minutes walk from the Forbidden City.Our room was very clean. Staff spoke decent english. Staff also booked our train tickets to Xi'an and a tour to the Great Wall.I would definately recommend this hostel if staying in Beijing. It looks more like a hotel than a hostel - so not so cozy - but definately comfortable.Rgds,GPS Sep 3 2007 	Beijing Jade international youth hostel	I booked this hostel through (--) (v good website that contains unbiased reviews from travellers)I stayed in the Beijing Jade Youth Hostel (part of international hostelling)address is No.5, North Zhide Alley, Beiheyan Street,, Dongcheng District costs 75Y (=£6) for one bed in a 4 bed dorm for one night (shared bathroom outside of room). They also have 6 bed dorms and twins with ensuite.It is very smart, clean, light and airy for a hostel. You can also get a breakfast buffet for 25Y and the nice communal bar area does food throughout most of the day. They have a tourist info office and you can arrange tours to great wall etc.I found it to be in the best location compared to othe hotels and hostels. It is walkable to forbidden city, tiannmen sqaure, main shopiing street, night market. Beijing is a very pread out city so be prepared to walk alot.Best way to get around is by taxi (cheap) - beijing is a very speard out city so be preparedt o do a lot of walking.I took the shuttle bus from airport to just opposite the department stores on Xichang'an jie - you can then walk to hostel = 40 min or take a taxi for 30Y.I was a single female travelling on my own and found it to be a safe city. Just be wary of young people coming up to you posing as struggling art students who then take you to their art shop and conn you into buying paintings that are a lot more exp than what you can get in the market. Also be careful of the rickshaw drivers. I had an experience where i wanted to go from A to B and I bartered for a price before hand. He then took me on a long tour of the backstreets with historical facts and then demanded a lot more money!English is spoken by very few and those few only speak it to a degree so best to always have a map in english AND CHINEESE so you can point to where you want to go as taxi drivers tend not to speak english.It is a facinating city on the verge of change as they are preparing for the 2008 olympics. Lots of construction work going on! Apr 3 2007 	Superb buget accomodation in Beijing	I have been teaching in China for seven months now and I have stayed a total of nearly 40 nights at the Jade Youth Hostel. The rest of thetime I live in a City some two hours away.If your looking for something cheaper than the hotel chains, the likes of Novotel etc, but something better than a typical YHA Youth Hostel, this place fits the bill. Everything about it is superb. From the friendly staff, spottlessly clean reception, great bar, tasty restaurant to the clean and comfy rooms. Located just 5mins walk from The Forbidden City, this gives you an idea of its great central location. For the cheapest way to book, go via www.hostelbookers.com or one of the similar sites. You get it slightly cheaper than paying at the front desk, though at the prices they ask, its not much at all! For a single bed in an 8 person dormitory - Y50. A single bed in a 4 person dormitory - Y60. Neither are en-suite, instead they share a shower room and toilet room. Both are cleaned very regularly, and are spotless for the majority of the time. Above that, a private double en-suite costs Y200 for the room. Having stayed in all of them, I would advise the 4 bedroom dorm over the 8, only because it can sometimes get a little noisy with people coming and going from the 8 person. The private rooms are ideal for those wanting a little more privacy.There is a tour agent within the hostel, where it is possible to book taxis to the airport, visits to the Great Walk and other City tours, all of which I've tried and found perfect.There is an internet bar that does what it says on the tin, cheaply (5Y for 30mins). The Bar / Lounge is very popular. A chill-out place to watch movies during the day, and a great place to warm up before going out on the night, with beers a mere Y4 and table football. There are some other hostels nearby that I have heard good reviews from too, but the fact that I never felt the need to go elsewhere on one of my many visits speaks for itself.The easiest way to get there is to jump in a taxi, call the front desk of the hostel, and get them to direct the taxi driver. Simple and easy. Apr 24 2006	Sound sleeper?	While the hotel had great prices (cheaper booking online in advance) and the rooms were adequate it's quite noisy. Not only are other guests yelling at each other in the thin walled hallways (they do have shhhh please signs posted to no avail), but one morning the employees were even on their walkie-talkies at 5:30am with the thing buzzing back and forth. If you're a light sleeper, it's not great. The rooms are on the small side but good enough for two of us, the shower is part of the bathroom so the whole floor gets wet, most of the hostel type part is spread out so there isn't that meeting others feeling. The taxi had to call them twice on the way from the airport to find them but they are located within walking distance of a few places and it's easy enough to get a taxi at the end of the street, even at 5:30 in the morning! We'd stay again, it wasn't awful, it just wasn't great. Nov 17 2005	Beijing Jade Youth Hostel - Great budget accomdation	We stayed at the Beijing Jade Youth Hostel (Address: 5 Zhide Beixing, Beiheyan Dajie) in Beijing in September 2005 and we would highly recommend it to anyone looking for cheap but decent accomodation in the city. I think we paid around US$15-20maximum for a double room with ensuite. They also have dorm rooms available which are much cheaper... Nov 17 2005	comodo e assolutamente dignitoso"
"Oct 25 2009 	New hotel with great rooms and great price.	I stayed at Ragegast Beijing for one night in Beijing. The rooms are top notch, easily comparable if not better than hotels in Beijing for double its price. Overall, no complaints. If you don't mind a not so fashionable part of the town for a great value, I would recommend it. Sep 8 2009 	Postive surprise!	A typical Chinese 5-star hotel. In measures and meters and facilities the hotel has everything what a 5-star hotel should have. On the other hand it is all very Chinese. Not always do the things function, the staff speaks a little tono English, so ifyou try to explain something it takes a bit more creativity. What was a pitty that there is no nice hotel bar and all restaurants close already at 10pm. The way the hotel is furnished and the size ofthe rooms are fantatstic. Also location is excellent. In fact quiet but very central. Much nicer to stay in a Chinese 5 star hotel then the well known international chains. Would come here any time again. Apr 29 2009 	First class hotel	After the Beijing Olympics we stayed in this beautiful hotel, which we had found on-line. We soon noticed that it was brand new with a few growing pains but a spectacular property with accommodating and helpful staff, beautifully appointed rooms and gorgeous bathrooms! At first we were uncertain about the location because it seemed quieter than anywhere else we had stayed in Beijing but soon learned that the neighbourhood was classy, young and had much to offer. Apr 28 2009 	I can't believe they treat guests this way	When I searched for a hotel to stay for a family trip to Beijing, I found many reviews. When I read about Radegast I decided I would stay there, especially since most of the reviews were quite favorable. However, after 3 nights of no air conditioning and mentioning this each day, nothing was done to fix the problem. It is not unreasonable to expect those in the hospitality industry to remedy issues. This leads me to the conclusion that I will not stay at this hotel again! The first day we alerted the staff to the problem (which they said they’d fix) and when we returned that night it wasn't fixed. The second morning, we again reported the issue to which they said they would &quot;fix&quot; the problem. Again the hotel did nothing other than to make promises and treat our complaint as less than serious. Finally, on the third morning, we asked for the manager. At this point, they told us that they would move us, to which we declined. At this point it was too late and they could have done the first night to another room. However since we were leaving the next day, we were not going to pack, settle in to a new room, only to repack to leave the next morning. In our opinion, it was pointless. Why did it take 3 days to be taken serious? Our hotel room temperature was between 25 and 27 Celsius during which the weather was around 28 Celsius outside. In fact, the manager blamed the lack of air conditioning on the temperature outside. The manager even argued with us that if we opened the unscreened windows that it would have been cooler in our room. Is this how guests should be treated? During this conversation, we continued to complain, this time more vocally, that this shouldn't matter and they were just not going to not solve the problem. We received the usual &quot;apologies&quot; but without any satisfaction. This for a $300 a night room!!! They wouldn't refund nor do anything to remedy the situation. This is rated a 5 star hotel and yet do not handle complaints with seriousness nor treat their guests with any dignity. Our rooms were very uncomfortable due the temperature and I don’t think that this is a minor issue. My 75 year old father in-law’s room was the same. If you are contemplating this hotel, my advice would be to go elsewhere. If you should have any issue with the hotel, they will dismiss your complaint and you will have no recourse. Mar 1 2009 	Smart modern and new	This is another excellent, new facility in Beijing. The rooms are spacious and well-appointed with excellent facilities. The complimentary buffet breakfast was of a high-quality, with swift, low-key service. The hotel is within 10 minutes walk of most CBD buildings and the nearest subway station. While not as conveniently located as other hotels in the area business travellers should find its location acceptable. Tourists may find its location less ideal for their needs. Given that it offers nothing more than other hotels in the area, I'd chose it over others largely on the basis of price. Feb 12 2009 	Very Nice But	Very impressive hotel with great rooms with many amenities. Loved the soaking tub with the mirror / TV. Everything about the rooms and the hotel appearance are top notch. Stand up shower has overhead sprays and adjustable body spray. Hotal has a very nice spa with swimming and workout facility. The workout room is a little small and limited but more than enough for my limited exercise when on business. Hotel has 4 restaurants all with good food but the prices are a bit high. You can get a better meal for a lower price just walking a few blocks or taking a cab someplace. Would recomend Hatsume which is across the street for shushi or Machioni's (probably spelled wrong) which is just a block away on the 2nd floor. For the cost I would highly recomend staying because it was in my opinion a great value. Some of the Butt'sHotel HVAC is eaither set to heat or cool for entire hotel Therefore depending on when you stay you can only make the room temp higher or lower but you don't have the choice of which one. We stayed in Feb and the room's were 80 degrees and there was nothing to be done since the building was set to heating. We tried opening windows but this did little to help. I'm sure for some times of the year this isn't an issue but it was a major issue for us. SPA / Fitness Center hours are not condusive to working out in the morning. Brochures said it opened at 7:00 the front desk told us 6:30 but it actually opened at 8:00 and we had to be at work by then. It also closes promptly at 10:00 so if you get back late from a business dinner there is really no room to workout. The people working the SPA were over attentive. Maybe in some cultures this is very nice but personally it was past creepy having people always around you and ushering you from the front desk to the locker rooms to the locker and trying to help you undress. This was anything but relaxing for me. I would have been much happier being handed a locker key and let to go on my way and if I need help just have someone around I can ask. I had a massage and the actual service was very good (though expensive for China) and as soon as she was done I was ushered out of the room to the locker room and then to the front desk by several different people. They could really take some leasons in how they could create a better more relaxed and enjoyable enviroment. Staff is very friendly but still working on their english skills. I didn't have an issue with this some of the guys I was satying with did. Just know if it's something you require. Hope this helps. agan hotel appearance and the rooms outstanding jsut have an issue with the temperature control and spa/ workout facilities. Dec 28 2008 	Love the Radegast	I first stayed at Radegast for a business trip, and I liked this hotel right away during this trip. So now every time I go to Beijing, I stay at Radegast. It is a very modern, comfortable and well-managed hotel in the center of the business district of Beijing. The location is very convenient. I stayed at other five-star hotels in Beijing before, but I prefer Radegast the most.  The hotel staff is very friendly and their services are superb. Check-in is speedy. The concierges are very helpful, too. Every time I go to the airport from the hotel, the concierges help me find my airline's terminal number and tell the taxi driver. The hotel rooms are extremely clean and cozy with modernized lighting systems and electric curtains. The hotel has five fine restaurants that offer various delicious cuisines from Chinese to American to French. I personally like their French restaurant the most. It's French cuisine is very authentic. Their indoor sunshine swimming pool is fabulous. It's a big swimming pool with a constant warm water temperature. The pool attendants and gym staff treat guests like kings. You have to try. The hotel is also very close to several big shopping centers, such as Shin Kong Place, and many local restaurants. All within walking distance. Overall, Radegast's location and services are excellent. I like this hotel and would definitely recommend this hotel to my friends. Dec 20 2008 	Great stay !	We stayed in Radegast hotel for 6 nights in the end of September. the rooms were absolutely dreamy, specuosly clean, and very pampering. we got a great price from Hotels.com, 65$ per night, and this was defenitely the best hotel we stayed in for such a price (anywhere in the world). we were a little afraid since the hotel seemed to be far from the city center, but as soon as we got to China we realized that taxis are SO cheap, and the city is HUGE, so 5 minutes by taxi and 12 yuan, and we were right in the city center. so this is by no means a disadvantage. Oct 19 2008 	A 5 star potential	The Radegast was the first of two five start hotels that we stayed in while in Beijing (the other was Marriott City Wall) from 10/5/08 thru 10/17/08. In general, this hotel was great, but a bit on the unfinished side given that it was only operational sometime in 8/08. Let me start with the location. Our first impression of the location was a bit negative, it didn't look like there was much around the area; however, after talking to some staff members and exploring a bit, we found out that there was actually a great deal of conveniences located within walking distance of the hotel (e.g. Walmart-- to get water, do not drink tap water in China, small fast food Chinese style restaurants, high end shopping malls with very nice restaurants). There is a subway stop (Guomao Station) approximately 15-20 min walk. A closer station is under construction. The hotel doesn't look that impressive from the outside; but once you get into the lobby, it's another story. You will be greeted at the door by the hotel's door person immediately and whisked away to the front desk. The lobby is full of marble columns and glass made adornments. The room was also quite luxurious with very modern color scheme and theme, flat screen TV built within the wall, very soft sheets, a lounging couch, a formal business desk, very impressive bathroom (with a TV). For whatever reason, the bathroom has a glass wall that can see to the living area of the room (an electronic curtain is used to create privacy). The hotel features 5 restaurants, a business center, a spa, an awesome pool, but a small gym. The quality of the service from the staff was 10 out of five! They were extremely courteous and professional. On one particular occasion, I left my guidebook in the cab. I asked one staff (concierge—Eddy, young guy in his early 20’s) to call the cab company on behalf of me to query about this. He not only did so, but he actually made arrangement for the cab driver to return my guide to the hotel. But I was only able to communicate this with my broken Mandarin as Eddy spoke very little English. Although the service was very courteous, it could be to the extreme. For example, when you go to the gym, two staff members, will greet you at the entrance and personally walk you to the gym. Another staff will follow you around the gym. Now the extreme part comes when I went to take a shower after using the steam room. A staff member actually asked me if I wished to let him put on my clothes! I’m not kidding. Needless to say, I politely refused. I think a lot of the staff was told to treat the customers with extreme luxury and some staffs (perhaps from the country side) interpreted this to treat guests like emperors. The restaurants looked really impressive; but a bit on the expensive side. One that we tried was the Radegast Food Bazzar (3rd floor), it serves local snack foods but made by expert chefs and served with a silver spoon. The taste was amazing. Some of the negatives includ
