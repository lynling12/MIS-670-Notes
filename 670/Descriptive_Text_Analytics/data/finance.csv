"Must-know: Twitter stock has been hot, but is it a good deal? Twitter stock as appreciated rapidly since its recent IPO, but is it worth the price? Find out why we think Twitter is a bad deal. http://finance.yahoo.com/news/must-know-twitter-stock-hot-193451595.html Must-know: Twitter stock has been hot, but is it a good deal? - Yahoo Finance Must-know: Twitter stock has been hot, but is it a good deal? December 30, 2013 2:34 PM Why Twitter is like the cronut—in demand, but hyped and overvalued (Part 1 of 5) One of the buzziest topics in the investing world lately has been Twitter (TWTR). The social media company was one of the most sought-after IPOs of the year as the stock popped to $44.90 per share on its first trading day, after the IPO priced at $26 per share. Since then, the stock has had a strong rally and closed on December 20, 2013, at $63.75 per share, resulting in a market cap of over $36 billion. However, the market’s perception of Twitter’s valuation is far beyond the company’s fundamental valuation. We’re not saying the stock will decline in price, but we can say that where it’s priced is probably not what it’s worth, and that relative to its comps, Twitter is probably too expensive. Read on to find out why we think Twitter is a bad deal from both a relative and absolute value perspective. Continue to Part 2 Browse this series on Market Realist: Part 2 - What is Twitter?

(NYSE: JKS) and ... http://finance.yahoo.com/news/secondary-offerings-jinkosolar-shutterstock-send-161000001.html Secondary Offerings at JinkoSolar, Shutterstock Send Shares Higher - Yahoo Finance Secondary Offerings at JinkoSolar, Shutterstock Send Shares Higher September 20, 2013 12:10 PM It is not often that a secondary stock offering sends a company’s shares higher, but we are seeing that very phenomenon Friday morning. Chinese solar PV maker JinkoSolar Holding Co. Ltd. ( JKS ) and stock image company Shutterstock Inc. ( SSTK ) both priced secondary offerings this morning and shares in both companies have risen sharply. At JinkoSolar, shares priced at $16.25, after closing Thursday night at $16.48, and shortly before noon the stock was up by 13.8% at $18.75. The company offered 3.8 million shares and an underwriters’ option on an additional 570,000. JinkoSolar says it will use proceeds for general corporate purposes, which may include expanding its manufacturing capacity. That by itself should have sent shares down. ALSO READ: Famous Restaurant Chains That Are Hard to Find Shutterstock closed last night at $60.32 and priced its offering of 4.6 million shares at $60.00 this morning. The company is selling only 1 million shares; the rest are being sold by some existing shareholders. The underwriters have an option on an additional 690,000 shares. The company said the purpose behind the offering is to increase the company’s public float, among other things. As far as JinkoSolar is concerned, part of the reason for the price jump is almost certainly a short squeeze. Institutional investors also are likely the heaviest buyers as they move toward some momentum stocks to juice up returns. ALSO READ: The Countries with the Most Multimillionaires Shutterstock only had a public float of about 6.5 million shares, so it is likely adding liquidity. The stock is up more than 200% since the company’s IPO, and we can assume that there are real buyers out there who want in on the party. In addition, nearly 13% of the stock is held short, so there is some covering going on as well. Still, it is an interesting turn of events to see shares jump on secondary offerings. Shares of JinkoSolar are trading at $18.43 a few minutes after noon on Friday, in a 52-week range of $3.18 to $20.06. Shutterstock’s shares are up nearly 12% at $67.46, after posting a new 52-week high earlier this morning of $68.42. The 52-week low is the IPO price of $21.00.

We are seeing major ... http://finance.yahoo.com/news/companies-raising-over-3-billion-140056268.html Companies Raising Over $3 Billion in New Stock Sales - Yahoo Finance Companies Raising Over $3 Billion in New Stock Sales September 10, 2013 10:00 AM The stock market is looking healthier and healthier again, and it is not just because the S&P 500 is within striking distance of 1,700 and because the DJIA has crossed back over 15,000. We are seeing major secondary offerings from companies themselves and from their insiders and backers. When companies sell shares it is generally into a strong market. That being said, investors have to sometimes wonder if they want to buy stock when a company wants to sell more stock to the public. 24/7 Wall St. has tracked offerings from and involving the following companies: Armstrong World Industries Inc. ( AWI ); Enbridge Energy Management LLC ( EEQ ), Enbridge Energy Partners L.P. ( EEP ), Inergy Midstream L.P. ( NRGM ), Marketo Inc. ( MKTO ), Starwood Property Trust Inc. ( STWD ), Stratasys Ltd. ( SSYS ) and Virtus Investment Partners Inc. ( VRTS ). Ten Brands That Will Disappear in 2014 What should really stand out here is not just that these combined offerings come to more than $2.4 billion. We did not include several other offerings, and those in total would come up to close to another $1 billion. We have added color and reference on each offering versus its average volume and size. Armstrong World Industries Inc. ( AWI ) has an offering of 10,057,382 common shares held by Armstrong World Industries, Asbestos Personal Injury Settlement Trust and Armor TPG Holdings. Note that the company has agreed to purchase 5,057,382 of the 10,057,382 common shares of this offering at a price per share equal to the price paid by the underwriter. Shares are trading at $52.37, and the 52-week trading range is $43.30 to $58.48. This is some $520 million in gross dollars, or about $250 million if you back out the shares being repurchased. Seven Highly Educated Jobs Making the Least Money Enbridge Energy Management LLC ( EEQ ) has filed to sell 8 million of its listed shares (units). Proceeds will be used to invest in an equal number of i-units of Enbridge Energy Partners L.P. ( EEP ). Enbridge Partners will then use the proceeds to purchase additional shares to repay its commercial paper, to finance a portion of its capital expansion program and for general partnership purposes. The ""Management-EEQ"" units are down 4% at $28.67, against a 52-week range of $25.81 to $32.30. The ""Partners-EEP"" shares closed at $30.20, versus a 52-week range of $26.88 to $33.49. This comes to almost $240 million before the exercise of any overallotment shares (units). Inergy Midstream L.P. ( NRGM ) is trading down by 4.6%, at $22.19 against a 52-week range of $21.03 to $26.01, after filing to sell 11 million common units. The gross proceeds appear to be around $242 million or so. Be advised that the units are being sold by its limited partners. Marketo Inc. ( MKTO ) already has filed to sell 6 million shares of its common stock, with 5.3 million being sold by existing shareholders and Marketo offering about 700,000 shares in the offering. This offering may seem small at about $200 million, but this is right into a lock-up period since its IPO came out in May. Many investors find offerings in bad taste on a ""Sell as immediately as you can,"" but this one did very well since its IPO as well. Starwood Property Trust Inc. ( STWD ) has priced a 25 million share offering of common stock to raise just over $600 million in gross proceeds. The company intends to use the net proceeds to originate and purchase additional commercial mortgage loans and other target assets and investments, and it included the ""for other general corporate purposes"" disclaimer in the release. The $600 million compares to a market cap of about $4.04 billion, while the 25 million shares compares to an average daily volume of about 2 million shares. Apple: What Happens When Everyone Knows About a Product Release? Stratasys Ltd. ( SSYS ) is selling 4 million shares of its ordinary shares, representing close to $400 million in gross proceeds. Its market cap is just over $4 billion, and it trades about 825,000 shares per day on average. Virtus Investment Partners Inc. ( VRTS ) has done incredibly well as a stock, and it has now filed to sell roughly $175 million worth of its common stock. That would be roughly 1 million shares based on the current price, versus an average daily volume of only about 50,000 shares. Virtus has a market cap of $1.37 billion before the impact of this offering. These were just the offerings that we deemed to be of significant value. There were seven or eight other offerings that probably come close to another $1 billion or so in combined size. As a reminder, when companies and insiders sell more stock, those funds to purchase the new shares on the market generally are used in place of what would have otherwise been market-oriented stocks.

"We're Living in a 'Tech Depression': Andreessen Don't expect a game changing tech IPO anytime soon. Private tech companies are steering clear of going public as long as they can, said Marc Andreessen, the co-founder of the venture capital firm Andreessen ... http://finance.yahoo.com/news/were-living-tech-depression-andreessen-100130066.html We're Living in a 'Tech Depression': Andreessen - Yahoo Finance We're Living in a 'Tech Depression': Andreessen May 14, 2013 6:01 AM Don't expect a game changing tech initial public offering anytime soon. Private tech companies are steering clear of going public as long as they can manage, said Marc Andreessen, the co-founder of the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, on CNBC's ""Closing Bell"" Monday. ""When you say what's the next big IPO, the brutal truth is I don't know and I'm not sure there is going to be one for quite while because the incentives are so strong to keep these companies private,"" Andreessen said. : Software Out, Hardware Start-Ups In ) The hangover felt from the dot-com crash and financial crisis has spurred an era of over regulation in the public markets which has essentially caused a backlash from private companies that are refusing to go public, Andreessen said. Emerging entrepreneurs see the public markets as ""incredibly hostile,"" he said. ""The new running theory among new entrepreneurs is never take your company public or don't do it as long as you possibly can,"" Andreessen said. Andreessen, who has invested in tech companies including, Facebook ( FB ), Twitter, and Pinterest, said that another reason tech companies are hesitant to go public is because of the pain still felt from the dot-com crash. : Facebook in Talks to Buy Israel's Waze: Report ) ""A lot of people got burned during the dot-com crash, so I think we are living through the other side of that, I think we are living through sort of the tech depression, is the term I've used,"" he said. ""But at the same time I can tell you that the vast majority of the interesting new companies that are sort of at the $50 million to $100 million revenue stage,that have historically have been the source of the exciting IPOs that put growth into the market, those companies are quite simply staying private, they aren't going public."" : Signs of Another Tech Bubble: VC ) While there were about 8,800 public companies in 1997, there were about 4,100 publicly traded companies in 2012, a decline that can be contributed to a war being waged on the public markets via regulations like Sarbanes-Oaxley and Regulation FD, which were put in place to help derisk the market. But these regulations do more harm than good, Andreessen said. (Read More Below the Video.) ""We seem to have collectively decided as a society that we want to strip risks out of the public markets, so we had the dot-com crash, we had the financial crisis, and we decided that we don't like risk anymore,"" he said. ""So there have been a series of regulatory reforms, a series of corporate governance movements, and the result has been a huge disincentive for companies to go public, and of course the problem with that is if new companies don't go public then you get exactly what we are seeing, which is the number of public companies falling."" Because the number of public companies is falling, growth is being stripped out of the public markets, which will ultimately pave the way for a two-tiered system, he said. ""If you kill risk, you kill growth. If you kill growth you kill returns. And as a result the market is becoming a two-tiered system and I think that is bad,"" he said. ""Funds like ours-that primarily represent, frankly, rich people, rich people's pensions, rich people's colleges and foreign countries' sovereign wealth funds-generally, are doing fine."" However, he said that on the public side, growth is being drained out of the market, and that could hurt many Americans in the long-term. ""Of course the public market is where most ordinary Americans retirement savings is held in the form of mutual funds and pension funds and if we keep with this approach of over regulation in the public markets, we're not going to have returns for peoples' retirement accounts, which means people aren't going to be able to retire,"" he said. ""And I think that is going to be the big problem that comes out of that and I think that's where we are heading straight towards that right now.""

According to the territory’s South China Morning Post, China’s largest e-commerce company, Alibaba Group, is discussing Nasdaq (paywall) as ... http://finance.yahoo.com/news/alibaba-may-choose-york-over-051625803.html Alibaba may choose New York over Hong Kong for its hotly anticipated IPO - Yahoo Finance Alibaba may choose New York over Hong Kong for its hotly anticipated IPO March 7, 2013 12:16 AM Will Hong Kong lose out on a hotly anticipated jumbo Chinese IPO? According to the territory’s South China Morning Post, China’s largest e-commerce company, Alibaba Group, is discussing Nasdaq (paywall) as the venue for its long-awaited listing. An IPO could value Alibaba at  more than $40 billion , making it potentially the biggest tech IPO in history . If the company chooses a US listing, that would be a further blow to the Chinese territory, where the value of IPOs on the stock exchange plummeted to a four year low last year as mainland China’s economic slowdown made investors less interested in allocating cash there. Chinese internet firms have a long record of choosing the Nasdaq over Hong Kong, mainly because they tend to be fast-growing but also young and loss-making.  The Hong Kong stock exchange requires companies conducting IPOs to have earned a profit for three years before going public. But Alibaba  is profitable  (its part-owner Yahoo discloses its finances).  So it would not be forced to choose a US exchange over Hong Kong in the way that Chinese  social networking business Renren , for example, had to. However, it would be not be unusual if Alibaba were meeting with banks and stock exchange representatives in Hong Kong and New York to see where it would get the best valuation for its shares. Investment bankers in both cities have been crowding around the company and trying to get hired on the IPO. It was reported  (paywall) last month that Alibaba executives were set to meet potential advisers to discuss a Hong Kong listing. Alibaba Group includes Alibaba.com, an online marketplace connecting Chinese manufacturers with overseas buyers, and auction site Taobao. Alibaba.com was previously listed on the Hong Kong exchange. It was taken private by Alibaba Group founder Jack Ma last year in a move widely viewed as a precursor to an IPO of his entire business. An Alibaba Group spokesman declined to comment.

"Professional Diversity Network IPO Struggles Professional Diversity Network¡rsquo;s (NASDAQ: IPDN) IPO fell flat in its market debut yesterday, getting the March initial public offerings market off to an inauspicious start. http://finance.yahoo.com/news/professional-diversity-network-ipo-struggles-195953813.html Professional Diversity Network IPO Struggles - Yahoo Finance Professional Diversity Network IPO Struggles March 6, 2013 2:59 PM Professional Diversity Network’s ( IPDN ) IPO fell flat in its market debut yesterday, getting the March initial public offerings market off to an inauspicious start. The first stock to go public on a U.S. market in nearly three weeks, the Professional Diversity Network IPO declined 4% in its first day of trading and is down another 5.6% today. That doesn’t bode well for the provider of online networking and job opportunities for minorities, which went public below its expected range at $8 a share. It was also a lukewarm kickoff for the March IPO market on the heels of a busy first two months of 2013 . Twelve companies went public in January – the most since 2006. February brought another eight IPOs – less than the last two Februarys, but more than the previous three. The returns have been even better. Year-to-date, the 21 companies that have gone public have returned an average of more than 15%. Only five of them have actually fallen since their debuts – another bad sign for Professional Diversity Network. Up next on the IPO schedule are Artisan Partners Asset Management , a Wisconsin-based investment management business, and Silver Spring Networks , which provides smart grid products and services. According to IPO web site Renaissance Capital, no other public offerings are in the hopper – which could bode for a slower March than in recent years.

And a common point analysts raised just before its 2011 IPO was that Glencore’s majority shareholders may be selling out because they predicted the world resources “supercycle,” as commodities bulls used to call it, was about to be punctured. Glencore’s 2o12 earnings, released today, will have its IPO cynics chuckling at the prescience of their foresight. Last year, Glencore’s net income  crashed 75% . That was partly because of a decline in the value of Glencore’s stake in Russian aluminum producer Rusal, but generally because its sales prices declined as  China’s growth slowed . While the London and Hong Kong flotation  made billionaires of Glencore’s bosses, it’s not at all provable that CEO Ivan Glasenberg saw into the future with mystic accuracy before selling part of his company to outsiders. Maybe he just wanted to spread the fruits of his company’s success more widely and was as surprised by the supercycle accident as many others in the resources industry  (paywall). Still, the IPO timing looks brilliant for those who swapped large stakes in the business for cash. Here is what has happened to Glencore’s London share price (blue line) since its stockmarket debut and with the overall performance of the FTSE 100 (yellow line) provided for reference. Ouch.

"Facebook hits new low as IPO lock-up ends Facebook's stock plunged to a new low Thursday as some of the social networking leader's early backers got their first chance to sell their shares since the company's initial public offering went awry.Analysts ... http://finance.yahoo.com/news/facebook-hits-low-ipo-lock-143200785.html Facebook hits new low as IPO lock-up ends - Yahoo Finance Facebook hits new low as IPO lock-up ends Facebook shares hit new depths as lock-up period ends, providing early investors with an out By Barbara Ortutay and Michael Liedtke, AP Technology Writers August 16, 2012 6:54 PM SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Facebook's stock plunged to a new low Thursday as some of the social networking leader's early backers got their first chance to sell their shares since the company's initial public offering went awry. Analysts interpreted the unusually high trading volume as a clear sign that at least a few of the insiders were seizing on a fresh selling opportunity. That is stirring a debate over whether they're simply locking in long-awaited gains on investments made many years ago or bailing out of a company that has lost its luster. A breakdown on just how many major Facebook Inc. shareholders sold their stock probably won't be available until next week at the earliest. Securities regulations give them at least three business days before they have to disclose such transactions. The information is important ""because if you are an investor who has been sitting on the sidelines waiting for a good time to buy the stock, you might decide to stay on the sidelines for a little longer after seeing which insiders decided to sell their stock,"" CapStone Investments analyst Rory Maher said. All told, investors who owned a combined 271 million Facebook shares could have sold their holdings Thursday with the expiration of a ban known as a lock-up period. The restrictions were imposed on a group of venture capitalists, companies and Silicon Valley cognoscente who invested in Facebook during its formative years and sold some of their holdings three months ago when the company went public at $38. The highly anticipated IPO had valued the company at $104 billion, similar to those of Amazon.com Inc. and PepsiCo Inc. The shares have plunged by nearly 50 percent since then amid concerns about whether Facebook is destined to become a passing fancy and worries about whether it will be able to sell more advertising on mobile devices as users gravitate there. Facebook' stock traded as low as $19.69 before bouncing back slightly. The shares closed Thursday at $19.87, down $1.33, or more than 6 percent. The previous low during the day was $19.82 and the previous low for a close was $20.04, both reached Aug. 2 More than 156 million shares were traded, more than five times the stock's average volume over the past month. Trading in the overall market was lighter than usual. The Facebook investors eligible to sell their shares Thursday included venture capital firms Accel Partners and Greylock Partners; investment banker Goldman Sachs Group; software maker Microsoft Corp.; Zynga Inc. CEO Marc Pincus; LinkedIn Corp. Chairman Reid Hoffman; and former PayPal CEO Peter Thiel. If there was mass selling within this group, Facebook's stock could decline further because the market would be flooded with nearly two-thirds more shares. Given that most of these investors put their money into Facebook five to eight years ago, they probably were eager to sell, said Sam Hamadeh, the CEO of PrivCo, a research firm that follows privately held companies. ""A lot of people have been waiting,"" he said. ""Facebook was expected to go public a long time ago."" Despite the sharp drop in Facebook's market value during the past three months, the early investors can still reap huge windfalls by selling at the current price. For instance, Thiel invested $500,000 in Facebook in 2004, the year CEO Mark Zuckerberg began the site in a Harvard dorm room. After selling 16.8 million shares for $640 million at the time of the initial public offering in May, Thiel still owned nearly 28 million shares worth about $560 million at Thursday's trading prices. Accel Partners invested $12.7 million in Facebook in 2005. The firm sold nearly 58 million shares for $2.2 billion as part of Facebook's IPO and still owned nearly 144 million shares worth about $2.9 billion. It wasn't known how many of those shares could have been sold Thursday, and whether any of them were. Because those investors had put up little compared with the shares' value today, ""you can understand why they would want to take some of their money off the table now,"" Maher said. ""But at the same time, you have to wonder if they're thinking that Facebook isn't much of a bargain anymore."" Hamadeh believes the venture capitalists who invested in Facebook realize it's a ""fool's game"" to wait for a better price on the stock. On the flip side, other key investors seem unlikely to sell additional shares right away. Microsoft, which invested $240 million in Facebook in 2007, relies on Facebook's social network to help bring more traffic to its Bing search engine, making it less likely that it would risk antagonizing Facebook executives by bailing out. The software company also doesn't need the money, as it is already is sitting on $63 billion in cash. A Microsoft spokesman declined to comment Thursday. The selling shackles will come off of an additional 1.66 billion locked-up Facebook shares during the next nine months to place more potential pressure on the stock. One of the biggest tests will come in November when about 1.2 billion insider shares will be eligible for sale. The freed-up shares will include those owned by Zuckerberg, the Facebook CEO and founder who sold 30 million shares for $1.1 billion in the May IPO to cover his taxes. Other Internet companies that have gone public in the past year have been hit hard by the expiration of their lock-up periods. On Tuesday, shares of online reviews service Angie's List suffered their biggest one-day drop so far and closed at a new low following the expiration of a similar ban. The price dropped, even though there was no word on whether any of the major investors had dumped their shares. LinkedIn, which runs a professional networking version of Facebook, also took a big hit when restrictions on insider selling lifted last November. Its shares sank to their trading low of $55.98 after the lock-up period expired, but have since rebounded strongly. The shares closed at $103.99 Thursday, more than twice its IPO price of $45. It appears some investors believe Facebook's stock price is nearing its low point, at least until the next lock-up periods end this fall. Short sellers, a type of investor that bets certain stocks will fall, had been intensifying their focus on Facebook since the company's July 26 report of disappointing revenue growth during the second quarter. To wager against a company, short sellers must borrow the stock of other investors and then make money by paying back the shares at a lower price. The amount of borrowed Facebook shares had spiked from about 70 million before Facebook's second-quarter earnings report to about 92 million at the end of Thursday's trading, said Tim Smith, senior vice president of SunGard Astecs Analytics, which tracks short-selling activity. But sentiments started to shift Thursday as the volume of shares being returned to the lenders outstripped the number being borrowed, Smith said. The cost to borrow Facebook shares also has been declining, a sign that short-selling demand is waning. ""Facebook's stock might be finally bumping along its bottom,"" Smith said. Considering the heavy trading volume, Facebook's stock would have fallen more dramatically if buyers hadn't stepped in, said Louise Yamada, a technical analyst who runs her own research firm. She suspects Facebook insiders are being careful not to flood the market with stock. ""They're smart enough to know if they sell at the same time, the stock would fall,"" Yamada said. It has been a rough run for Facebook. After one of the most-anticipated IPOs in history, Facebook had perhaps the most-botched stock market debut as glitches marred its first day of trading. Things have gotten progressively worse as Facebook's market value has plunged by about $49 billion. The downfall stems from doubts about Facebook's ability to fend off intensifying competition from Internet search leader Google Inc. while trying to develop a plan for increasing the amount of revenue that it brings in from a worldwide audience of 955 million users. The uncertainty means Facebook's stock is likely to be volatile until the end of the year when the majority of the lockups expire. Hamadeh views the end of those selling constraints as a ""dark cloud on the horizon."" ""There is no way around it. It'll be painful,"" he said. ""But hopefully once that selling pressure is gone, it will find its floor and could be a basis for a more stable stock through 2013."" __ AP Business Writer Bernard Condon in New York contributed to this story.

At its peak, the stock traded at nearly $600, versus around $500 now. With earnings expected after the close Thursday, investors will be looking for any sign that the mounting controversy and legal issues over the injuries and deaths allegedly related to da Vinci procedures are affecting the company's growth. (Read More Below the Video.) : What Happens When the Surgical Robot Malfunctions? ) Over the past two quarters, growth in sales and profits slowed considerably, but it is still robust by most standards, with sales in the fourth quarter leaping 23 percent. Driving gains has been growing use of the da Vinci for hysterectomies and other gynecological procedures. Forecasts for this quarter are for earnings per share of 43 cents on revenue of $282 million. But as more reports of complications have come to light, the da Vinci debate is heating up. In late February, the FDA launched a probe calling for voluntary information from hospitals and surgeons using the da Vinci, in an effort to determine ""if the rise in reports may be a true reflection of problems."" Speaking at an investor meeting in early March, the company said, ""The relationship we have with the FDA has been a long and very strong relationship."" In mid-March the American Congress of Obstetricians and and Gynecologists issued a statement, warning that ""studies show there is a learning curve with new surgical technologies, during which there is an increased complication rate."" Robotic Surgery: Growing Sales, but Growing Concerns ) And five days later, the Massachusetts Board of Registration in Medicine weighed in with an advisory citing an ""increasing number of reports of patient complications associated with robot-assisted surgery."" In a statement to CNBC, Intuitive said: ""In any definitive treatment for complex disease, such as surgery of the cancerous prostate, heart, or other major organs there are risks of complications. Robotic surgery has proven benefits in reducing the risk and complications associated with open surgical procedures thereby extending the benefits of minimally invasive surgery to a broader population of patients. Overall, adverse event rates are very low. Da Vinci surgery has been shown to be safer than the open surgery alternatives in numerous independent large scale, peer reviewed studies.""
