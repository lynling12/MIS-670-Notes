"ETC: These are the overloaded cars of South Korean workers fleeing North Korea Filed under: Government/Legal , South Korea Around 175 South Korean workers have been forced to pack up their belongings and leave a group of jointly operated factories in North Korea after tensions continued to escalate between the two countries. The workers piled tools and finished products high onto the roofs of regular passenger cars as they evacuated as quickly as possible. North Korea says the ongoing talks with its southern neighbor geared toward keeping the factory complex operational were ""deceptive"" given that the US and South Korean armed forces continue to practice joint drills nearby. South Korea , meanwhile, was concerned that workers could be deprived of food or medicine if the situation continued to sour. The evacuation has placed the future of factories operated jointly by the two countries into question and marks the most significant casualty of the continued degradation of relations between the neighbors.

"Official: Chrysler investing $20M in Toledo plant to support 9-speed auto production Filed under: Plants/Manufacturing , Chrysler , Dodge , Jeep In 2011, Chrysler announced a $72-million investment in its Toledo Machining Plant to modernize production of the eight- and nine-speed torque-converters for automatic transmissions made there. That upgrade work won't be finished until Q3 of this year, but Chrysler has already announced a further $19.6-million investment to increase production capacity for the nine-speeders. The extra units will be necessary because the nine-speed transmission they'll be mated to is going into three popular models: it will debut on the 2014 Jeep Cherokee , then go into the Chrysler 200 and Dodge Dart . The company predicted that this year alone it would sell 200,000 units equipped with the nine-speed tranny, and it is spending some $374 million in addition to the investment in Toledo to upgrade production capacity for it. The work attached to this new investment won't begin until Q3 of 2014, and it will be finished by the end of that year. There's a press release below with all the details.

Related Gallery 2014 Jeep Cherokee Trailhawk: New York 2013 Chrysler Group Plans to Invest Nearly $20 Million in Toledo Machining Plant - Investment to increase capacity for production of torque converters for new generation, fuel-efficient nine-speed transmission - Company's total investment in U.S. facilities over $5.2 billion since June 2009 April 26, 2013 , Auburn Hills, Mich. - Chrysler Group LLC announced today that it will invest $19.6 million in its Toledo Machining Plant in Perrysburg, Ohio, to increase capacity of the torque converter it's machining for the nine-speed transmission. With this announcement, the Company's total investments in its U.S. operations since June 2009 increase to over $5.2 billion. The new torque converters will be paired with the next generation, fuel efficient nine-speed front-wheel drive transmission being assembled at Chrysler Group's Indiana (Kokomo, Ind.) Transmission Plant I. The new transmission will debut in the 2014 Jeep® Cherokee. ""The new nine-speed transmission is a critical part of our strategy to meet fuel economy requirements over the next several years and Toledo Machining will play an integral role in bringing this transmission to market,"" said Scott Garberding, Senior Vice President, Manufacturing, Chrysler Group LLC. ""Securing this additional investment is a testament to the dedication and commitment of the plant's workforce and helps secure its future long-term."" The investment will fund the installation of new equipment and tooling for additional machining and assembly capacity. Installation is expected to begin in the third quarter of 2014 and will be completed by the end of 2014. In August 2011, a $72 million investment in Toledo Machining was announced to modernize the plant to produce the eight- and nine-speed torque converters on two new production lines and a new steering column for the Dodge Dart and Jeep Cherokee. These installations will be complete in the third quarter this year. ""We're very pleased that Chrysler is once again investing in the Toledo Machining Plant and the skilled workforce there,"" said General Holiefield, Vice President and Director, UAW Chrysler Department. ""This will help preserve and enhance jobs in the area and give a greater measure of security to our members and their families well into the future."" In February, the Company announced that it was investing $374 million in several of its Kokomo, Ind., facilities, including establishing a new manufacturing site in Tipton, Ind., to increase production capacity of the nine-speed transmission. Toledo Machining currently produces torque converters for Kokomo Transmission (Ind.), Indiana Transmission I and II (Kokomo, Ind.), Sterling Heights Assembly (Mich.), and Toluca (Mex.). The plant also produces steering columns for the following assembly plants: Warren Truck (Mich.), Belvidere (Ill.), Sterling Heights (Mich.), Toledo Assembly Complex (Ohio); Windsor (Ont.), Toluca (Mex.), Saltillo (Mex.), Arab American Vehicles (Egypt) and Carabobo (Venezuela).

Last year, Akerson saw his pay jump by 44 percent to $11.1 million, including $1.99 million in restricted stock as salary units, which vest immediately.

"Report: Boston bombers were tracked using Mercedes mbrace [w/video] Filed under: Performance , Government/Legal , Technology , Mercedes-Benz , Luxury We now know Tamerlan and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, the two brothers said to be behind the Boston Marathon bombings, planned to head for New York City to detonate more improvised explosive devices. As it turns out, that plan was foiled by the quick thinking of one Mercedes-Benz owner, diligent police work and the Mercedes-Benz mbrace system. When the brothers carjacked a 26-year-old Chinese entrepreneur identified only as ""Danny,"" they didn't realize his Mercedes-Benz M-Class was equipped with the mbrace system, which can call for help in the event of an accident or track the vehicle in the event of a theft. According to reports, the Tsarnaev brothers held Danny hostage for nearly 90 minutes while they drove around Boston forming a plan until they had to stop for fuel. When one of the brothers went inside to pay, the other put his gun down for a moment. Danny took the opportunity to unlatch his seat belt, open the door and run to another nearby gas station, where he told the owner to call the police. When police arrived, they used the mbrace system to track the SUV after receiving Danny's permission, and it wasn't long before a shootout between police and the brothers ensued. When it was over, the eldest brother lay dead in the street. For more on the story, view the video report available below .

Until we stop all immigration from Muslim countries, events like this will continue to happen daily. Of course, the communists (liberals) like Obama fully support these scumbags. These people, combined with the 47% urban leeches, are the Democratic voting base. The growing threat of Islam is coming from within, and if we don't put a stop to it, soon we will find ourselves under a communist Marxist Islamic Jihadist rule (which is Obama's plan) soon. The Democrats have always been the party which supports extremist Islam. The fact that they ended the Iraq war (hich we began against an extremist Muslim dictator who supported the 9/11 terrorists who planned to use WMDs on America) proves that they support this communist Islamic agenda. They also HATE Israel, and want to wipe it and it's people off the map, andreplace it with ""Palestine"". They have the audacity to support a MOSQUE at ground 0, and now they are whining about the ""Miranda rights"" of this terrorist. Until we vote for a REAL conservative like Bachmann, Santorum, Rubio, or West, America will continue to die and be replaced by a communist Muslim stye.

Teaching them the finer points of the drive-by shooting probably shouldn't be one of them. That didn't stop 43-year-old Susan Becker piling her two teenage children into a car along with another teenage friend, arming the lot with pellet and BB guns and encouraging her posse to fire on parked cars. Becker bought the toys for her 13-year-old son and 15-year-old daughter, and a 15-year-old friend tagged along for the ride. All told, the team damaged at least 60 cars in and around Long Island as they fired from Becker's minivan. Police received reports from Islandia, Hauppauge and Commack communities, and some residents reported their windows smashed. Law enforcement used surveillance video to identify Becker's minivan and arrested the woman for multiple crimes, including endangering the welfare of a child and criminal mischief.

The new car's revelation at the 2013 Monaco F1 Grand Prix will be followed by a series of other dynamic demonstrations at events such as July's Festival of Speed at Goodwood, England.
