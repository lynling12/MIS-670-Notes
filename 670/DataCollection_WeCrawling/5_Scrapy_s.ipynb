We are always defending our own. It shows that we are a family.\"He added: \"I defend my team-mates as if they were my family and I am with them until the end.\"With the quality he has, things will be going well for him one day.\"Bale has scored only one goal in six games for Madrid this season.Manager Zinedine Zidane said: \"I did not listen to the whistles, only the applause.\"Swansea manager Paul Clement, the former assistant boss at Madrid, said Bale can cope with the boos and emerge a better player.\"That is a club where you need a lot of character,\" Clement said.\"Claude Makelele says it is the club you need the most mental toughness, because of how demanding the home crowd are.\"Gareth is not the first top player and he won\\'t be the last to be booed by the Madrid fans.\"Cristiano Ronaldo has had it, the Brazilian Ronaldo has had it, Zidane, [Luis] Figo. That is the reality of playing for that club.\"Coming through the other side of it makes you a better player, absolutely.\"Some are not able to cope with it, but the real top ones do and they become legends at the club and Gareth can do that.

He has made two appearances this campaign, the second from the bench in last England midfielder Wilshere may also feature on Thursday, for what would be his first Arsenal appearance in more than a year.He spent last season on loan at Bournemouth, making 27 appearances for the Cherries  - the latest in a long line of injuries - against Tottenham in April.French striker Olivier Giroud is another player likely to start Thursday\\'s game, having come off the bench in all of the Gunners\\' matches so far this season.The 30-year-old has scored 99 goals for the club, but has fallen behind new signing Alexandre Lacazette and Danny Welbeck in the attacking pecking order. And he revealed he came close to leaving the club this summer.\"It\\'s true that I was close to leaving the club because I said that I wanted to play,\" he said.\"But after a big reflection with everybody around me, like my family and my close friends, I decided I wanted to stay at Arsenal and I thought the story was not over, not finished at Arsenal.\"The club bring me a lot and I think I give it back. I still want to improve again and again and win some more trophies for the club, so as I said to the boss our story is not finished, so everybody was pleased with that.\"Arsenal face a tough test in the Premier League on Sunday when they travel to champions Chelsea.Wenger, though, is not using the weekend\\'s fixture as an excuse for an under-par display in Europe three days beforehand.\"It is a good opportunity to show we can cope,\" Wenger said. \"We played on Wednesday night in Barcelona and  [in the 2015-16 season]. It is a preconceived idea, football is down to how you perform on the day. Three days is plenty of time to recover.\"Arsenal have made a poor start to the campaign, losing twice in their opening four league games, but showed signs of recovery in the 3-0 win over Bournemouth last weekend.Koln are bottom of the Bundesliga, having lost all three of their opening league matches.']]"
