0,This airline that appears struggling just many fronts There something wrong with the culture There little attention paid staff and shows the indifferent verging rude service delivered cabin crew and customer service personnel They just don seem care They have invested new aircraft they needed their fleet still old However even newer aircraft breakdown this one did You can criticise them for this happens the best carriers However how these issues are handled important measure customer service For American the handling those merely highlighted the significant cultural disconnect Jaded staff give jaded service and did show
1,recently flew with American Airlines Business First Class Japan booked flight months ahead and about month before they called and said the flight had booked was cancelled and they needed rebook different time and Dallas instead Chicago The agent was little rude because was not happy that now would have instead She actually said you mean tell you don want get early also meant had change reservations for hotels because the timing was not thrilled The first leg dallas was Then connected Japan Air can say enough good things about them Such nice accommodating staff clean and pleasant great attitudes best flying experience ever had the bathroom there was hand written note saying thank you for flying with them and ask needed anything There was always moist towelettes and toothbrushes available and mouthwash too The return was all American Airlines asked attendant for help putting carryon and she said way can help you Not but will get you help Finally male staff member helped The rudeness continued when asked how put the sound for the movie You have wait she did big favor help Then when wanted change may food requested vegan due allergy but found out was gonna have cheese wanted switch Japanese food First she said then she said she would see she had enough Finally she said she could and told how lucky was that she could noticed she was super sweet the cute guy who sat behind calling him darling and sweety neveer said him for anything paid lot money for this trip and expected more
2,The worst ever experienced truly terrible frequent flyer who travels mostly out the far east using variety Arabian carriers all who left highly impressed when came flying home from the USA had some basic expectations what good service standard would But wow American Airlines how bad service commitment could you show the plane was actually very modern but the seats were truly terrible very narrow where near wide enough for your average person sit comfortably rock hard cushions with almost leg room and non removable armrest set low that stuck painfully into hip for the whole trip Half way home due this very poor seating legs had gone numb and was suffering terrible hip pains requested help from hostess who answer amazed when she stated Its economy deal with Sadly she was not the only staff member who seemed think rudeness was acceptable practice our flight there was quite large number people from religious group was obvious that one hostess did not like these poor people and constantly treated them rudely and was very intolerant towards their children thought American Airlines flag carrier but can only describe its staff showing pride this all they were scruffy with untied hair and poor dress code quality One male staff member with his crumpled shirt constantly hanging out and his underarm sweating very obvious when fellow passenger suggested tidy himself just aggressively stated working here Overall can only describe this the worst flight ever been left both myself and wife feeling very disappointed and myself still recovering from very painful hip days later advice would look elsewhere
3,normally don give reviews public forems However making this exception don want this happen anyone else flight Saint Kitts for study experienced sever weather conditions that lead delay arrival destination This compliant one sure many people will make with many airlines but aid was appalled with how they handled this service First understand that weather cannot avoided and not the fault the airline not their fault that they were unable land airport due the weather conditions that flew around the air for over two hours then stopping for gas another airport until finally reached destination not their fault that missed connecting flight due the delay However unreasonable ask pay for hotel because not their policy compensate for weather related conditions After spending flight was forced spend additional hotel room and arrive late destination When taking compliant customer service was given generic answer which they misspelled name know that bucks isn lot money for most people Howeve student budget and ever single dollar accounted for well ever single hour time planned Not only did they disregard financial constraints but also time didn complain that had wait additional day get destination made arrangements with school have the issue resolved share this experience with any traveler emergent situation Don travel with American Airlines you expect fair treatment weather related conditions Don expect any reimbursements either
4,This flight restored faith American Airlines After long day travel delays this flight was the most pleasant flight had years The flight attendants were the best encountered quite some time The perfect mix professional fun Thank you Heather Ernest nice looked the eye treated kindly made feel like they actually want make your experience good one After many years only using when they were the only option largely because customer service end flight that wins heart back Great job Heather Ernest
5,had issues with American before and vowed would never fly them again After over years decided give them one more chance That chance was undeserved They disappointed yet again used points buy first class flight splurge while vacation chose specific flight since was meeting family Tampa and were renting car together received communication about the flight and decided call check was that time that found out flight had been cancelled and rescheduled Apparently the flight crew needed rest called into reservations and was told that convenient morning flight has been changed flight The worst part that the agent made seem like they were doing favor told her the new flight didn work was then downgraded regular class earlier flight with option getting refunded asked the woman the phone double check there was first class seats available the flight course later came found out seats were available but the agent was too lazy check Everything has done online after the fact with guarantee resolution tried contact American once came home but they didn even try fix their complete lack customer service There was real attempt remedy the situation the people are not friendly and the savings are not worth the hassle return flight went without glitch Unfortunately based this experience and previous experiences just wont flying with American anymore
6,American Airlines customer service absolutely horrible They not care about their clients and lack communication between workers the plane and those inside flight was from Madrid Philadelphia and Philadelphia Memphis They cancelled the Philadelphia Madrid flight they sent from Philadelphia Chicago and Chicago Memphis The flight Memphis had left minutes after landed was impossible try and catch the flight when there wasn ample time make Then once talked the representative smiling the funniest thing that have wait til the next morning for flight and basically sleep the airport compensation for their disorganized system They put their customers can deal with American Airlines anymore None their workers were nice all They didn greet you anything Didn apologize anything

105,People pay for first class for reason Good food comfortable seats good service beverages etc and also the use bathrooms first class Every time husband wanted use the bathroom had stand line and the people front were people from coach The pilot even announced before the flight took off that everyone was use the restroom their class This happened flights days

108,ticket agent dismissive and rude trip sustained fall and was hospitalized with fracture the spine and disc herniation spine asked could purchase aisle seat that computer showed available explained the reason and showed hospital discharge summary She told she doubted could have the seat they were saved for families could sit together were about board she came over and told she decided could have Customer next stated see your seat also depends this woman ego Flight attendants are better always decline beverage because they are intimidating and rude God help you you need anything from them
109,recently flew Business class American Airlines and was shocked how bad the overall service was for the ticket price just very thankful that employer paid for the ticket paid would feel robbed
110,Paid check two bags Lucia through Houston Can tell you how shocked was find out that would have retrieve bags Miami and recheck basically gate check which typically FREE When asked for bags and money back could gate check was told and should have asked the kiosk lady before paid check bags This even makes United look good
111,have flown four times two years and every time they overbooked insane amount people and ultimately cancelled three flights All times they rerouted left stuck city six hours from destination Philly both times and had absolutely nothing worthwhile assist had cancel entire days work and school four occasipns because their poor travel accomodations The customer service team gave this awesome coupon for hotel stay which hilarious because the hotel business partner the airport wasn even like they were trying considerate These flights are cheap and uncomfortable and not worth never use airports again thanks their poor service just not worth the money and the risk

113,Evidently our Visa cards had the new chip which their kiosk couldn recognize
114,Time was getting very short and now there were other passengers with the same problem all tried our cards again During the process trying sixth time were told was too late and were denied boarding
115,will never fly this airline again When got the airport announcement was made that flights were over booked Minnesota was sure someone else would dragged off the flight Then after being called board own flight was sent back into the lobby and was told the flight was cancelled Cancelled flight due loose crew Although was upset didn lose The problem had was watched another woman book flight another airline all together and American Airline honored and paid for When asked for the same treatment customer service the same lady told she was unable honor that They called security because was upset and didn want leave the line until issue was resolved left and went out the front desk resolve issue and nothing helped only have back through TSA stuck the airport until after getting home and wont get home until tonight That the flight doesn get cancelled again Rude hell extremely unhelpful asshole customer service and airline

162,EDITORS COMMENT seems crazy fly back airport that far from your destination but this decision generally has with crew and aircraft bases you went another airport there may not have been enough spare crew therefore your flight would delayed more than what was due mandatory rest periods Any delay due weather means the airline not liable anything for the passenger unless they choose This the case with all airlines and unfortunately you would probably have found the same inconvenience and out pocket expenses with all the airlines the know this doesn change the fact that you lost precious holiday time which beyond frustrating but hopefully helps answer why things happened the way they did
163,use American Airlines for lot trips Every time have with the utmost respect The staff was beyond friendly They gave son daughter and even daughter teddy bear little American Airlines badge The food was good and the seat could been improved little more Overall have had great experiences with American Airlines
164,Palm Springs Greenville and return

191,high prices delays and sleeping airports your thing all means with American Ironically there nothing more American than American Airlines
192,Horrible This airline will not allow print your boarding pass without seat But then airline freezes the seats hours before the flight can get seat This forces the kiosk counter instead going straight security Somehow other airlines have the technology this app failed tell that the flight was delayed They oversold the flight and needed volunteers The compensation for volunteering your seat was horrible Thus family with young kids got kicked off the flight After the hour delay the woman announcing the boarding would not use the microphone which was reach one could hear her and she made everyone feel like they were the problem They made check our bags starting with zone three yet several overheads were empty anyone asked question voiced concern the attendants the gate were rude and obnoxious back The attendants called for supervisor help and then wasted time complaining her than just doing thei job Fix your staff and your pathetic company policies and systems have seen other airlines handle worse situations with professionalism Grade for

330,husband daughter and travelled LAX and from Sydney recently were extremely satisfied with the customer service this airline right from the get They were all friendly and very helpful definitely flying with you again
331,The flight from lucia miami was delayed for hours due mechanical problems Not enjoyable but understandable what was unacceptable was americans treatment all the impacted passengers were either completely ignored for hours when the employees would talk were lied about when the flight will take off the fact that there would hotel accomodations none after they said everyone would get one they said ticket agents would ready and waiting when got miami wait hour for the ticket booths open and get line behind everyone else Every one the employees was dismissive and rude

333,Flew American from Denver Charlotte February Seats had more legroom and width than any other domestic carrier flown the last year Crew was friendly and helpful thinking switching American whenever can
334,Worst Airline Ever been waiting for this day for very very long time was excited started packing weeks advanced And this morning woke and when got the airport thought will smooth flight but turns out FLIGHT WAS CANCELED PUERTO RICO had connection flight From New York Kitts Puerto Rico But then PUERTO RICO CONNECTION FLIGHT WAS CANCELED TOO And had catch cruise And all the staff ignored Please don take American Airlines Save your money
335,Paid for priority boarding and upgraded seat Did get seat until after everyone boarder Mived the gate min before the flight
336,Worst experience have had flying
337,not surprised see such low ratings for American paid for first class upgrade check for flight March but should have saved money Service waa the slowest ever experienced coach class Took minutes get drink and nuts and was the row Now today check bag and seat has been relocated from row the back the plane Best they can now exit row Called American complain and nothing they can fly often and fly Alaska Delta and American avoid American the future Alaska service and attitude their employees blows American away every day every flight
338,never been hassled for carry Took three flights all the same size planes and carry fit just fine Get last flight and they half ass measured and claimed wouldn fit saw people with bigger bags make onto the aircraft and put their luggage the overhead bins with problem This HUGE inconvenience because bag the standard carry size and has NEVER had problem fitting this ridiculous Now not only have wait for carry the carousel further delaying commute home but also praying that the breakables suitcase don get destroyed after being tossed around Thanks American Airlines will NOT flying again
339,The customer service with this company horrible first flight with them left time and then arrived early but stayed the runway for mins after landing Then get connecting flight and they tell they have given seat away because wasn there mins AFTER they started boarding the flight was time for flight and got there before flight was suppose take off and before their minutes before they are suppose suppose the doors When got their help desk they told would have put stand for the next other flights along with other people because there are other seats available any other flight Then they have the nerve trying get pay more get another flight that wasn even close destination and with word would get stuck the airport they would sending either Now missing work for who knows how long because they don even follow what they have printed their fine print every ticket
340,American Airlines changed the size the plane are taking for our vacation The new plane smaller and now family longer has assigned seats yet every one else the plane has assigned seats and there are only random single seats available through out the plane American response was that this happens sometimes and all can the website daily see someone cancels their trip and can take their seats The kicker that the airline rep said that since kids are yrs old and under when get the airport they will have rearrange seating allow board since the kids cannot sit themselves This absurd practice since will only cause confusion and anger the airport American should proactive and resolve this situation ahead time will never fly American again and will telling everyone know about this
341,Heartless
342,admit messed the booking first But called within hour change the flight most airlines forgive this you quickly enough and the flight not processed They did Fine The problem the lady the phone booked the wrong day for flight
343,call again fix this the next day when caught the problem The flight need for tomorrow They said they longer have seats and that there nothing they can Nor will they compensate nor will they refund ticket even though they made mistake and because the time lost booking the wrong flight that can make the flight actually needed
344,Normally would mad but beyond distraught now because that flight see aunt Texas who literally dying because they found lymphoma her bone marrow the other day and she will likely her way out any moment
345,Never book with American Airlines They have some the worst policies have ever encountered had round trip flight booked but due unforeseen circumstances ended only needed take the returning flight Yet only take the returning flight and cancel the departing flight would cost DOLLARS between the cancellation fees and change fees Furthermore cancelled both flights they would credit account yet access that credit would cost and additional DOLLARS out pocket change flights Lastly were simply not show for departing flight hopes only taking the return flight that would void return flight entirely Overall booking with American Airlines has proved horrible experience their policies are unfair unbudging and unhelpful the customer not book with them you hope have positive experience
346,EDITORS COMMENT This global policy that all airlines use you are flying the cheapest non flexible fare This definitely not unique this airline the USA
347,flew out Des Moines March standby knew was spring break and would challenge get out had ladies named Angela Frey and Lindsey Elder everything they could get They were wonderful and very polite They had very good attitude and worked with all the passengers very professional Anytime anyone had question they had Answer They made everyone feel comfortable
348,very comfortable business class seating The service and food needs lots work found the staff very rude and unhelpful The lounge experience Australia was great was qantas facilities The lounge was poor and dirty
349,Connecting Flight cancellation Full fare first class seat sold out from under with notification even though was the gate hours prior boarding assistance rebooking cancelled connecting flight Lost bags routed different airports
350,Took hours get from Dallas Cleveland normally hour flight
351,lost wallet with corporate credit card flight from Savannah International JFK Three days later received message work number from rep who said had wallet also requested LinkedIn had read company name the credit card and sought out with that kept the ticket counter and was able express Fedex back Philadelphia where work was polite and welcoming the entire time Also bought round trip plane ticket Savannah about week advance and was still pretty cheap Very satisfied
352,will never fly American Airlines again waited for hour the gate let off the plane Many people flight missed their connection connecting flight someone scratched leather backpack from Florence flew over six hours Honolulu and you had pay for meals the flight Really much paid for ticket This airline complete joke and will never fly with them again
353,EDITORS COMMENT Yep they charge you for meals most the other airlines fair though
354,Don ever fly AMERICAN AIRLINES They cancel your next day flights and wait until late night after you bed asleep let you know Then the flight you rebooked shows late therefore missing your connecting flights then you get rebooked for the next day missing whatever event you were supposed attend that day you the terminal bright and REALLY EARLY catch your rebooked flight the counter workers get work late not time make the two hour prior rule once again especially when they tell you there TWO hours prior and you only have minutes left get through security and catch your plane Then when you get ready board they double book seats and now you have wait again for the next flight therefore missing all your connecting flights Then after you FINALLY get flight your flight attendants act like prison guards course your flight arrives with less than minutes catch your next flight you have run like sprinter hopefully catch your next flight American Airlines you truly have issues
355,There doubt that american carriers general lag behind their European Middle Eastern and Asian counterparts anything from service equipment entertainment
356,recent flight came new low least far entertainment concerned The available selection and more the interface something would have expected see but certainly not The movie selection was minuscule even compared carriers such United
357,The New release selection was comprised handful features and most them weren even that new The oddest thing and the main reason compare technology that the features are not demand they have cycle and you have either watch what progress wait for the next feature start honestly haven seen this since this since the era
358,The food general mediocre but since flight originated London probably better than had started trip Miami Generally speaking find that the quality food carriers better coming out Europe rather than arriving into
359,Will never fly this airline again booked round trip Bahamas and had make change return date Their change fee excessive More than the value the return flight was changing credit tickets have absolutely worthless
360,Absolute WORST airline the industry American airlines does NOT care about their customers the least Once you book flight with them and they get your money than you can just forget about receiving ANY customer service after that American states LARGE print they want their customers satisfied with their experience flying with American but that simply NOT true Upon writing American several times work out resolution issue that American was responsible for American only responded with automated cut and paste mail with generic babble that they filter out all customers who have been decieved American You can forget about calling them they make you can call resolve issues but only through pony express mail which you will only receive the typical cut and paste response basically stating tough luck After record breaking profit BILLION dollars that American profited the last quarter they STILL refuse compensate their customers for error their behalf The worst airline the industry UNDERstatement and thee most unethical EVER witnessed lifetime
361,The aircrafts are REALLY OLD and the milege program THE WORST THE WORLD
362,Trash this airline absolutley the worst delayed two seperate flights that had multiple times wasted entire day the airport and person part the shitty staff could answer and questions Never ever flying again they shouldnt even allowed opperate currently still sitting the airport writing this review flight has been delayed two more times Absolutley Unacceptable
363,Horrible Rude staff boarding our flight cousin was helping with carry bag when were rudely separated the front the plane and told that cousin could ahead but must wait for the passengers the pointy end served beverages aware that those who can afford the extra cost sit front probably deserve priority but doesn mean that those use who fly cattle class deserve treated cattle When made the row our seats asked cousin stand and put small bag into the overhead locker The very rude flight attendant then yelled yes yelled sit down and allow others proceed their seats She was clearly aware what caused the delay getting seat Appalling totally appalling Qantas you made mistake when you partnered with American Airlines
364,was depart today Flight was delayed told mechanical problem new departure time But first had different gate gates away But then that was the steak after went gates away they told back the original gate Handed out lunch vouchers use airport for lunch One person handing them out people Stood line for one hour get Voucher Now sitting the plane Plane has still not taken off Apparently they can find the copilot This airline composed the the biggest bunch incompetent individuals who not have ANY sense urgency clue about customer service will never take this airline again
365,Rude unhelpful staff flight was delayed til morning and they did not offer hotel They said all our hotels are booked you get one you can send your receipt for refund Really ended sleeping the airport until morning when flight was delayed again for short time one communicated with properly and did not feel that American cared all will not flying with American again
366,flight was delayed Toronto therefore missed connecting flight Atlanta member staff appeared care that this misfortune was not fault but the fault the airline asked for nothing Simply for staff show some way that they cared could taken the form concerned question maybe beverage whilst you wait etc will all means avoid using American all future trips The market too competitive for this complacency
367,was flight and the flight was delayed missed our next flight and were stuck innthe aiport Philly ALL DAY The staff was absolutley horrid would NEVER reccomend this ANYONE there was zero rating they recieve The flight attendents told some parents that they got handle their kids lives maybe their kids would little better bahaved when the kids were not doing anything extreme Horrible flight horrible attendents
368,Never repeat NEVER fly with Three flights had small maintenance problems which led hour delay flight hour delay the second flight and hour delay and then cancellation last flight Not only are the American Eagle jets constantly breaking but the employees leave you the dark for the entire duration the delay They wont inform you what going and they constantly tell you its going about more minutes They give you voucher for pos hotel and dont tell you that the shuttle the hotel closed after certain time you can help would highly reccommend flying with anyone but
369,The worst experience life was offered voucher toward next trip absurd since the company caused over and precious time will NEVER travel using American Airlines for the rest life
370,This the most horrifying and terrible airline ever This was very first time flying and was terrible trip there and back was scheduled leave Friday from Jacksonville Florida and arrive Charlotte North Carolina however flight was extremely late and arrived later when finally got North Carolina flight from North Carolina Baton Rouge was cancelled had stay overnight North Carolina and missed very important event that was scheduled attend finally got Louisiana the next day When was departing from Baton Rouge flight again was extremely late leaving and while were still the air flight from North Carolina back Jacksonville Florida departed which resulted staying over night again North Carolina American Airlines will never get business again and will not recommend this airline anyone terrible
371,accountability flights flight was cancelled due weather yet other airline had cancellations flying same destination They will not reimburse for ANY expenses you incur due your flight being cancelled
372,Flights were time but the staff were rude both flights Not helpful all
373,there was star rating would give flight was delayed and was not compensated The support staff was lazy and more interested gossiping than helping customers with schedule changes The attendent had not shred humility courtesy barking customers fasten their seat belts without much please Seats are tiny and dirty Hire service staff that understands what serving means Clean your planes And offer compensation ALL DELAYS more like Cathay Pacific
374,quite possibly the worst Airline you can stuck with say stuck
375,Completely unacceptable Every time fly American Airlines there are more problems than can count fly all over the world with various airlines and never have experienced what with last flight which had booked months advance visit home over Christmas holidays Madrid NYC Charlotte and return was quite bad was moved seats from the window the middle with other choice the did not work flight entertainment and bad customer service leave last option when booking flights and this why
376,were design customer service platform that had the mission making every person flying airline pissed off BEFORE boarding the plane would copy the model Seriously the worst airline have ever flown This compared budget travel airlines Southeast Asia Your rep are the most rude individuals have ever dealt with travel would JAL didn kick your ass their flight service

378,They refunded ticket due winter storm They cancelled the flight They will not refund seat upgrade phone calls emails refund
379,husband and paid extra for our seats and from Honolulu for our dream vacation These fees were that could sit together for the flights and for extra leg room never got the extra leg room any the flights and had argue with the counter people even get sit together
380,Worst service unacceptable NOT FLY WITH THEM YOU NOT HAVE Our flights had schedule change and were not notified addition when they rebooked onto another flight hrs later they did not give priority boarding preferred seats which paid for when made our reservations Reservation agents were rude and condescending the airport ticking reps REFUSED check pushed from person person even after demanding supervisor times Management never returned the call directed they would Due the schedule change our connection flight was changed and were given less than min land taxi change terminals and board before our next flight was depart Customer relations answered the complaint with generic email response stating they were sorry for the inconvenience and hoped would fly with them the future and then followed with phone call that told there nothing they can about the experience service lack products received and back online and file new complaint about the complaint
381,fly frequently from Maui Phoenix American Air direct flight Its always the same plane easily identifiable the condition the plane looks like East German Surplus Every surface looks like mix faded layers paint caulking dirt adhesive etc You can see signs repairs all over the plane interior and exterior While going the bathroom the service door behind the seat often falls open Not very confidence inspiring
382,Broke worn interiors was four different planes and All seat cushions were like towel tin plate Flight attendants were all worn out too Overcharged twice for seat selection they xtra charged cancelled flight and xtra charged Again the reschedule flight Sad experience fly American Airlines Nickel and dime robbers every turn one star rating for BFYCMT
383,American Airlines disappointment that just shame

386,These scoundrels would rather hold onto disabled person than handle customer service query with any sort professional dignity Calling back four weeks after made the complaint bad enough but immediately informing that you were not the wrong completely unacceptable broke leg shortly after booking flight with called Reservations request upgraded seats They made pay for seats both connecting flights but ultimately only received upgrade the first flight Even then there was actual legroom they just stuck the front row where could kicked the flight attendant the entire flight the second flight was completely ignored and not given what paid for Telling there record the account that was injured outrageous lie evil corporation This one first ever experiences American company and really makes question American integrity honest
387,Your airline sucks Ian leaving house get flight Miami fly Brazil just arrived backfr Germany hours earlier platinum executive with all your apps downloaded phone After sitting plane just been told that our crew just left Miami and will not there before which means missing connection How the century can you not send out email when you know there crew This not only very bad customer service but intention miss information wonder with whom you merge again when after the next years you are bankrupt again Your luck only that all the other Airlines are bad and can keep together either fly allot and Airline are the worst there You clearly world when comes flying
