0,"December 1, 2017",8/10,Economy Class,"The flight booking through my agent was a breeze and at a reasonable price. I just flew, November 27th, from Adelaide to Belgrade through Doha without any problems. The flying felt safe at all times in an A350 for the first leg and an A321 for the second leg. The flight crew were very attentive, polite, obliging to requests, and efficient. There were no problems with the baggage. The planes were clean although the seats were a little on the squeeze side in the economy section. The only critique could be directed towards the quality of food: it did not look inviting nor it tasted pleasantly, an area that would require quite a considerable improvement. On the brighter side, there was more than enough food on offer and frequently so. The entertainment was of satisfactory quality with a wide range of choices. I flew with Qatar before and always found it worth speaking well of. I will be having the return flight in a few months time and will voice myself again then.",Yes,4,2,5,4,4
1,"November 27, 2017",2/10,Economy Class,"I would not recommend Qatar Airways to any Australian travelling internationally. Their customer service team couldn’t care less about the well-being of Australians. After missing a connecting flight in Doha from Melbourne by 10 minutes, I was forced to stay in Doha overnight, and subsequently arrived 28 hours late to my destination. I was told by every single flight attendant and the Melbourne ground staff that we would arrive on time, and that the DOH->SKP flight would be delayed for us so “I have nothing to worry about”. If they had just been honest and told me that it will be late, I could have told my partner to cancel and we would have gotten our money back. However, as a result we lost over $400 AUD in money. I absolutely DO NOT recommend flying with Qatar Airways to any Australian. When things go wrong, as they often do (just have a read online of all the complaints) they have the worst customer service I have ever witnessed in my life. I am scarred by this experience and hope that once I am back in Melbourne I never have to fly with Qatar Airways ever again. I think that Qatar Airways should be absolutely ashamed of the service, stress and trauma you have caused me. So please, save yourself the stress – Fly Etihad or Emirates, DO NOT FLY WITH QATAR!",No,3,3,1,3,3

In flight entertainment was awesome I was able to watch all of the Big, Little Eyes series.

Stood in line for 3 hours only to be turned away. No explanation or apology. Just a complete absence of any communication. Returned 9 hours later at 3:30am, stood in check-in line for another 2 hours. Had to spend $480 on taxi fares. Arrived in Doha, delay meant we missed our connecting flight so we had to spend a day in Qatar. Waited in line for another hour while accommodation was arranged (couldn’t this have been done while we were in the air? Didn’t they know this would need to be organised?) Qatar put us up in the Best Western. This hotel at $60AUD per night is nightmarish slum. Told by guards not to leave the hotel. Finally arrive in Madrid 52 hours after leaving Sydney.

When trying to claim compensation as is my ‘guaranteed’ right by law under EU Regulation EC 261/2004, the customer care officer, Nabeel simply refused.

I understand that times can change however I did not receive one email or notification that my flight had been switched. If I hadn’t randomly checked my booking I would’ve missed my flight entirely. I have emailed customer service multiple times regarding this saying that I will not be in the departure city on the new departure day and will need alternative options. All I received was an apology and a statement telling me to contact my local customer support. I have called my local branch five times of which I have been put on hold for over 20 mins each time.  I have sent more emails to customer service and still waiting on a reply. It has gotten to the point where I am leaving in 2 weeks and had to adjust all my other plans resulting in high costs.

They had no options other than to eat Beef, since then ran out of chicken when still 30% off the passengers left to feed. They had no options for the beer, no wine at all due to Ramadan, they strip checked (pat downs) only the bachelors on suspicion (random), they did not check the families with children although they have chances of carrying dangerous goods or drugs in their children carry-ons. The airhostesses were not really friendly, they served cold drinks quietly, they did not wake up the passengers who were fast asleep when the food arrived, they had no sweetener such as splenda,. Air hostesses looked as if they are forced to do a job. The flights from IAH to DOH was old, dusty. The flat screens were very old, malfunctioning, touch screen was not working, seats were not reclining well. Too much to complain… not worth it at all. We flew Qatar airlines for the first time in 25 years. One of the worst airlines in the world. We tried almost all airlines in 25 years but our experience with Qatar airlines was the worst.

Made worse as we were treated abysmally by the staff at the airport and the hotel they stuck us in was vile. Dirty toilet, used sanitary towel in bin and whole room smelt of damp as water dripped off AC unit.  No food was left as restaurant closed 5 mins after we arrived and it was buffet style.

Starting with the checking in, security controls and boarding my impressions were very satisfying as everything went smoothly and efficiently at both airports. The crew were welcoming, smiling, courteous and helpful. The seating was comfortable enough in the A320 for the first leg of the trip, but more so and completely satisfying in the A350 during the second leg. The entertaining was of sufficient quality for my needs because I was immersed in my own private activities – reading, writing, photographing. etc… The main meals were served at appropriate lapses of time in sufficient, if not ample, quantities with snacks and drinks available for the asking in between their own frequent offering. The quality was very good and inviting upon looking at them (meals). The cabin crew were efficient in clearing the trays and the plane in general.

The plane’s crew were kind and attentive, relentlessly offering drinks and small snacks. As it was a night flight, the plane environment was silent while most of everyone were sleeping. The flight itself was very pleasant and gave the feeling of safety at all times. My baggage was securely transferred at Doha and easily picked up at Belgrade. The planes were an A350 and an A320. I can select two things of lesser satisfaction: the entertainment system needs considerable upgrade, and the food, although in sufficient quantities, did not look appetizing nor tempting to devour.

Meal service was very efficient but for the number of cabin crew that travelled on these flights, their presence outside of the meal service was very scarce. On long haul flights, you would think there would be more offers of water but this was not the case. Passengers often going to the galley in search of and then having to help themselves. Hygiene in the toilets was unfortunately poor. I realise this is mostly due to passengers but have been on a number of long haul flights this year and Qatar stands out in this area.

Qr-945 Bali to doha was in a 777. 300 in busines , what a nice trip , plane is very roomie up the pointie end. Service was excellant as we needed a wheelchair to meet us at at all departure & arrival points all turned up and pick us up at lounge for next flight. New hamed airport , wow , the long wait has been worth it , it is opulant to say the lease. Plenty of shops open. As the qatar business & first class lounge are not finished yet, we were met at bali arrivals with a letter from qatar say they would give us 10’000 points as compensation as they could not give us anywere ( lounge ) to stay for 3.15 hours. Very pore effort indeed. But every thing else in airport seems tobe running smooth. Qr-67 doha to frankfurt was non eventful with excellant service . The only problem is those darn a-330 planes very pore seats,( we know the problems ) .  Wil be returning qr- oo4 heathrow to doha 3rd july business on new a-380, so looking forward to that.

Doha airport was not to my expectations. The waiting place was cramped with less number of toilets to handle the crowd.

223,"June 3, 2014",3/10,Business,"Was refused boarding in Doha after the late arrival of my flight from Cape Town at the new Hamid airport, despite making it to the gate on time. “No time to transfer my luggage” was the reason given. To be fair, they took me to a hotel for the day and paid for my lunch but it was a 12 hour delay I could have done without and I missed meetings because of it. After arriving in KL 12 hours later than I expected to I stood and waited for my luggage…and waited…and waited. It has not arrived, which makes a total mockery of them bumping me off the flight in the first place (business class I might add). To top this woeful performance off, I have made at least 10 phone calls to try to track down my bag and not one person was able to assist. Either the phone isn’t answered or I’m given another number to call. Meanwhile I am trying to prepare for a trip to Europe in two days without many of the things I need to take with me.",No,4,3,3,3,3

As for the flight itself, the metal is OK but the business class cabin in the Dreamliner is cramped if you’re tall like me; try turning over when in bed mode and you will see what I mean.  Give me the business class cabin of an Emirates A380 any day. The cabin crew are hit and miss; either gruff or unsure of themselves with a few exceptions. Normally the best are in business class cabins, but not on QR. All in all, not a pleasant experience and I will return to Emirates once they get their flight schedule back in order.
