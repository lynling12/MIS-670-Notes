0,"November 10, 2017",1/10,Flew First Class,"This is an airline that appears to be struggling on just so many fronts. There is something wrong with the culture. There is little attention paid to staff and it shows in the indifferent, verging on rude service delivered by by cabin crew and customer service personnel. They just don’t seem to care. They have invested in new aircraft, they needed to as their fleet is still old. However, even newer aircraft breakdown as this one did. You can’t criticise them for this, it happens to the best of carriers. However, how these issues are handled is an important measure of customer service. For American the handling of those merely highlighted the significant cultural disconnect. Jaded staff give jaded service, and did it show.",No,width: 40%,width: 60%,width: 20%,width: 40%,width: 40%
1,"November 4, 2017",5/10,Flew First Class,"I recently flew with American Airlines, Business/ First Class to Japan. I booked my flight months ahead, and about a month before they called me and said the flight I had booked was cancelled and they needed to rebook it at a different time and to Dallas instead of Chicago. The agent was a little rude because i was not happy that now I would have to go at 3am instead of 7am. She actually said “do you mean to tell me you don’t want to get up early?? It also meant i had to change reservations for hotels because of the timing so I was not thrilled.. The first leg to dallas was ok. Then it connected to Japan Air. I can’t say enough good things about them. Such a nice, accommodating staff. So clean and pleasant, great attitudes..best flying experience I ever had. In the bathroom there was a hand written note saying thank you for flying with them and to ask if we needed anything. There was always moist towelettes and toothbrushes available, and mouthwash too.The return was all American Airlines. I asked an attendant for help putting my carryon up and she said Oh No way.. I can’t help you.Not, no, but I will get you help. Finally a male staff member helped me. The rudeness continued when I asked how to put the sound on for the movie.”You have to wait”..she did me a big favor to help..Then when i wanted to change may food..I requested vegan due to allergy but I found out it was gonna have cheese so i wanted to switch to Japanese food..First she said no, then she said she would see if she had enough. Finally she said she could do it and told me how lucky I was that she could do it..I noticed she was super sweet to the cute guy who sat behind me, calling him darling and sweety..neveer said no to him for anything.I paid a lot of money for this trip and expected more.",No,width: 80%,width: 100%,width: 20%,width: 100%,width: 100%
2,"October 19, 2017",1/10,Flew Economy Class,"The worst I’ve ever experienced truly terrible I’m a frequent flyer who travels mostly out to the far east using a variety Arabian of carriers all of who left me highly impressed, so when it came to flying home from the USA I had some basic expectations of what a good service standard would be. But wow American Airlines how bad a service commitment could you show, the plane was actually very modern but the seats were truly terrible- very narrow no where near wide enough for your average person to sit in comfortably, rock hard cushions with almost no leg room and a non-removable armrest set so low that it stuck painfully into my hip for the whole trip. Half way home due to this very poor seating my legs had gone numb and I was suffering a terrible hip pains, I requested help from a hostess who’s answer amazed me when she stated “Its economy deal with it !!” Sadly she was not the only staff member who seemed to think rudeness was an acceptable practice, on our flight there was quite a large number of people from a religious group, it was so obvious that one hostess did not like these poor people and constantly treated them rudely and was very intolerant towards their children. I thought of American Airlines as a flag carrier but can only describe its staff showing as no pride in this at all, they were scruffy with untied hair and a poor dress code quality. One male staff member with his crumpled shirt constantly hanging out and his underarm sweating very obvious- when a fellow passenger suggested he tidy himself up he just aggressively stated “ I’m working here” Overall I can only describe this as the worst flight I’ve ever been on, it left both myself and my wife feeling very disappointed and myself still recovering from a very painful hip 2 days later. My advice would be look elsewhere!!",No,width: 60%,width: 20%,width: 20%,width: 80%,width: 80%
3,"September 9, 2017",1/10,Flew Economy Class,"I normally don’t give reviews on public forems. However, I am making this exception as I don’t want this to happen to anyone else. On my flight to Saint Kitts for study, ai experienced sever weather conditions that lead to a delay in my arrival at my destination. This compliant is one I am sure many people will make with many airlines, but aid was appalled with how they handled this service. First, I understand that weather cannot be avoided and is not the fault of the airline. It is not their fault that they were unable to land at my airport due to the weather conditions or that We flew around in the air for over two hours then stopping for gas at another airport until we finally reached my destination. It’s not their fault that I missed my connecting flight due to the delay. However, it is unreasonable to ask me to pay for a hotel because it is not their policy to compensate for weather related conditions. After spending $1690 on a flight I was forced to spend an additional 210 on a hotel room and arrive late at my destination. When taking my compliant to customer service, I was given a generic answer in which they misspelled my name. I know that 200 bucks isn’t a lot of money for most people. Howeve, I am a student on a budget and ever single dollar is accounted for as well is ever single hour of my time is planned. Not only did they disregard my financial constraints but also my time. I didn’t complain that I had to wait an additional day to get to my destination. I made arrangements with my school to have the issue resolved. I share this experience with any traveler in an emergent situation. Don’t travel with American Airlines if you expect fair treatment in weather related conditions. Don’t expect any reimbursements either.",No,width: 20%,width: 20%,width: 60%,width: 100%,width: 100%
4,"August 24, 2017",10/10,Flew Premium Economy Class,"This flight restored my faith in American Airlines. After a long day of travel & delays this flight was the most pleasant flight I’ve had in years! The flight attendants were the best I’ve encountered in quite some time!! The perfect mix of professional & fun! Thank you Heather & Ernest!! It’s nice to be looked in the eye, treated kindly & made to feel like they actually want to make your experience a good one! After many years of only using AA when they were the only option (largely because of customer service), I end up on a flight that wins my heart back. Great job Heather & Ernest!!",Yes,width: 80%,width: 100%,width: 100%,width: 0%,width: 0%
