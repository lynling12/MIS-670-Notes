0,"December 1, 2017",8/10,Flew Economy Class,"The flight booking through my agent was a breeze and at a reasonable price. I just flew, November 27th, from Adelaide to Belgrade through Doha without any problems. The flying felt safe at all times in an A350 for the first leg and an A321 for the second leg. The flight crew were very attentive, polite, obliging to requests, and efficient. There were no problems with the baggage. The planes were clean although the seats were a little on the squeeze side in the economy section. The only critique could be directed towards the quality of food: it did not look inviting nor it tasted pleasantly, an area that would require quite a considerable improvement. On the brighter side, there was more than enough food on offer and frequently so. The entertainment was of satisfactory quality with a wide range of choices. I flew with Qatar before and always found it worth speaking well of. I will be having the return flight in a few months time and will voice myself again then.",Yes,width: 80%,width: 40%,width: 100%,width: 80%,width: 80%
1,"November 27, 2017",2/10,Flew Economy Class,"I would not recommend Qatar Airways to any Australian travelling internationally. Their customer service team couldn’t care less about the well-being of Australians. After missing a connecting flight in Doha from Melbourne by 10 minutes, I was forced to stay in Doha overnight, and subsequently arrived 28 hours late to my destination. I was told by every single flight attendant and the Melbourne ground staff that we would arrive on time, and that the DOH->SKP flight would be delayed for us so “I have nothing to worry about”. If they had just been honest and told me that it will be late, I could have told my partner to cancel and we would have gotten our money back. However, as a result we lost over $400 AUD in money. I absolutely DO NOT recommend flying with Qatar Airways to any Australian. When things go wrong, as they often do (just have a read online of all the complaints) they have the worst customer service I have ever witnessed in my life. I am scarred by this experience and hope that once I am back in Melbourne I never have to fly with Qatar Airways ever again. I think that Qatar Airways should be absolutely ashamed of the service, stress and trauma you have caused me. So please, save yourself the stress – Fly Etihad or Emirates, DO NOT FLY WITH QATAR!",No,width: 60%,width: 60%,width: 20%,width: 60%,width: 60%

3,"October 4, 2017",10/10,Flew Economy Class,"Flew Economy NZ to Dublin through Doha. Asked at Doha airport for an upgrade on return flight and got it. In respect to ground/cabin crew first class treatment at all times. Liquids/food seemed to flow endlessly on this longest haul flights, the food was all yummy. In flight entertainment was awesome I was able to watch all of the Big, Little Eyes series. My partner and I requested emergency exit seats on all flights, we secured these and were not charged extra. We paid for access to business lounge at Doha and had an awesome shower. Highly recommend this airline and will fly with them again next year.",Yes,width: 100%,width: 100%,width: 100%,width: 100%,width: 100%
4,"September 30, 2017",1/10,Flew Economy Class,"Our flight from Sydney to Madrid was delayed by 9 hours. We were not informed until we arrived to check in. Stood in line for 3 hours only to be turned away. No explanation or apology. Just a complete absence of any communication. Returned 9 hours later at 3:30am, stood in check-in line for another 2 hours. Had to spend $480 on taxi fares. Arrived in Doha, delay meant we missed our connecting flight so we had to spend a day in Qatar. Waited in line for another hour while accommodation was arranged (couldn’t this have been done while we were in the air? Didn’t they know this would need to be organised?) Qatar put us up in the Best Western. This hotel at $60AUD per night is nightmarish slum. Told by guards not to leave the hotel. Finally arrive in Madrid 52 hours after leaving Sydney. I wanted my expenses to be reimbursed ie. Taxi fares and missed hotel accommodation in Madrid. Called Qatar’s customer help line. On hold for 40 minutes then hung up on. Twice. I’ve tried emailing too. Nope. No reply.",No,width: 20%,width: 80%,width: 20%,width: 100%,width: 100%
