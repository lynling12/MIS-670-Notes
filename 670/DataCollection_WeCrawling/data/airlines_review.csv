Heidi of Salem, OR," Nov. 14, 2017","I was on an almost 2 hour flight (Flight AA3936) stuck sitting with one leg over my bag and the other on the edge of the aisle. Not once was I asked to check in my bag nor told it wouldn't fit on the overhead bin. By the time we landed my knees, hips and back were killing me and I had to have help from the gentleman next to me to be able to stand up. So glad there wasn't an emergency 'cause this would have been one hell of a hazard. Lesson learned not to use this airline again."
Michael of Austin, TX," Nov. 11, 2017","American Airlines‰Û_the new standard for horrible service. Oh‰Û_I mean HORRIBLE! I travel very frequently for work and have stuck to one specific airline in order to build my status with them (ie. first class upgrades often, better seat choices, free checked bags). Recently, service has taken a turn for the worse. I‰Ûªm a reasonable guy and tolerate more than most. Call it my Southern hospitality, my upbringing or my service to the community when I served in law enforcement, but I just plain put up with more‰Û_until now."
Kevin of Framingham, MA," Nov. 9, 2017","I travel 80%~ for Work and have flown with almost every airline multiple times. AA is by far the worst. Not due to their customer service/staff/delays or anything like that (at least that I‰Ûªve noticed), but their planes have no entertainment system on each seat, they do not play movies on the overhead screens, and they don‰Ûªt even have a free WiFi movie/tv option you can connect to using your phone! I‰Ûªm currently on a flight from Boston to Phoenix and was utterly shocked when I sat in my seat and noticed no form of entertainment for a cross-country flight. Delta and other airlines provide personal entertainment screens on each screen or a smartphone connect feature for 2+ hr flights, which in turn make the flights more enjoyable. Anyways, to avoid rambling on and on about the lack of technology on AA planes I‰Ûªll just say if you enjoyed traveling in the late 90s early 2000s, then AA is for you. If you want to travel in 2017 and beyond, find a different airline."
Rania of Miami Beach, FL," Nov. 6, 2017","I had a horrible experience today on my flight back to Miami. I have been an AAdvantage member for many years now and have always chosen to be loyal to American but after today's experience that may change. The onboarding process was fine and the flight was on time, which to be honest is rare but I was happy. When the snacks and beverage cart came the attendant did not smile, looked unhappy to take our beverage order, handed me and my husband 2 cookies, I then I told her, ""Can we just get pretzels?"" She said ""Then I need the cookies back."" I was honestly appalled."
Samiksha of Minnesota, MN," Nov. 3, 2017","Don't deserve single star. Also, I have a flight from Chicago to Minneapolis 5 hours from now. And they have seats available on the earlier flight but won't give you without charging $75. They are ok to make you wait or fly a flight with empty seats but no customer delight which is no cost to them. No customer driven company and not looking for going extra mile to make customer happy. Never travel on American Airlines again."
Tanya of Chandler, AZ," Oct. 31, 2017","Worst experience ever with AA never again, they treated my dad like garbage, they humiliated my dad in front of my niece travelling with him and in front of all passengers, just because my dad is ** and not fluent in English. I wish I could sue them for discrimination against my dad for not speaking English fluent instead of offering assistance in Spanish which, the sky harbor airport in Arizona has plenty of bilingual employees. DO NOT FLY AA EVER, pay more with a different airline. The only reason why my dad and niece flew AA to go to my brother's funeral, thank you AA for the worst day ever. It's a shame I have to put a star instead of no stars service."
Matt of La Mesa, CA," Oct. 30, 2017","This American Airlines review is out of frustration due to a lot of things. They're a disgrace! The employees are rude, there is no leg room, no entertainment, and treat people like herds of sheep. They have a ""New"" rule where they charge $50 at the gate to carry on your luggage. Are you kidding me? $50 for a carry on? And I can't even use the overhead bin! Disgraceful! Basically these guys are crooks! They're a disgrace. Last time I flew with American their flight was delayed by 2 hours and we ended up missing our connecting flight because it was the last flight out. We ended up having to stay an extra day and had to pay $100 for a hotel. We missed my sisters wedding. On the way back we ended up stuck on the tarmac for 2 hours. Of course!"
Naki of Bridgeport, CT," Oct. 29, 2017","I booked a ticket back when the hurricane were hitting down south every other week. Because of that I was not able to attend my trip in GA. They told me I had up to a year to use my ticket. So when I try to rebook my ticket they are now close to $500. Mind you this is the highest rate out of all the airlines for my particular dates, I asked for a refund because I didn't wanna double what I paid the first time and I was told by the Supervisor (Willie ** in Dallas ) that my only option was to ""use it or lost it"". Being a supervisor myself I thought the tone in which he said it was very careless and he didn't try to help the situation at all. I would never talk to my customers the way he spoke to me especially after losing out on $300!!"
Robert of Bellingham, WA," Oct. 26, 2017","I just completed a flight on American Airlines. I had read negative reviews, but I found the American Airlines people I had contact with were great, tried to provide all the service they could because our flight had been cancelled due WX and had to layover at ORD. My complaint is the phoney coupon given for a hotel room for a ""discounted rate"". The coupon has nothing to do with American Airlines, but is only a hotel booking service. When I called the phone number provided I was told the only available room was 10 miles away and given a rate of $80.00. It was getting late in the evening so took it. Then was advised there was a $15 service charge to book the room. American Airline paid none of this. The shuttle bus to the hotel was packed (Other delayed passengers). When I got home I checked the hotel rate and found the same room went for $105. I ""saved"" $10. The hotel was a Holiday Inn Express. Room not bad."
Shongo of San Antonio, TX," Oct. 25, 2017","I was en route from San Antonio Texas to Hong Kong and when checking in for the domestic portion of the flight at the ticket counter, the woman claimed there was a problem with my passport. I asked for details and she claimed ""There are spots on your passport."" I told her the passport was still valid and did not expire until the following year."" She made up some baloney about Homeland Security not letting people fly with spots on their passport. I told her I checked their website and there was no mention of anything like that. She then claimed, ""Oh, they don't tell you."" I said, ""Then how are you supposed to know?"" She then sarcastically claimed I needed glasses, so I put my glasses on and told her those so called spots are not a problem. "
Michelle of Chicago, IL," Oct. 24, 2017","On 10/21/17 Gate L8 Karen. I approached to asked a question this was the initial gate for my flight, she totally ignored me never acknowledged my presence. After about 10 minutes I walked away from the counter. She IMMEDIATELY acknowledged the person that was behind me... I guess I wasn't the right person for her to service."
Cassandra of Toronto, ON," Oct. 23, 2017","Where do I even begin? I had a round trip flight booked from Toronto, Ontario to Busan, South Korea back in the month of July (2017). While I was away, I heard the news that my dad had passed away. In which, I contacted American Airlines right away and asked if anything can be done. I wanted to fly back before my actual trip date, due to obvious reasons. I even offered to provide them with a death certificate if need be (although, I don't think that is even something they should ask for right away). I spoke to 3 different customer service reps who were all horrible to speak with. They had zero compassion and empathy and just dismissed me as if what I was experiencing was far from a big deal to them. "
Magda of Myrtle Beach, SC," Oct. 23, 2017","I was on the plane for 14 hours due to a delay. Sitting in a broken seat that would not recline. I told the stewardess and she could care less, said nothing she can do. After I got home I contacted the airline and they issued me a fourteen dollar credit. I had paid 197.34 dollars for preferred seats. The worst flight of my life, never again w/ this airline."
Wesley of New Braunfels, TX," Oct. 22, 2017","Overall, (Un)American Airlines continues to disappoint. I really only ever fly with AA as a last resort, and I can't see any reason to recommend traveling with AA. I was prior active duty Army, and now I'm a reservist, and only American Airlines makes me feel like my service is less important now. United, Southwest, Jet Blue, Delta, every other airline doesn't discriminate between Active Duty and Reserve/Guardsmen when it comes to bag fees. So, along with uncomfortable, outdated planes and poor service, I spent a $100 checking bags to and from my destination."
Karen of Roseville, CA," Oct. 19, 2017",American Airlines is the worst airlines to fly anywhere. They cram you in the seats with no leg room or any room for that matter. I requested a wheelchair at airport and waited 30 minutes upon someone finally arriving. They took me the wrong way to my next check in and I missed my flight. They said I would have to rebook my ticket and just wait for the next flight. Attendant at the gate was very disrespectful and not helpful at all. I had no control over this situation at all. Not to mention when I did finally arrive at my destination that I requested a wheelchair prior to my departure.
Nicole of Fresno, CA," Oct. 15, 2017","American Airlines is the worst airline in THE WORLD, and should change their name, it is utterly disgraceful that as an American they use this name. Their policy is to not apologize for anything, to be as rude as possible to people who are basically held hostage to them and their BS policies like closing the door to the gate while people are standing there then charging them money to rebook their flight, not caring at all about the bags on their way to a destination without the owners there to pick them up. Then being told when lodging a complaint that it was going in one ear and out the other. I have never been treated so poorly in my life, I will never again fly with this airline, I hope they go bankrupt and get the worst karma life can give. Oh yeah and I get to fly with them tomorrow. :/"
latanya of Winnetka, CA," Oct. 12, 2017","Very disappointed. Unlikely I will ever choose American Airlines again. I didn't make my flight in the spring. I was given a voucher to use for future travel. Now I'm being told I can only use it myself, and not for my family. I don't want to use it for myself. What difference does it make? I'm being told different things by different people. The last guy hung up on me and I wasn't even rude to him. This is how AA does business? All I want is to not be penalized for cancelling a flight that was beyond my control. If you have a voucher it should be flexible to use for anyone. AA is the WORST! Hope they go out of business for this nonsense. Airline travel is a joke."
George of Key West, FL," Oct. 10, 2017","American Airlines canceled my 92-year-old father-in-law's flight to Key West due to Hurricane Irma. On that day American Airline was contacted and the representative said there would be no problem re-booking, just use the reference number. American Airlines even went on TV and said they would waive re-booking fees. Today when calling to re-book the flight and after 57 minutes on the phone, I was told the flight could not be re-booked because it was in their notes I requested a refund. At no time did I request a refund and American Airlines could not locate any record of a refund request. Even so, American Airlines still insisted they could not re-book the flight or issue a refund. If we did not have enough trouble dealing with a Cat 4 hurricane and its devastating aftermath, now American Airlines is adding to the misery. All my father-in-law wants is to come to Key West and see that everyone is alright. Thanks, AA."
George of Barnegat, NJ," Oct. 4, 2017",I bought tickets for my mother in law and son to meet my wife and I in Colorado. We had traveled on different airlines due to connections and therefore were going back on different airlines. My wife and I left on our airplane. My mother in law and son were stranded as the plane had a mechanical. This was 8 AM and the bottom line was it didn't get fixed that day. American gave them a 12.00 voucher good in the terminal and did nothing to get them a room as the rooms they usually used weren't available.
Steven of Phoenix, AZ," Oct. 2, 2017","I booked 2 separate flights on American Airlines in Economy since I pay for my air travel. On one they pre-assigned me a back-of-plane middle seat and said that I was required to pay some increased fee for window, aisle or closer to the front. On the second flight they said I have to wait until I reach the boarding gate for any seat. This is ridiculous and unacceptable. The airline has sufficient revenue to - just a suggestion - increase the ""base"" fare to cover a first-come-first-served seat selection and not put everyone into 3rd class or worse status. If they want to surcharge certain premium seats, like middle seats toward the front, that's OK, but this behavior is totally unacceptable and I refuse to fly them (or any airline) that abuses their passengers."
Benjamin of Glendale, AZ," Sept. 26, 2017",Well I looked into changing my flight for my fiance and I to go home a day earlier... only to discover that American charges $200.00 a ticket PLUS the difference in price tickets! LIKE THAT IS GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE! So for the price of another ticket I can change my flight! I will be looking elsewhere for flights in the future. I have already paid for a flight and now you are trying to rip me off even more!?! Out of touch and terrible service to a customer of over 5 years. I will be going elsewhere where I don't get bent over the table. Thank you American!
Kay of Washington, DC," Sept. 22, 2017","I originally booked my flight to Miami from Washington, DC back in July 2017. I was scheduled to fly September 13-18, 2017. I, like many, had to cancel my trip because of hurricane Irma. I was informed by two customer service representatives that I would be able to rebook my flight to Miami with no additional charges in fare and no change fees. Of course, when it comes time to book my flight, I'm informed about a change fee. I told the agent, I was reassured twice that I would not be charged any additional fees because my initial cancellation was weather related. "
Tenika of Thomasville, NC," Sept. 22, 2017","American Airlines is full of **. Our cruise was cancelled due to Hurricane Irma. It was beyond our control and the airline stated there was nothing that they could do. No partial credit, changes or anything! I will not be flying with them anymore!"
Katie of Lasalle, IL," Sept. 22, 2017",My husband and I were scheduled to fly out at 7:15 am to go to California for a very important family matter. We do not live near the airport so we were up early to make sure we were early and nothing could go wrong. But things did go wrong. When we got to the airport we went and printed out tickets at the self checkout. We did notice that it mentioned no overhead storage for our carry on bags. So confused because we fly a lot and there is always overhead storage or they place in under the cabin. So we asked a lady that was standing in the area of self print and she looked and our tickets said we would be fine... Again we were told wrong.
Paul of Ajax, ON," Sept. 19, 2017","On September 4 my family of 5 arrived at the airport in Anchorage to fly home to Toronto via Dallas. Four of us had carry-on sized luggage but one had a mid-sized suitcase that we knew we would have to check. Our flight to Toronto included a 12.5-hour connection at DFW (not by choice). Since none of us sleep well on planes, we were considering going to a hotel following the overnight flight to DFW. When checking the suitcase, I specifically asked the American Airlines agent ""if we only check this bag to DFW and then go to a hotel for a few hours of sleep, will we be charged a second baggage fee to check the bag in for the flight to Toronto? If so we can rearrange the bags so that we can just check it through to Toronto."" "
Terri of Powell, OH," Sept. 16, 2017","I purchased the basic economy ticket. When I was getting ready to board in Charlotte, the attendant mentioned that this was a new program for your airline and that customers have stated it was cost effective. However, this was not my case! I paid nearly $600 to fly from Columbus, OH to Asheville, NC. Absolutely absurd!!! In the future, I will do all I can to avoid flying with your airline and don't count on a positive recommendation from me to others! Also, stop charging for the first piece of checked in luggage!"
karina of North Miami, FL," Sept. 15, 2017","I did a reservation with AA Sept 10, 2017 over the phone to Miami for Sept 12, 2017 in the flight # 1399. September 11 I checked the flight online and it was canceled. I called customer service. Patricia told me that I was wrong it wasn't cancel. I called at night again because I was worried I saw it was still cancel. After almost 2 hours they answered the phone. I told them what happened. They told me that they were very sorry but the flight was canceled and they didnt' have flight for Sept 12. They gave me 1 stop flight for Sept 13. "
Shannon of Sarasota, FL," Sept. 15, 2017","I was scheduled to fly out of Tampa International on Sunday, September, 17th to Durango, CO. I live in Sarasota, and just returned home the other day after evacuating for Hurricane Irma. I fled Florida and headed to Georgia, where I had to rent a hotel for a few nights. When I returned home I was fortunate enough not to have suffered damage. I of course have yard debris strewn about and I am still without power. The power company has estimated by the end of the day on September 22nd I will have power. With the extra costs incurred from having to leave my home, and the loss of power, I decided this was not a good time to travel."
Darcy of Charlotte, NC," Sept. 12, 2017","Hurricane Irma was mess for AA. I get it. I'm sure there were thousands who were stuck trying to get their flights changed. Unfortunately, I was in Costa Rica with a connection via Miami and I got, as the AA agent said ""the short end of the stick."" I would be stuck almost another week in Costa Rica as everything AA had was booked out or cancelled. I saw a little bit of silver lining when I found that if I could get to Mexico city, I could fly home via DFW. However, AA would not change the ticket as it is against their rules to change the country of origin on a ticket. ""We cannot do it."" However, a more accurate description is ""will not."""
Maradith of Wickett, TX," Sept. 10, 2017","We were delayed on our AA out of Seattle due to having to wait on flight crew. Managed to make it to Dallas on time BUT had to sit on the tarmac for 20 mins waiting for a gait in order to deplane. This caused to miss our connecting flight. Next available flight is the next day. Asked about compensation for overnight hotel stay (there are 7 in our party, including a 3 year old) and were denied due to the delay being coded as weather related, which is absolutely bogus. So livid, frustrated, and tired at this point. Also found out AA has no number to call for complaints... You have to go through email so who knows if they will even read it or reply. Will never fly AA again if I can help it."
Alex of Orlando, FL," Sept. 9, 2017","I was on an almost 2 hour flight (Flight AA3936) stuck sitting with one leg over my bag and the other on the edge of the aisle.

Today when calling to re-book the flight and after 57 minutes on the phone, I was told the flight could not be re-booked because it was in their notes I requested a refund. At no time did I request a refund and American Airlines could not locate any record of a refund request. Even so, American Airlines still insisted they could not re-book the flight or issue a refund. If we did not have enough trouble dealing with a Cat 4 hurricane and its devastating aftermath, now American Airlines is adding to the misery. All my father-in-law wants is to come to Key West and see that everyone is alright. Thanks, AA."
Courtney of Nn, VA," Aug. 19, 2017",I bought tickets for my mother in law and son to meet my wife and I in Colorado. We had traveled on different airlines due to connections and therefore were going back on different airlines. My wife and I left on our airplane. My mother in law and son were stranded as the plane had a mechanical. This was 8 AM and the bottom line was it didn't get fixed that day. American gave them a 12.00 voucher good in the terminal and did nothing to get them a room as the rooms they usually used weren't available.
Anna of San Antonio, TX," Aug. 19, 2017","I booked 2 separate flights on American Airlines in Economy since I pay for my air travel. On one they pre-assigned me a back-of-plane middle seat and said that I was required to pay some increased fee for window, aisle or closer to the front. On the second flight they said I have to wait until I reach the boarding gate for any seat. This is ridiculous and unacceptable. The airline has sufficient revenue to - just a suggestion - increase the ""base"" fare to cover a first-come-first-served seat selection and not put everyone into 3rd class or worse status. If they want to surcharge certain premium seats, like middle seats toward the front, that's OK, but this behavior is totally unacceptable and I refuse to fly them (or any airline) that abuses their passengers."
Pauline of The Woodlands, TX," Aug. 17, 2017",Well I looked into changing my flight for my fiance and I to go home a day earlier... only to discover that American charges $200.00 a ticket PLUS the difference in price tickets! LIKE THAT IS GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE! So for the price of another ticket I can change my flight! I will be looking elsewhere for flights in the future. I have already paid for a flight and now you are trying to rip me off even more!?! Out of touch and terrible service to a customer of over 5 years. I will be going elsewhere where I don't get bent over the table. Thank you American!
Hanan of Denver, CO," Aug. 17, 2017","I originally booked my flight to Miami from Washington, DC back in July 2017. I was scheduled to fly September 13-18, 2017. I, like many, had to cancel my trip because of hurricane Irma. I was informed by two customer service representatives that I would be able to rebook my flight to Miami with no additional charges in fare and no change fees. Of course, when it comes time to book my flight, I'm informed about a change fee. I told the agent, I was reassured twice that I would not be charged any additional fees because my initial cancellation was weather related. "
LINDA of Archer, FL," Aug. 15, 2017","American Airlines is full of **. Our cruise was cancelled due to Hurricane Irma. It was beyond our control and the airline stated there was nothing that they could do. No partial credit, changes or anything! I will not be flying with them anymore!"
tom of Aventura, FL," Aug. 14, 2017",My husband and I were scheduled to fly out at 7:15 am to go to California for a very important family matter. We do not live near the airport so we were up early to make sure we were early and nothing could go wrong. But things did go wrong. When we got to the airport we went and printed out tickets at the self checkout. We did notice that it mentioned no overhead storage for our carry on bags. So confused because we fly a lot and there is always overhead storage or they place in under the cabin. So we asked a lady that was standing in the area of self print and she looked and our tickets said we would be fine... Again we were told wrong.
Diana of Kerrville, TX," Aug. 7, 2017","On September 4 my family of 5 arrived at the airport in Anchorage to fly home to Toronto via Dallas. Four of us had carry-on sized luggage but one had a mid-sized suitcase that we knew we would have to check. Our flight to Toronto included a 12.5-hour connection at DFW (not by choice). Since none of us sleep well on planes, we were considering going to a hotel following the overnight flight to DFW. When checking the suitcase, I specifically asked the American Airlines agent ""if we only check this bag to DFW and then go to a hotel for a few hours of sleep, will we be charged a second baggage fee to check the bag in for the flight to Toronto? If so we can rearrange the bags so that we can just check it through to Toronto."" "

When I was getting ready to board in Charlotte, the attendant mentioned that this was a new program for your airline and that customers have stated it was cost effective. However, this was not my case! I paid nearly $600 to fly from Columbus, OH to Asheville, NC. Absolutely absurd!!! In the future, I will do all I can to avoid flying with your airline and don't count on a positive recommendation from me to others! Also, stop charging for the first piece of checked in luggage!"

I called at night again because I was worried I saw it was still cancel. After almost 2 hours they answered the phone. I told them what happened. They told me that they were very sorry but the flight was canceled and they didnt' have flight for Sept 12. They gave me 1 stop flight for Sept 13. "
Herman of Phoenix, AZ," Aug. 2, 2017","I was scheduled to fly out of Tampa International on Sunday, September, 17th to Durango, CO. I live in Sarasota, and just returned home the other day after evacuating for Hurricane Irma. I fled Florida and headed to Georgia, where I had to rent a hotel for a few nights. When I returned home I was fortunate enough not to have suffered damage. I of course have yard debris strewn about and I am still without power. The power company has estimated by the end of the day on September 22nd I will have power. With the extra costs incurred from having to leave my home, and the loss of power, I decided this was not a good time to travel."
Jason of Chesterfield, NJ," Aug. 2, 2017","Hurricane Irma was mess for AA. I get it. I'm sure there were thousands who were stuck trying to get their flights changed. Unfortunately, I was in Costa Rica with a connection via Miami and I got, as the AA agent said ""the short end of the stick."" I would be stuck almost another week in Costa Rica as everything AA had was booked out or cancelled. I saw a little bit of silver lining when I found that if I could get to Mexico city, I could fly home via DFW. However, AA would not change the ticket as it is against their rules to change the country of origin on a ticket. ""We cannot do it."" However, a more accurate description is ""will not."""
Danny of Hemsworth, Other," Aug. 2, 2017","We were delayed on our AA out of Seattle due to having to wait on flight crew. Managed to make it to Dallas on time BUT had to sit on the tarmac for 20 mins waiting for a gait in order to deplane. This caused to miss our connecting flight. Next available flight is the next day. Asked about compensation for overnight hotel stay (there are 7 in our party, including a 3 year old) and were denied due to the delay being coded as weather related, which is absolutely bogus. So livid, frustrated, and tired at this point. Also found out AA has no number to call for complaints... You have to go through email so who knows if they will even read it or reply. Will never fly AA again if I can help it."
Zora of Naperville, IL," Aug. 2, 2017","I was on an almost 2 hour flight (Flight AA3936) stuck sitting with one leg over my bag and the other on the edge of the aisle. Not once was I asked to check in my bag nor told it wouldn't fit on the overhead bin. By the time we landed my knees, hips and back were killing me and I had to have help from the gentleman next to me to be able to stand up. So glad there wasn't an emergency 'cause this would have been one hell of a hazard. Lesson learned not to use this airline again."
tom of Los Angeles, CA," Aug. 1, 2017","American Airlines‰Û_the new standard for horrible service. Oh‰Û_I mean HORRIBLE! I travel very frequently for work and have stuck to one specific airline in order to build my status with them (ie. first class upgrades often, better seat choices, free checked bags). Recently, service has taken a turn for the worse. I‰Ûªm a reasonable guy and tolerate more than most. Call it my Southern hospitality, my upbringing or my service to the community when I served in law enforcement, but I just plain put up with more‰Û_until now."
Anna of San Antonio, TX," July 31, 2017","I travel 80%~ for Work and have flown with almost every airline multiple times. AA is by far the worst. Not due to their customer service/staff/delays or anything like that (at least that I‰Ûªve noticed), but their planes have no entertainment system on each seat, they do not play movies on the overhead screens, and they don‰Ûªt even have a free WiFi movie/tv option you can connect to using your phone! I‰Ûªm currently on a flight from Boston to Phoenix and was utterly shocked when I sat in my seat and noticed no form of entertainment for a cross-country flight. Delta and other airlines provide personal entertainment screens on each screen or a smartphone connect feature for 2+ hr flights, which in turn make the flights more enjoyable. Anyways, to avoid rambling on and on about the lack of technology on AA planes I‰Ûªll just say if you enjoyed traveling in the late 90s early 2000s, then AA is for you. If you want to travel in 2017 and beyond, find a different airline."
Neeti of New Delhi, Other," July 29, 2017","I had a horrible experience today on my flight back to Miami. I have been an AAdvantage member for many years now and have always chosen to be loyal to American but after today's experience that may change. The onboarding process was fine and the flight was on time, which to be honest is rare but I was happy. When the snacks and beverage cart came the attendant did not smile, looked unhappy to take our beverage order, handed me and my husband 2 cookies, I then I told her, ""Can we just get pretzels?"" She said ""Then I need the cookies back."" I was honestly appalled."
Rolando of Miami, FL," July 29, 2017","Don't deserve single star. Also, I have a flight from Chicago to Minneapolis 5 hours from now. And they have seats available on the earlier flight but won't give you without charging $75. They are ok to make you wait or fly a flight with empty seats but no customer delight which is no cost to them. No customer driven company and not looking for going extra mile to make customer happy. Never travel on American Airlines again."
JOHN of Wildomar, CA," July 27, 2017","Worst experience ever with AA never again, they treated my dad like garbage, they humiliated my dad in front of my niece travelling with him and in front of all passengers, just because my dad is ** and not fluent in English. I wish I could sue them for discrimination against my dad for not speaking English fluent instead of offering assistance in Spanish which, the sky harbor airport in Arizona has plenty of bilingual employees. DO NOT FLY AA EVER, pay more with a different airline. The only reason why my dad and niece flew AA to go to my brother's funeral, thank you AA for the worst day ever. It's a shame I have to put a star instead of no stars service."
J. C. of Vienna, VA," July 27, 2017","This American Airlines review is out of frustration due to a lot of things. They're a disgrace! The employees are rude, there is no leg room, no entertainment, and treat people like herds of sheep. They have a ""New"" rule where they charge $50 at the gate to carry on your luggage. Are you kidding me? $50 for a carry on? And I can't even use the overhead bin! Disgraceful! Basically these guys are crooks! They're a disgrace. Last time I flew with American their flight was delayed by 2 hours and we ended up missing our connecting flight because it was the last flight out. We ended up having to stay an extra day and had to pay $100 for a hotel. We missed my sisters wedding. On the way back we ended up stuck on the tarmac for 2 hours. Of course!"
Danielle of New Orelans, LA," July 26, 2017","I booked a ticket back when the hurricane were hitting down south every other week. Because of that I was not able to attend my trip in GA. They told me I had up to a year to use my ticket. So when I try to rebook my ticket they are now close to $500. Mind you this is the highest rate out of all the airlines for my particular dates, I asked for a refund because I didn't wanna double what I paid the first time and I was told by the Supervisor (Willie ** in Dallas ) that my only option was to ""use it or lost it"". Being a supervisor myself I thought the tone in which he said it was very careless and he didn't try to help the situation at all. I would never talk to my customers the way he spoke to me especially after losing out on $300!!"
Barbara of Saint Augustine, FL," July 25, 2017","I just completed a flight on American Airlines. I had read negative reviews, but I found the American Airlines people I had contact with were great, tried to provide all the service they could because our flight had been cancelled due WX and had to layover at ORD. My complaint is the phoney coupon given for a hotel room for a ""discounted rate"". The coupon has nothing to do with American Airlines, but is only a hotel booking service. When I called the phone number provided I was told the only available room was 10 miles away and given a rate of $80.00. It was getting late in the evening so took it. Then was advised there was a $15 service charge to book the room. American Airline paid none of this. The shuttle bus to the hotel was packed (Other delayed passengers). When I got home I checked the hotel rate and found the same room went for $105. I ""saved"" $10. The hotel was a Holiday Inn Express. Room not bad."
Paula of Plano, TX," July 25, 2017","I was en route from San Antonio Texas to Hong Kong and when checking in for the domestic portion of the flight at the ticket counter, the woman claimed there was a problem with my passport. I asked for details and she claimed ""There are spots on your passport."" I told her the passport was still valid and did not expire until the following year."" She made up some baloney about Homeland Security not letting people fly with spots on their passport. I told her I checked their website and there was no mention of anything like that. She then claimed, ""Oh, they don't tell you."" I said, ""Then how are you supposed to know?"" She then sarcastically claimed I needed glasses, so I put my glasses on and told her those so called spots are not a problem. "

While I was away, I heard the news that my dad had passed away. In which, I contacted American Airlines right away and asked if anything can be done. I wanted to fly back before my actual trip date, due to obvious reasons. I even offered to provide them with a death certificate if need be (although, I don't think that is even something they should ask for right away). I spoke to 3 different customer service reps who were all horrible to speak with. They had zero compassion and empathy and just dismissed me as if what I was experiencing was far from a big deal to them. "
Nichelle of Oconto, WI," July 21, 2017","I was on the plane for 14 hours due to a delay. Sitting in a broken seat that would not recline. I told the stewardess and she could care less, said nothing she can do. After I got home I contacted the airline and they issued me a fourteen dollar credit. I had paid 197.34 dollars for preferred seats. The worst flight of my life, never again w/ this airline."
Marian of Pasadena, MD," July 19, 2017","Overall, (Un)American Airlines continues to disappoint. I really only ever fly with AA as a last resort, and I can't see any reason to recommend traveling with AA. I was prior active duty Army, and now I'm a reservist, and only American Airlines makes me feel like my service is less important now. United, Southwest, Jet Blue, Delta, every other airline doesn't discriminate between Active Duty and Reserve/Guardsmen when it comes to bag fees. So, along with uncomfortable, outdated planes and poor service, I spent a $100 checking bags to and from my destination."
Vic of Evans, GA," July 18, 2017",American Airlines is the worst airlines to fly anywhere. They cram you in the seats with no leg room or any room for that matter. I requested a wheelchair at airport and waited 30 minutes upon someone finally arriving. They took me the wrong way to my next check in and I missed my flight. They said I would have to rebook my ticket and just wait for the next flight. Attendant at the gate was very disrespectful and not helpful at all. I had no control over this situation at all. Not to mention when I did finally arrive at my destination that I requested a wheelchair prior to my departure.
James of North Chesterfield, VA," July 16, 2017","American Airlines is the worst airline in THE WORLD, and should change their name, it is utterly disgraceful that as an American they use this name. Their policy is to not apologize for anything, to be as rude as possible to people who are basically held hostage to them and their BS policies like closing the door to the gate while people are standing there then charging them money to rebook their flight, not caring at all about the bags on their way to a destination without the owners there to pick them up. Then being told when lodging a complaint that it was going in one ear and out the other. I have never been treated so poorly in my life, I will never again fly with this airline, I hope they go bankrupt and get the worst karma life can give. Oh yeah and I get to fly with them tomorrow. :/"
Anh of Tampa, FL," July 16, 2017","Very disappointed. Unlikely I will ever choose American Airlines again. I didn't make my flight in the spring. I was given a voucher to use for future travel. Now I'm being told I can only use it myself, and not for my family. I don't want to use it for myself. What difference does it make? I'm being told different things by different people. The last guy hung up on me and I wasn't even rude to him. This is how AA does business? All I want is to not be penalized for cancelling a flight that was beyond my control. If you have a voucher it should be flexible to use for anyone. AA is the WORST! Hope they go out of business for this nonsense. Airline travel is a joke."

It's a shame I have to put a star instead of no stars service."
Marylou of Berlin, Other," June 22, 2017","This American Airlines review is out of frustration due to a lot of things. They're a disgrace! The employees are rude, there is no leg room, no entertainment, and treat people like herds of sheep. They have a ""New"" rule where they charge $50 at the gate to carry on your luggage. Are you kidding me? $50 for a carry on? And I can't even use the overhead bin! Disgraceful! Basically these guys are crooks! They're a disgrace. Last time I flew with American their flight was delayed by 2 hours and we ended up missing our connecting flight because it was the last flight out. We ended up having to stay an extra day and had to pay $100 for a hotel. We missed my sisters wedding. On the way back we ended up stuck on the tarmac for 2 hours. Of course!"
Roger of Milton, GA," June 21, 2017","I booked a ticket back when the hurricane were hitting down south every other week. Because of that I was not able to attend my trip in GA. They told me I had up to a year to use my ticket. So when I try to rebook my ticket they are now close to $500. Mind you this is the highest rate out of all the airlines for my particular dates, I asked for a refund because I didn't wanna double what I paid the first time and I was told by the Supervisor (Willie ** in Dallas ) that my only option was to ""use it or lost it"". Being a supervisor myself I thought the tone in which he said it was very careless and he didn't try to help the situation at all. I would never talk to my customers the way he spoke to me especially after losing out on $300!!"
Catherine of St. Paul, MN," June 20, 2017","I just completed a flight on American Airlines. I had read negative reviews, but I found the American Airlines people I had contact with were great, tried to provide all the service they could because our flight had been cancelled due WX and had to layover at ORD. My complaint is the phoney coupon given for a hotel room for a ""discounted rate"". The coupon has nothing to do with American Airlines, but is only a hotel booking service. When I called the phone number provided I was told the only available room was 10 miles away and given a rate of $80.00. It was getting late in the evening so took it. Then was advised there was a $15 service charge to book the room. American Airline paid none of this. The shuttle bus to the hotel was packed (Other delayed passengers). When I got home I checked the hotel rate and found the same room went for $105. I ""saved"" $10. The hotel was a Holiday Inn Express. Room not bad."

She made up some baloney about Homeland Security not letting people fly with spots on their passport. I told her I checked their website and there was no mention of anything like that. She then claimed, ""Oh, they don't tell you."" I said, ""Then how are you supposed to know?""

I wanted to fly back before my actual trip date, due to obvious reasons. I even offered to provide them with a death certificate if need be (although, I don't think that is even something they should ask for right away).

I had paid 197.34 dollars for preferred seats. The worst flight of my life, never again w/ this airline."
K. Z. of Huntersville, NC," June 15, 2017","Overall, (Un)American Airlines continues to disappoint. I really only ever fly with AA as a last resort, and I can't see any reason to recommend traveling with AA. I was prior active duty Army, and now I'm a reservist, and only American Airlines makes me feel like my service is less important now. United, Southwest, Jet Blue, Delta, every other airline doesn't discriminate between Active Duty and Reserve/Guardsmen when it comes to bag fees. So, along with uncomfortable, outdated planes and poor service, I spent a $100 checking bags to and from my destination."
Jorge of Rio Grande, Other," June 11, 2017",American Airlines is the worst airlines to fly anywhere. They cram you in the seats with no leg room or any room for that matter. I requested a wheelchair at airport and waited 30 minutes upon someone finally arriving. They took me the wrong way to my next check in and I missed my flight. They said I would have to rebook my ticket and just wait for the next flight. Attendant at the gate was very disrespectful and not helpful at all. I had no control over this situation at all. Not to mention when I did finally arrive at my destination that I requested a wheelchair prior to my departure.
Donald of La Palma, CA," June 10, 2017","American Airlines is the worst airline in THE WORLD, and should change their name, it is utterly disgraceful that as an American they use this name. Their policy is to not apologize for anything, to be as rude as possible to people who are basically held hostage to them and their BS policies like closing the door to the gate while people are standing there then charging them money to rebook their flight, not caring at all about the bags on their way to a destination without the owners there to pick them up. Then being told when lodging a complaint that it was going in one ear and out the other. I have never been treated so poorly in my life, I will never again fly with this airline, I hope they go bankrupt and get the worst karma life can give. Oh yeah and I get to fly with them tomorrow. :/"
Suzy of Columbus, OH," June 10, 2017","Very disappointed. Unlikely I will ever choose American Airlines again. I didn't make my flight in the spring. I was given a voucher to use for future travel. Now I'm being told I can only use it myself, and not for my family. I don't want to use it for myself. What difference does it make? I'm being told different things by different people. The last guy hung up on me and I wasn't even rude to him. This is how AA does business? All I want is to not be penalized for cancelling a flight that was beyond my control. If you have a voucher it should be flexible to use for anyone. AA is the WORST! Hope they go out of business for this nonsense. Airline travel is a joke."
Kendall of Anchorage, AK," June 10, 2017","American Airlines canceled my 92-year-old father-in-law's flight to Key West due to Hurricane Irma. On that day American Airline was contacted and the representative said there would be no problem re-booking, just use the reference number. American Airlines even went on TV and said they would waive re-booking fees. Today when calling to re-book the flight and after 57 minutes on the phone, I was told the flight could not be re-booked because it was in their notes I requested a refund. At no time did I request a refund and American Airlines could not locate any record of a refund request. Even so, American Airlines still insisted they could not re-book the flight or issue a refund. If we did not have enough trouble dealing with a Cat 4 hurricane and its devastating aftermath, now American Airlines is adding to the misery. All my father-in-law wants is to come to Key West and see that everyone is alright. Thanks, AA."
Tim of Summerfield, FL," June 10, 2017",I bought tickets for my mother in law and son to meet my wife and I in Colorado. We had traveled on different airlines due to connections and therefore were going back on different airlines. My wife and I left on our airplane. My mother in law and son were stranded as the plane had a mechanical. This was 8 AM and the bottom line was it didn't get fixed that day. American gave them a 12.00 voucher good in the terminal and did nothing to get them a room as the rooms they usually used weren't available.
Cynthia of La Crescenta, CA," June 9, 2017","I booked 2 separate flights on American Airlines in Economy since I pay for my air travel. On one they pre-assigned me a back-of-plane middle seat and said that I was required to pay some increased fee for window, aisle or closer to the front. On the second flight they said I have to wait until I reach the boarding gate for any seat. This is ridiculous and unacceptable. The airline has sufficient revenue to - just a suggestion - increase the ""base"" fare to cover a first-come-first-served seat selection and not put everyone into 3rd class or worse status. If they want to surcharge certain premium seats, like middle seats toward the front, that's OK, but this behavior is totally unacceptable and I refuse to fly them (or any airline) that abuses their passengers."
Todd of Plymouth, MA," June 9, 2017",Well I looked into changing my flight for my fiance and I to go home a day earlier... only to discover that American charges $200.00 a ticket PLUS the difference in price tickets! LIKE THAT IS GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE! So for the price of another ticket I can change my flight! I will be looking elsewhere for flights in the future. I have already paid for a flight and now you are trying to rip me off even more!?! Out of touch and terrible service to a customer of over 5 years. I will be going elsewhere where I don't get bent over the table. Thank you American!

I was informed by two customer service representatives that I would be able to rebook my flight to Miami with no additional charges in fare and no change fees. Of course, when it comes time to book my flight, I'm informed about a change fee. I told the agent, I was reassured twice that I would not be charged any additional fees because my initial cancellation was weather related. "
Nhan of Albemarle, NC," June 6, 2017","American Airlines is full of **. Our cruise was cancelled due to Hurricane Irma. It was beyond our control and the airline stated there was nothing that they could do. No partial credit, changes or anything! I will not be flying with them anymore!"
neena of Cordeaux Heights, Other," June 4, 2017",My husband and I were scheduled to fly out at 7:15 am to go to California for a very important family matter. We do not live near the airport so we were up early to make sure we were early and nothing could go wrong. But things did go wrong. When we got to the airport we went and printed out tickets at the self checkout. We did notice that it mentioned no overhead storage for our carry on bags. So confused because we fly a lot and there is always overhead storage or they place in under the cabin. So we asked a lady that was standing in the area of self print and she looked and our tickets said we would be fine... Again we were told wrong.
Leah of New Kent, VA," June 3, 2017","On September 4 my family of 5 arrived at the airport in Anchorage to fly home to Toronto via Dallas. Four of us had carry-on sized luggage but one had a mid-sized suitcase that we knew we would have to check. Our flight to Toronto included a 12.5-hour connection at DFW (not by choice). Since none of us sleep well on planes, we were considering going to a hotel following the overnight flight to DFW. When checking the suitcase, I specifically asked the American Airlines agent ""if we only check this bag to DFW and then go to a hotel for a few hours of sleep, will we be charged a second baggage fee to check the bag in for the flight to Toronto? If so we can rearrange the bags so that we can just check it through to Toronto."" "
Matt of Albuquerque, NM," May 31, 2017","I purchased the basic economy ticket. When I was getting ready to board in Charlotte, the attendant mentioned that this was a new program for your airline and that customers have stated it was cost effective.

In the future, I will do all I can to avoid flying with your airline and don't count on a positive recommendation from me to others! Also, stop charging for the first piece of checked in luggage!"

I called at night again because I was worried I saw it was still cancel. After almost 2 hours they answered the phone. I told them what happened. They told me that they were very sorry but the flight was canceled and they didnt' have flight for Sept 12. They gave me 1 stop flight for Sept 13. "
Wendy of Jacksonville, NC," May 25, 2017","I was scheduled to fly out of Tampa International on Sunday, September, 17th to Durango, CO. I live in Sarasota, and just returned home the other day after evacuating for Hurricane Irma. I fled Florida and headed to Georgia, where I had to rent a hotel for a few nights. When I returned home I was fortunate enough not to have suffered damage. I of course have yard debris strewn about and I am still without power. The power company has estimated by the end of the day on September 22nd I will have power. With the extra costs incurred from having to leave my home, and the loss of power, I decided this was not a good time to travel."
Robert of Scituate, RI," May 24, 2017","Hurricane Irma was mess for AA. I get it. I'm sure there were thousands who were stuck trying to get their flights changed. Unfortunately, I was in Costa Rica with a connection via Miami and I got, as the AA agent said ""the short end of the stick."" I would be stuck almost another week in Costa Rica as everything AA had was booked out or cancelled. I saw a little bit of silver lining when I found that if I could get to Mexico city, I could fly home via DFW. However, AA would not change the ticket as it is against their rules to change the country of origin on a ticket. ""We cannot do it."" However, a more accurate description is ""will not."""
S. of Pawleys Island, SC," May 22, 2017","We were delayed on our AA out of Seattle due to having to wait on flight crew. Managed to make it to Dallas on time BUT had to sit on the tarmac for 20 mins waiting for a gait in order to deplane. This caused to miss our connecting flight. Next available flight is the next day. Asked about compensation for overnight hotel stay (there are 7 in our party, including a 3 year old) and were denied due to the delay being coded as weather related, which is absolutely bogus. So livid, frustrated, and tired at this point. Also found out AA has no number to call for complaints... You have to go through email so who knows if they will even read it or reply. Will never fly AA again if I can help it."
Bea of San Antonio, TX," May 22, 2017","I was on an almost 2 hour flight (Flight AA3936) stuck sitting with one leg over my bag and the other on the edge of the aisle. Not once was I asked to check in my bag nor told it wouldn't fit on the overhead bin. By the time we landed my knees, hips and back were killing me and I had to have help from the gentleman next to me to be able to stand up. So glad there wasn't an emergency 'cause this would have been one hell of a hazard. Lesson learned not to use this airline again."
yunsun of Tacoma, WA," May 21, 2017","American Airlines‰Û_the new standard for horrible service. Oh‰Û_I mean HORRIBLE! I travel very frequently for work and have stuck to one specific airline in order to build my status with them (ie. first class upgrades often, better seat choices, free checked bags). Recently, service has taken a turn for the worse. I‰Ûªm a reasonable guy and tolerate more than most. Call it my Southern hospitality, my upbringing or my service to the community when I served in law enforcement, but I just plain put up with more‰Û_until now."
greg of Colmesneil, TX," May 20, 2017","I travel 80%~ for Work and have flown with almost every airline multiple times. AA is by far the worst. Not due to their customer service/staff/delays or anything like that (at least that I‰Ûªve noticed), but their planes have no entertainment system on each seat, they do not play movies on the overhead screens, and they don‰Ûªt even have a free WiFi movie/tv option you can connect to using your phone! I‰Ûªm currently on a flight from Boston to Phoenix and was utterly shocked when I sat in my seat and noticed no form of entertainment for a cross-country flight. Delta and other airlines provide personal entertainment screens on each screen or a smartphone connect feature for 2+ hr flights, which in turn make the flights more enjoyable. Anyways, to avoid rambling on and on about the lack of technology on AA planes I‰Ûªll just say if you enjoyed traveling in the late 90s early 2000s, then AA is for you. If you want to travel in 2017 and beyond, find a different airline."
Alix of Philadelphia, PA," May 18, 2017","I had a horrible experience today on my flight back to Miami. I have been an AAdvantage member for many years now and have always chosen to be loyal to American but after today's experience that may change. The onboarding process was fine and the flight was on time, which to be honest is rare but I was happy. When the snacks and beverage cart came the attendant did not smile, looked unhappy to take our beverage order, handed me and my husband 2 cookies, I then I told her, ""Can we just get pretzels?"" She said ""Then I need the cookies back."" I was honestly appalled."
Ramakrishna of Katy, TX," May 15, 2017","Don't deserve single star. Also, I have a flight from Chicago to Minneapolis 5 hours from now. And they have seats available on the earlier flight but won't give you without charging $75.

So confused because we fly a lot and there is always overhead storage or they place in under the cabin. So we asked a lady that was standing in the area of self print and she looked and our tickets said we would be fine... Again we were told wrong.
Donna of Orlando, FL," April 25, 2017","On September 4 my family of 5 arrived at the airport in Anchorage to fly home to Toronto via Dallas. Four of us had carry-on sized luggage but one had a mid-sized suitcase that we knew we would have to check. Our flight to Toronto included a 12.5-hour connection at DFW (not by choice). Since none of us sleep well on planes, we were considering going to a hotel following the overnight flight to DFW. When checking the suitcase, I specifically asked the American Airlines agent ""if we only check this bag to DFW and then go to a hotel for a few hours of sleep, will we be charged a second baggage fee to check the bag in for the flight to Toronto? If so we can rearrange the bags so that we can just check it through to Toronto."" "
Dan of London, Ontario," April 25, 2017","I purchased the basic economy ticket. When I was getting ready to board in Charlotte, the attendant mentioned that this was a new program for your airline and that customers have stated it was cost effective. However, this was not my case! I paid nearly $600 to fly from Columbus, OH to Asheville, NC. Absolutely absurd!!! In the future, I will do all I can to avoid flying with your airline and don't count on a positive recommendation from me to others! Also, stop charging for the first piece of checked in luggage!"

September 11 I checked the flight online and it was canceled. I called customer service. Patricia told me that I was wrong it wasn't cancel. I called at night again because I was worried I saw it was still cancel. After almost 2 hours they answered the phone. I told them what happened. They told me that they were very sorry but the flight was canceled and they didnt' have flight for Sept 12. They gave me 1 stop flight for Sept 13. "
Echo of Simi Valley, CA," April 24, 2017","I was scheduled to fly out of Tampa International on Sunday, September, 17th to Durango, CO. I live in Sarasota, and just returned home the other day after evacuating for Hurricane Irma. I fled Florida and headed to Georgia, where I had to rent a hotel for a few nights. When I returned home I was fortunate enough not to have suffered damage. I of course have yard debris strewn about and I am still without power. The power company has estimated by the end of the day on September 22nd I will have power. With the extra costs incurred from having to leave my home, and the loss of power, I decided this was not a good time to travel."
Shelly of Lafayette, CA," April 24, 2017","Hurricane Irma was mess for AA. I get it. I'm sure there were thousands who were stuck trying to get their flights changed. Unfortunately, I was in Costa Rica with a connection via Miami and I got, as the AA agent said ""the short end of the stick."" I would be stuck almost another week in Costa Rica as everything AA had was booked out or cancelled. I saw a little bit of silver lining when I found that if I could get to Mexico city, I could fly home via DFW. However, AA would not change the ticket as it is against their rules to change the country of origin on a ticket. ""We cannot do it."" However, a more accurate description is ""will not."""
Caroline of Pacific Beach, WA," April 24, 2017","We were delayed on our AA out of Seattle due to having to wait on flight crew. Managed to make it to Dallas on time BUT had to sit on the tarmac for 20 mins waiting for a gait in order to deplane. This caused to miss our connecting flight. Next available flight is the next day. Asked about compensation for overnight hotel stay (there are 7 in our party, including a 3 year old) and were denied due to the delay being coded as weather related, which is absolutely bogus. So livid, frustrated, and tired at this point. Also found out AA has no number to call for complaints... You have to go through email so who knows if they will even read it or reply. Will never fly AA again if I can help it."
Krzysztof of Garfield, NJ," April 22, 2017","I was on an almost 2 hour flight (Flight AA3936) stuck sitting with one leg over my bag and the other on the edge of the aisle. Not once was I asked to check in my bag nor told it wouldn't fit on the overhead bin. By the time we landed my knees, hips and back were killing me and I had to have help from the gentleman next to me to be able to stand up. So glad there wasn't an emergency 'cause this would have been one hell of a hazard. Lesson learned not to use this airline again."
Nancy of Apache Junction, AZ," April 22, 2017","American Airlines‰Û_the new standard for horrible service. Oh‰Û_I mean HORRIBLE! I travel very frequently for work and have stuck to one specific airline in order to build my status with them (ie. first class upgrades often, better seat choices, free checked bags). Recently, service has taken a turn for the worse. I‰Ûªm a reasonable guy and tolerate more than most. Call it my Southern hospitality, my upbringing or my service to the community when I served in law enforcement, but I just plain put up with more‰Û_until now."
LANCE of Cordova, TN," April 21, 2017","I travel 80%~ for Work and have flown with almost every airline multiple times. AA is by far the worst. Not due to their customer service/staff/delays or anything like that (at least that I‰Ûªve noticed), but their planes have no entertainment system on each seat, they do not play movies on the overhead screens, and they don‰Ûªt even have a free WiFi movie/tv option you can connect to using your phone! I‰Ûªm currently on a flight from Boston to Phoenix and was utterly shocked when I sat in my seat and noticed no form of entertainment for a cross-country flight. Delta and other airlines provide personal entertainment screens on each screen or a smartphone connect feature for 2+ hr flights, which in turn make the flights more enjoyable. Anyways, to avoid rambling on and on about the lack of technology on AA planes I‰Ûªll just say if you enjoyed traveling in the late 90s early 2000s, then AA is for you. If you want to travel in 2017 and beyond, find a different airline."
George of Dallas, OR," April 15, 2017","I had a horrible experience today on my flight back to Miami. I have been an AAdvantage member for many years now and have always chosen to be loyal to American but after today's experience that may change. The onboarding process was fine and the flight was on time, which to be honest is rare but I was happy. When the snacks and beverage cart came the attendant did not smile, looked unhappy to take our beverage order, handed me and my husband 2 cookies, I then I told her, ""Can we just get pretzels?"" She said ""Then I need the cookies back."" I was honestly appalled."
pat of Miami, FL," April 12, 2017","Don't deserve single star. Also, I have a flight from Chicago to Minneapolis 5 hours from now. And they have seats available on the earlier flight but won't give you without charging $75. They are ok to make you wait or fly a flight with empty seats but no customer delight which is no cost to them. No customer driven company and not looking for going extra mile to make customer happy. Never travel on American Airlines again."
Grace of Vail, AZ," April 12, 2017","Worst experience ever with AA never again, they treated my dad like garbage, they humiliated my dad in front of my niece travelling with him and in front of all passengers, just because my dad is ** and not fluent in English. I wish I could sue them for discrimination against my dad for not speaking English fluent instead of offering assistance in Spanish which, the sky harbor airport in Arizona has plenty of bilingual employees. DO NOT FLY AA EVER, pay more with a different airline. The only reason why my dad and niece flew AA to go to my brother's funeral, thank you AA for the worst day ever. It's a shame I have to put a star instead of no stars service."
ann of Co, CA," April 10, 2017","This American Airlines review is out of frustration due to a lot of things. They're a disgrace! The employees are rude, there is no leg room, no entertainment, and treat people like herds of sheep. They have a ""New"" rule where they charge $50 at the gate to carry on your luggage. Are you kidding me? $50 for a carry on? And I can't even use the overhead bin! Disgraceful! Basically these guys are crooks! They're a disgrace. Last time I flew with American their flight was delayed by 2 hours and we ended up missing our connecting flight because it was the last flight out. We ended up having to stay an extra day and had to pay $100 for a hotel. We missed my sisters wedding. On the way back we ended up stuck on the tarmac for 2 hours. Of course!"
Nghia of Rosemead, CA," April 10, 2017","I booked a ticket back when the hurricane were hitting down south every other week. Because of that I was not able to attend my trip in GA. They told me I had up to a year to use my ticket. So when I try to rebook my ticket they are now close to $500. Mind you this is the highest rate out of all the airlines for my particular dates, I asked for a refund because I didn't wanna double what I paid the first time and I was told by the Supervisor (Willie ** in Dallas ) that my only option was to ""use it or lost it"". Being a supervisor myself I thought the tone in which he said it was very careless and he didn't try to help the situation at all. I would never talk to my customers the way he spoke to me especially after losing out on $300!!"
Lucia of Providence, RI," April 7, 2017","I just completed a flight on American Airlines. I had read negative reviews, but I found the American Airlines people I had contact with were great, tried to provide all the service they could because our flight had been cancelled due WX and had to layover at ORD. My complaint is the phoney coupon given for a hotel room for a ""discounted rate"". The coupon has nothing to do with American Airlines, but is only a hotel booking service. When I called the phone number provided I was told the only available room was 10 miles away and given a rate of $80.00. It was getting late in the evening so took it. Then was advised there was a $15 service charge to book the room. American Airline paid none of this. The shuttle bus to the hotel was packed (Other delayed passengers). When I got home I checked the hotel rate and found the same room went for $105. I ""saved"" $10. The hotel was a Holiday Inn Express. Room not bad."

She made up some baloney about Homeland Security not letting people fly with spots on their passport. I told her I checked their website and there was no mention of anything like that. She then claimed, ""Oh, they don't tell you."" I said, ""Then how are you supposed to know?""

Nilgun of Pittsburgh, PA," April 6, 2017","Where do I even begin? I had a round trip flight booked from Toronto, Ontario to Busan, South Korea back in the month of July (2017). While I was away, I heard the news that my dad had passed away. In which, I contacted American Airlines right away and asked if anything can be done. I wanted to fly back before my actual trip date, due to obvious reasons. I even offered to provide them with a death certificate if need be (although, I don't think that is even something they should ask for right away). I spoke to 3 different customer service reps who were all horrible to speak with. They had zero compassion and empathy and just dismissed me as if what I was experiencing was far from a big deal to them. "
Catherine of Washington, DC," April 4, 2017","I was on the plane for 14 hours due to a delay. Sitting in a broken seat that would not recline. I told the stewardess and she could care less, said nothing she can do. After I got home I contacted the airline and they issued me a fourteen dollar credit. I had paid 197.34 dollars for preferred seats. The worst flight of my life, never again w/ this airline."
Ed of Fuquay Varing, NC," April 4, 2017","Overall, (Un)American Airlines continues to disappoint. I really only ever fly with AA as a last resort, and I can't see any reason to recommend traveling with AA. I was prior active duty Army, and now I'm a reservist, and only American Airlines makes me feel like my service is less important now. United, Southwest, Jet Blue, Delta, every other airline doesn't discriminate between Active Duty and Reserve/Guardsmen when it comes to bag fees. So, along with uncomfortable, outdated planes and poor service, I spent a $100 checking bags to and from my destination."
E of Sapphire, NC," April 3, 2017",American Airlines is the worst airlines to fly anywhere. They cram you in the seats with no leg room or any room for that matter. I requested a wheelchair at airport and waited 30 minutes upon someone finally arriving. They took me the wrong way to my next check in and I missed my flight. They said I would have to rebook my ticket and just wait for the next flight. Attendant at the gate was very disrespectful and not helpful at all. I had no control over this situation at all. Not to mention when I did finally arrive at my destination that I requested a wheelchair prior to my departure.
Gina of Chicago, IL," March 31, 2017","American Airlines is the worst airline in THE WORLD, and should change their name, it is utterly disgraceful that as an American they use this name. Their policy is to not apologize for anything, to be as rude as possible to people who are basically held hostage to them and their BS policies like closing the door to the gate while people are standing there then charging them money to rebook their flight, not caring at all about the bags on their way to a destination without the owners there to pick them up. Then being told when lodging a complaint that it was going in one ear and out the other. I have never been treated so poorly in my life, I will never again fly with this airline, I hope they go bankrupt and get the worst karma life can give. Oh yeah and I get to fly with them tomorrow. :/"
Denise of Jacksonville, FL," March 31, 2017","Very disappointed. Unlikely I will ever choose American Airlines again. I didn't make my flight in the spring. I was given a voucher to use for future travel. Now I'm being told I can only use it myself, and not for my family. I don't want to use it for myself. What difference does it make? I'm being told different things by different people. The last guy hung up on me and I wasn't even rude to him. This is how AA does business? All I want is to not be penalized for cancelling a flight that was beyond my control. If you have a voucher it should be flexible to use for anyone. AA is the WORST! Hope they go out of business for this nonsense. Airline travel is a joke."
Thomas of Plano, TX," March 30, 2017","American Airlines canceled my 92-year-old father-in-law's flight to Key West due to Hurricane Irma. On that day American Airline was contacted and the representative said there would be no problem re-booking, just use the reference number. American Airlines even went on TV and said they would waive re-booking fees. Today when calling to re-book the flight and after 57 minutes on the phone, I was told the flight could not be re-booked because it was in their notes I requested a refund. At no time did I request a refund and American Airlines could not locate any record of a refund request. Even so, American Airlines still insisted they could not re-book the flight or issue a refund. If we did not have enough trouble dealing with a Cat 4 hurricane and its devastating aftermath, now American Airlines is adding to the misery. All my father-in-law wants is to come to Key West and see that everyone is alright. Thanks, AA."
JEFFREY of Woodland Park, NJ," March 30, 2017",I bought tickets for my mother in law and son to meet my wife and I in Colorado. We had traveled on different airlines due to connections and therefore were going back on different airlines. My wife and I left on our airplane. My mother in law and son were stranded as the plane had a mechanical. This was 8 AM and the bottom line was it didn't get fixed that day. American gave them a 12.00 voucher good in the terminal and did nothing to get them a room as the rooms they usually used weren't available.
Kally of Lakeland, FL," March 29, 2017","I booked 2 separate flights on American Airlines in Economy since I pay for my air travel. On one they pre-assigned me a back-of-plane middle seat and said that I was required to pay some increased fee for window, aisle or closer to the front. On the second flight they said I have to wait until I reach the boarding gate for any seat. This is ridiculous and unacceptable. The airline has sufficient revenue to - just a suggestion - increase the ""base"" fare to cover a first-come-first-served seat selection and not put everyone into 3rd class or worse status. If they want to surcharge certain premium seats, like middle seats toward the front, that's OK, but this behavior is totally unacceptable and I refuse to fly them (or any airline) that abuses their passengers."
Michael of New Brunswick, NJ," March 29, 2017",Well I looked into changing my flight for my fiance and I to go home a day earlier... only to discover that American charges $200.00 a ticket PLUS the difference in price tickets!

I have already paid for a flight and now you are trying to rip me off even more!?! Out of touch and terrible service to a customer of over 5 years. I will be going elsewhere where I don't get bent over the table. Thank you American!

Bill of Las Vegas, NV," March 3, 2017","Where do I even begin? I had a round trip flight booked from Toronto, Ontario to Busan, South Korea back in the month of July (2017). While I was away, I heard the news that my dad had passed away. In which, I contacted American Airlines right away and asked if anything can be done. I wanted to fly back before my actual trip date, due to obvious reasons. I even offered to provide them with a death certificate if need be (although, I don't think that is even something they should ask for right away). I spoke to 3 different customer service reps who were all horrible to speak with. They had zero compassion and empathy and just dismissed me as if what I was experiencing was far from a big deal to them. "
Meghan of Little Rock, AR," March 2, 2017","I was on the plane for 14 hours due to a delay. Sitting in a broken seat that would not recline. I told the stewardess and she could care less, said nothing she can do. After I got home I contacted the airline and they issued me a fourteen dollar credit. I had paid 197.34 dollars for preferred seats. The worst flight of my life, never again w/ this airline."
Jasmine of Clarksville, TN," March 1, 2017","Overall, (Un)American Airlines continues to disappoint. I really only ever fly with AA as a last resort, and I can't see any reason to recommend traveling with AA. I was prior active duty Army, and now I'm a reservist, and only American Airlines makes me feel like my service is less important now. United, Southwest, Jet Blue, Delta, every other airline doesn't discriminate between Active Duty and Reserve/Guardsmen when it comes to bag fees. So, along with uncomfortable, outdated planes and poor service, I spent a $100 checking bags to and from my destination."
BreAnna of Cedar Creek, TX," Feb. 23, 2017",American Airlines is the worst airlines to fly anywhere. They cram you in the seats with no leg room or any room for that matter. I requested a wheelchair at airport and waited 30 minutes upon someone finally arriving. They took me the wrong way to my next check in and I missed my flight. They said I would have to rebook my ticket and just wait for the next flight. Attendant at the gate was very disrespectful and not helpful at all. I had no control over this situation at all. Not to mention when I did finally arrive at my destination that I requested a wheelchair prior to my departure.
Michael of Raleigh, NC," Feb. 22, 2017","American Airlines is the worst airline in THE WORLD, and should change their name, it is utterly disgraceful that as an American they use this name. Their policy is to not apologize for anything, to be as rude as possible to people who are basically held hostage to them and their BS policies like closing the door to the gate while people are standing there then charging them money to rebook their flight, not caring at all about the bags on their way to a destination without the owners there to pick them up. Then being told when lodging a complaint that it was going in one ear and out the other. I have never been treated so poorly in my life, I will never again fly with this airline, I hope they go bankrupt and get the worst karma life can give. Oh yeah and I get to fly with them tomorrow. :/"
Omar of Plano, TX," Feb. 20, 2017","Very disappointed. Unlikely I will ever choose American Airlines again. I didn't make my flight in the spring. I was given a voucher to use for future travel. Now I'm being told I can only use it myself, and not for my family. I don't want to use it for myself. What difference does it make? I'm being told different things by different people. The last guy hung up on me and I wasn't even rude to him. This is how AA does business? All I want is to not be penalized for cancelling a flight that was beyond my control. If you have a voucher it should be flexible to use for anyone. AA is the WORST! Hope they go out of business for this nonsense. Airline travel is a joke."
Tami of Phoenix, AZ," Feb. 16, 2017","American Airlines canceled my 92-year-old father-in-law's flight to Key West due to Hurricane Irma. On that day American Airline was contacted and the representative said there would be no problem re-booking, just use the reference number. American Airlines even went on TV and said they would waive re-booking fees. Today when calling to re-book the flight and after 57 minutes on the phone, I was told the flight could not be re-booked because it was in their notes I requested a refund. At no time did I request a refund and American Airlines could not locate any record of a refund request. Even so, American Airlines still insisted they could not re-book the flight or issue a refund. If we did not have enough trouble dealing with a Cat 4 hurricane and its devastating aftermath, now American Airlines is adding to the misery. All my father-in-law wants is to come to Key West and see that everyone is alright. Thanks, AA."
Carlos of Doral, FL," Feb. 13, 2017",I bought tickets for my mother in law and son to meet my wife and I in Colorado. We had traveled on different airlines due to connections and therefore were going back on different airlines. My wife and I left on our airplane. My mother in law and son were stranded as the plane had a mechanical. This was 8 AM and the bottom line was it didn't get fixed that day. American gave them a 12.00 voucher good in the terminal and did nothing to get them a room as the rooms they usually used weren't available.
Greg of Glassboro, NJ," Feb. 8, 2017","I booked 2 separate flights on American Airlines in Economy since I pay for my air travel. On one they pre-assigned me a back-of-plane middle seat and said that I was required to pay some increased fee for window, aisle or closer to the front. On the second flight they said I have to wait until I reach the boarding gate for any seat. This is ridiculous and unacceptable. The airline has sufficient revenue to - just a suggestion - increase the ""base"" fare to cover a first-come-first-served seat selection and not put everyone into 3rd class or worse status. If they want to surcharge certain premium seats, like middle seats toward the front, that's OK, but this behavior is totally unacceptable and I refuse to fly them (or any airline) that abuses their passengers."
Marcelo of Garland, TX," Feb. 6, 2017",Well I looked into changing my flight for my fiance and I to go home a day earlier... only to discover that American charges $200.00 a ticket PLUS the difference in price tickets! LIKE THAT IS GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE! So for the price of another ticket I can change my flight! I will be looking elsewhere for flights in the future. I have already paid for a flight and now you are trying to rip me off even more!?! Out of touch and terrible service to a customer of over 5 years. I will be going elsewhere where I don't get bent over the table. Thank you American!
P of Wheaton, IL," Feb. 5, 2017","I originally booked my flight to Miami from Washington, DC back in July 2017. I was scheduled to fly September 13-18, 2017.

I was informed by two customer service representatives that I would be able to rebook my flight to Miami with no additional charges in fare and no change fees. Of course, when it comes time to book my flight, I'm informed about a change fee. I told the agent, I was reassured twice that I would not be charged any additional fees because my initial cancellation was weather related. "
William of Big Bend, CA," Feb. 4, 2017","American Airlines is full of **. Our cruise was cancelled due to Hurricane Irma. It was beyond our control and the airline stated there was nothing that they could do. No partial credit, changes or anything! I will not be flying with them anymore!"
Darren of San Tan Valley, AZ," Feb. 3, 2017",My husband and I were scheduled to fly out at 7:15 am to go to California for a very important family matter. We do not live near the airport so we were up early to make sure we were early and nothing could go wrong. But things did go wrong. When we got to the airport we went and printed out tickets at the self checkout. We did notice that it mentioned no overhead storage for our carry on bags. So confused because we fly a lot and there is always overhead storage or they place in under the cabin. So we asked a lady that was standing in the area of self print and she looked and our tickets said we would be fine... Again we were told wrong.
Rachel of London, Other," Jan. 29, 2017","On September 4 my family of 5 arrived at the airport in Anchorage to fly home to Toronto via Dallas. Four of us had carry-on sized luggage but one had a mid-sized suitcase that we knew we would have to check. Our flight to Toronto included a 12.5-hour connection at DFW (not by choice). Since none of us sleep well on planes, we were considering going to a hotel following the overnight flight to DFW. When checking the suitcase, I specifically asked the American Airlines agent ""if we only check this bag to DFW and then go to a hotel for a few hours of sleep, will we be charged a second baggage fee to check the bag in for the flight to Toronto? If so we can rearrange the bags so that we can just check it through to Toronto."" "

In the future, I will do all I can to avoid flying with your airline and don't count on a positive recommendation from me to others! Also, stop charging for the first piece of checked in luggage!"

I called at night again because I was worried I saw it was still cancel. After almost 2 hours they answered the phone. I told them what happened. They told me that they were very sorry but the flight was canceled and they didnt' have flight for Sept 12. They gave me 1 stop flight for Sept 13. "
Richard of Escondido, CA," Jan. 26, 2017","I was scheduled to fly out of Tampa International on Sunday, September, 17th to Durango, CO. I live in Sarasota, and just returned home the other day after evacuating for Hurricane Irma. I fled Florida and headed to Georgia, where I had to rent a hotel for a few nights. When I returned home I was fortunate enough not to have suffered damage. I of course have yard debris strewn about and I am still without power. The power company has estimated by the end of the day on September 22nd I will have power. With the extra costs incurred from having to leave my home, and the loss of power, I decided this was not a good time to travel."
Gwendolyn of Cameron Mills, NY," Jan. 25, 2017","Hurricane Irma was mess for AA. I get it. I'm sure there were thousands who were stuck trying to get their flights changed. Unfortunately, I was in Costa Rica with a connection via Miami and I got, as the AA agent said ""the short end of the stick."" I would be stuck almost another week in Costa Rica as everything AA had was booked out or cancelled. I saw a little bit of silver lining when I found that if I could get to Mexico city, I could fly home via DFW. However, AA would not change the ticket as it is against their rules to change the country of origin on a ticket. ""We cannot do it."" However, a more accurate description is ""will not."""
Ndeye of Buffalo Ny, NY," Jan. 23, 2017","We were delayed on our AA out of Seattle due to having to wait on flight crew. Managed to make it to Dallas on time BUT had to sit on the tarmac for 20 mins waiting for a gait in order to deplane. This caused to miss our connecting flight. Next available flight is the next day. Asked about compensation for overnight hotel stay (there are 7 in our party, including a 3 year old) and were denied due to the delay being coded as weather related, which is absolutely bogus. So livid, frustrated, and tired at this point. Also found out AA has no number to call for complaints... You have to go through email so who knows if they will even read it or reply. Will never fly AA again if I can help it."
Harpreet of Mcdonough, GA," Jan. 23, 2017","I was on an almost 2 hour flight (Flight AA3936) stuck sitting with one leg over my bag and the other on the edge of the aisle. Not once was I asked to check in my bag nor told it wouldn't fit on the overhead bin. By the time we landed my knees, hips and back were killing me and I had to have help from the gentleman next to me to be able to stand up. So glad there wasn't an emergency 'cause this would have been one hell of a hazard. Lesson learned not to use this airline again."
Angela of Swords, Other," Jan. 22, 2017","American Airlines‰Û_the new standard for horrible service. Oh‰Û_I mean HORRIBLE! I travel very frequently for work and have stuck to one specific airline in order to build my status with them (ie. first class upgrades often, better seat choices, free checked bags). Recently, service has taken a turn for the worse. I‰Ûªm a reasonable guy and tolerate more than most. Call it my Southern hospitality, my upbringing or my service to the community when I served in law enforcement, but I just plain put up with more‰Û_until now."
nicholas of Spanaway, WA," Jan. 22, 2017","I travel 80%~ for Work and have flown with almost every airline multiple times. AA is by far the worst. Not due to their customer service/staff/delays or anything like that (at least that I‰Ûªve noticed), but their planes have no entertainment system on each seat, they do not play movies on the overhead screens, and they don‰Ûªt even have a free WiFi movie/tv option you can connect to using your phone! I‰Ûªm currently on a flight from Boston to Phoenix and was utterly shocked when I sat in my seat and noticed no form of entertainment for a cross-country flight. Delta and other airlines provide personal entertainment screens on each screen or a smartphone connect feature for 2+ hr flights, which in turn make the flights more enjoyable. Anyways, to avoid rambling on and on about the lack of technology on AA planes I‰Ûªll just say if you enjoyed traveling in the late 90s early 2000s, then AA is for you. If you want to travel in 2017 and beyond, find a different airline."
Hans of Hialeah, FL," Jan. 21, 2017","I had a horrible experience today on my flight back to Miami. I have been an AAdvantage member for many years now and have always chosen to be loyal to American but after today's experience that may change. The onboarding process was fine and the flight was on time, which to be honest is rare but I was happy. When the snacks and beverage cart came the attendant did not smile, looked unhappy to take our beverage order, handed me and my husband 2 cookies, I then I told her, ""Can we just get pretzels?"" She said ""Then I need the cookies back."" I was honestly appalled."
Robert of Mckinney, TX," Jan. 21, 2017","Don't deserve single star. Also, I have a flight from Chicago to Minneapolis 5 hours from now. And they have seats available on the earlier flight but won't give you without charging $75. They are ok to make you wait or fly a flight with empty seats but no customer delight which is no cost to them. No customer driven company and not looking for going extra mile to make customer happy. Never travel on American Airlines again."
sandi of Montville, NJ," Jan. 20, 2017","Worst experience ever with AA never again, they treated my dad like garbage, they humiliated my dad in front of my niece travelling with him and in front of all passengers, just because my dad is ** and not fluent in English. I wish I could sue them for discrimination against my dad for not speaking English fluent instead of offering assistance in Spanish which, the sky harbor airport in Arizona has plenty of bilingual employees. DO NOT FLY AA EVER, pay more with a different airline. The only reason why my dad and niece flew AA to go to my brother's funeral, thank you AA for the worst day ever. It's a shame I have to put a star instead of no stars service."
andria of High Wycombe, Other," Jan. 20, 2017","This American Airlines review is out of frustration due to a lot of things. They're a disgrace! The employees are rude, there is no leg room, no entertainment, and treat people like herds of sheep. They have a ""New"" rule where they charge $50 at the gate to carry on your luggage. Are you kidding me? $50 for a carry on? And I can't even use the overhead bin! Disgraceful! Basically these guys are crooks! They're a disgrace. Last time I flew with American their flight was delayed by 2 hours and we ended up missing our connecting flight because it was the last flight out. We ended up having to stay an extra day and had to pay $100 for a hotel. We missed my sisters wedding. On the way back we ended up stuck on the tarmac for 2 hours. Of course!"
Port of Miami, FL," Jan. 17, 2017","I booked a ticket back when the hurricane were hitting down south every other week. Because of that I was not able to attend my trip in GA. They told me I had up to a year to use my ticket. So when I try to rebook my ticket they are now close to $500. Mind you this is the highest rate out of all the airlines for my particular dates, I asked for a refund because I didn't wanna double what I paid the first time and I was told by the Supervisor (Willie ** in Dallas ) that my only option was to ""use it or lost it"". Being a supervisor myself I thought the tone in which he said it was very careless and he didn't try to help the situation at all. I would never talk to my customers the way he spoke to me especially after losing out on $300!!"
Larry of Prairie City, IL," Jan. 17, 2017","I just completed a flight on American Airlines. I had read negative reviews, but I found the American Airlines people I had contact with were great, tried to provide all the service they could because our flight had been cancelled due WX and had to layover at ORD. My complaint is the phoney coupon given for a hotel room for a ""discounted rate"". The coupon has nothing to do with American Airlines, but is only a hotel booking service. When I called the phone number provided I was told the only available room was 10 miles away and given a rate of $80.00. It was getting late in the evening so took it. Then was advised there was a $15 service charge to book the room. American Airline paid none of this. The shuttle bus to the hotel was packed (Other delayed passengers). When I got home I checked the hotel rate and found the same room went for $105. I ""saved"" $10. The hotel was a Holiday Inn Express. Room not bad."

She made up some baloney about Homeland Security not letting people fly with spots on their passport. I told her I checked their website and there was no mention of anything like that. She then claimed, ""Oh, they don't tell you."" I said, ""Then how are you supposed to know?""

However, AA would not change the ticket as it is against their rules to change the country of origin on a ticket. ""We cannot do it."" However, a more accurate description is ""will not."""
R. of Roanoke, IN," Dec. 28, 2016","We were delayed on our AA out of Seattle due to having to wait on flight crew. Managed to make it to Dallas on time BUT had to sit on the tarmac for 20 mins waiting for a gait in order to deplane. This caused to miss our connecting flight. Next available flight is the next day. Asked about compensation for overnight hotel stay (there are 7 in our party, including a 3 year old) and were denied due to the delay being coded as weather related, which is absolutely bogus. So livid, frustrated, and tired at this point. Also found out AA has no number to call for complaints... You have to go through email so who knows if they will even read it or reply. Will never fly AA again if I can help it."
Kevin of Chambersburg, PA," Dec. 27, 2016","I was on an almost 2 hour flight (Flight AA3936) stuck sitting with one leg over my bag and the other on the edge of the aisle. Not once was I asked to check in my bag nor told it wouldn't fit on the overhead bin. By the time we landed my knees, hips and back were killing me and I had to have help from the gentleman next to me to be able to stand up. So glad there wasn't an emergency 'cause this would have been one hell of a hazard. Lesson learned not to use this airline again."
Kim of Santa Barbara, CA," Dec. 27, 2016","American Airlines‰Û_the new standard for horrible service. Oh‰Û_I mean HORRIBLE! I travel very frequently for work and have stuck to one specific airline in order to build my status with them (ie. first class upgrades often, better seat choices, free checked bags). Recently, service has taken a turn for the worse. I‰Ûªm a reasonable guy and tolerate more than most. Call it my Southern hospitality, my upbringing or my service to the community when I served in law enforcement, but I just plain put up with more‰Û_until now."
R. of Coconut Creek, FL," Dec. 26, 2016","I travel 80%~ for Work and have flown with almost every airline multiple times. AA is by far the worst. Not due to their customer service/staff/delays or anything like that (at least that I‰Ûªve noticed), but their planes have no entertainment system on each seat, they do not play movies on the overhead screens, and they don‰Ûªt even have a free WiFi movie/tv option you can connect to using your phone! I‰Ûªm currently on a flight from Boston to Phoenix and was utterly shocked when I sat in my seat and noticed no form of entertainment for a cross-country flight. Delta and other airlines provide personal entertainment screens on each screen or a smartphone connect feature for 2+ hr flights, which in turn make the flights more enjoyable. Anyways, to avoid rambling on and on about the lack of technology on AA planes I‰Ûªll just say if you enjoyed traveling in the late 90s early 2000s, then AA is for you. If you want to travel in 2017 and beyond, find a different airline."
Laurie of Blacksburg, VA," Dec. 25, 2016","I had a horrible experience today on my flight back to Miami. I have been an AAdvantage member for many years now and have always chosen to be loyal to American but after today's experience that may change. The onboarding process was fine and the flight was on time, which to be honest is rare but I was happy. When the snacks and beverage cart came the attendant did not smile, looked unhappy to take our beverage order, handed me and my husband 2 cookies, I then I told her, ""Can we just get pretzels?"" She said ""Then I need the cookies back."" I was honestly appalled."
Marleen of Medford, NJ," Dec. 25, 2016","Don't deserve single star. Also, I have a flight from Chicago to Minneapolis 5 hours from now. And they have seats available on the earlier flight but won't give you without charging $75. They are ok to make you wait or fly a flight with empty seats but no customer delight which is no cost to them. No customer driven company and not looking for going extra mile to make customer happy. Never travel on American Airlines again."
L. H. of Davis, CA," Dec. 24, 2016","Worst experience ever with AA never again, they treated my dad like garbage, they humiliated my dad in front of my niece travelling with him and in front of all passengers, just because my dad is ** and not fluent in English. I wish I could sue them for discrimination against my dad for not speaking English fluent instead of offering assistance in Spanish which, the sky harbor airport in Arizona has plenty of bilingual employees. DO NOT FLY AA EVER, pay more with a different airline. The only reason why my dad and niece flew AA to go to my brother's funeral, thank you AA for the worst day ever. It's a shame I have to put a star instead of no stars service."
Carolina of East Elmhurst, NY," Dec. 23, 2016","This American Airlines review is out of frustration due to a lot of things. They're a disgrace! The employees are rude, there is no leg room, no entertainment, and treat people like herds of sheep. They have a ""New"" rule where they charge $50 at the gate to carry on your luggage. Are you kidding me? $50 for a carry on? And I can't even use the overhead bin! Disgraceful! Basically these guys are crooks! They're a disgrace. Last time I flew with American their flight was delayed by 2 hours and we ended up missing our connecting flight because it was the last flight out. We ended up having to stay an extra day and had to pay $100 for a hotel. We missed my sisters wedding. On the way back we ended up stuck on the tarmac for 2 hours. Of course!"
S. of San Francisco, California," Dec. 23, 2016","I booked a ticket back when the hurricane were hitting down south every other week. Because of that I was not able to attend my trip in GA. They told me I had up to a year to use my ticket. So when I try to rebook my ticket they are now close to $500. Mind you this is the highest rate out of all the airlines for my particular dates, I asked for a refund because I didn't wanna double what I paid the first time and I was told by the Supervisor (Willie ** in Dallas ) that my only option was to ""use it or lost it"". Being a supervisor myself I thought the tone in which he said it was very careless and he didn't try to help the situation at all. I would never talk to my customers the way he spoke to me especially after losing out on $300!!"
Bonnie of Lone Rock, WI," Dec. 22, 2016","I just completed a flight on American Airlines. I had read negative reviews, but I found the American Airlines people I had contact with were great, tried to provide all the service they could because our flight had been cancelled due WX and had to layover at ORD. My complaint is the phoney coupon given for a hotel room for a ""discounted rate"". The coupon has nothing to do with American Airlines, but is only a hotel booking service. When I called the phone number provided I was told the only available room was 10 miles away and given a rate of $80.00. It was getting late in the evening so took it. Then was advised there was a $15 service charge to book the room. American Airline paid none of this. The shuttle bus to the hotel was packed (Other delayed passengers). When I got home I checked the hotel rate and found the same room went for $105. I ""saved"" $10. The hotel was a Holiday Inn Express. Room not bad."

She made up some baloney about Homeland Security not letting people fly with spots on their passport. I told her I checked their website and there was no mention of anything like that. She then claimed, ""Oh, they don't tell you."" I said, ""Then how are you supposed to know?""

While I was away, I heard the news that my dad had passed away. In which, I contacted American Airlines right away and asked if anything can be done. I wanted to fly back before my actual trip date, due to obvious reasons. I even offered to provide them with a death certificate if need be (although, I don't think that is even something they should ask for right away). I spoke to 3 different customer service reps who were all horrible to speak with. They had zero compassion and empathy and just dismissed me as if what I was experiencing was far from a big deal to them. "

I told the stewardess and she could care less, said nothing she can do. After I got home I contacted the airline and they issued me a fourteen dollar credit. I had paid 197.34 dollars for preferred seats. The worst flight of my life, never again w/ this airline."
Elizabeth of Chesterfield, MO," Dec. 21, 2016","Overall, (Un)American Airlines continues to disappoint. I really only ever fly with AA as a last resort, and I can't see any reason to recommend traveling with AA. I was prior active duty Army, and now I'm a reservist, and only American Airlines makes me feel like my service is less important now. United, Southwest, Jet Blue, Delta, every other airline doesn't discriminate between Active Duty and Reserve/Guardsmen when it comes to bag fees. So, along with uncomfortable, outdated planes and poor service, I spent a $100 checking bags to and from my destination."
Danny of Collegedale, TN," Dec. 21, 2016",American Airlines is the worst airlines to fly anywhere. They cram you in the seats with no leg room or any room for that matter. I requested a wheelchair at airport and waited 30 minutes upon someone finally arriving. They took me the wrong way to my next check in and I missed my flight. They said I would have to rebook my ticket and just wait for the next flight. Attendant at the gate was very disrespectful and not helpful at all. I had no control over this situation at all. Not to mention when I did finally arrive at my destination that I requested a wheelchair prior to my departure.
Catherine of Carmichael, CA," Dec. 21, 2016","American Airlines is the worst airline in THE WORLD, and should change their name, it is utterly disgraceful that as an American they use this name. Their policy is to not apologize for anything, to be as rude as possible to people who are basically held hostage to them and their BS policies like closing the door to the gate while people are standing there then charging them money to rebook their flight, not caring at all about the bags on their way to a destination without the owners there to pick them up. Then being told when lodging a complaint that it was going in one ear and out the other. I have never been treated so poorly in my life, I will never again fly with this airline, I hope they go bankrupt and get the worst karma life can give. Oh yeah and I get to fly with them tomorrow. :/"
Christine of Bloomington, IN," Dec. 19, 2016","Very disappointed. Unlikely I will ever choose American Airlines again. I didn't make my flight in the spring. I was given a voucher to use for future travel. Now I'm being told I can only use it myself, and not for my family. I don't want to use it for myself. What difference does it make? I'm being told different things by different people. The last guy hung up on me and I wasn't even rude to him. This is how AA does business? All I want is to not be penalized for cancelling a flight that was beyond my control. If you have a voucher it should be flexible to use for anyone. AA is the WORST! Hope they go out of business for this nonsense. Airline travel is a joke."
Richard of Jonesboro, AR," Dec. 19, 2016","American Airlines canceled my 92-year-old father-in-law's flight to Key West due to Hurricane Irma. On that day American Airline was contacted and the representative said there would be no problem re-booking, just use the reference number. American Airlines even went on TV and said they would waive re-booking fees. Today when calling to re-book the flight and after 57 minutes on the phone, I was told the flight could not be re-booked because it was in their notes I requested a refund. At no time did I request a refund and American Airlines could not locate any record of a refund request. Even so, American Airlines still insisted they could not re-book the flight or issue a refund. If we did not have enough trouble dealing with a Cat 4 hurricane and its devastating aftermath, now American Airlines is adding to the misery. All my father-in-law wants is to come to Key West and see that everyone is alright. Thanks, AA."
Armando of Key Biscayne, FL," Dec. 18, 2016",I bought tickets for my mother in law and son to meet my wife and I in Colorado. We had traveled on different airlines due to connections and therefore were going back on different airlines. My wife and I left on our airplane. My mother in law and son were stranded as the plane had a mechanical. This was 8 AM and the bottom line was it didn't get fixed that day. American gave them a 12.00 voucher good in the terminal and did nothing to get them a room as the rooms they usually used weren't available.
Kathrine of Milford, PA," Dec. 17, 2016","I booked 2 separate flights on American Airlines in Economy since I pay for my air travel. On one they pre-assigned me a back-of-plane middle seat and said that I was required to pay some increased fee for window, aisle or closer to the front. On the second flight they said I have to wait until I reach the boarding gate for any seat. This is ridiculous and unacceptable. The airline has sufficient revenue to - just a suggestion - increase the ""base"" fare to cover a first-come-first-served seat selection and not put everyone into 3rd class or worse status. If they want to surcharge certain premium seats, like middle seats toward the front, that's OK, but this behavior is totally unacceptable and I refuse to fly them (or any airline) that abuses their passengers."
Don of El Granada, CA," Dec. 16, 2016",Well I looked into changing my flight for my fiance and I to go home a day earlier... only to discover that American charges $200.00 a ticket PLUS the difference in price tickets! LIKE THAT IS GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE! So for the price of another ticket I can change my flight! I will be looking elsewhere for flights in the future. I have already paid for a flight and now you are trying to rip me off even more!?! Out of touch and terrible service to a customer of over 5 years. I will be going elsewhere where I don't get bent over the table. Thank you American!
Robert of Kalamazoo, MI," Dec. 16, 2016","I originally booked my flight to Miami from Washington, DC back in July 2017. I was scheduled to fly September 13-18, 2017. I, like many, had to cancel my trip because of hurricane Irma. I was informed by two customer service representatives that I would be able to rebook my flight to Miami with no additional charges in fare and no change fees. Of course, when it comes time to book my flight, I'm informed about a change fee. I told the agent, I was reassured twice that I would not be charged any additional fees because my initial cancellation was weather related. "
Jacqui of Ocala, FL," Dec. 14, 2016","American Airlines is full of **. Our cruise was cancelled due to Hurricane Irma. It was beyond our control and the airline stated there was nothing that they could do. No partial credit, changes or anything! I will not be flying with them anymore!"
Angely of Mint Hill, NC," Dec. 13, 2016",My husband and I were scheduled to fly out at 7:15 am to go to California for a very important family matter. We do not live near the airport so we were up early to make sure we were early and nothing could go wrong. But things did go wrong. When we got to the airport we went and printed out tickets at the self checkout. We did notice that it mentioned no overhead storage for our carry on bags. So confused because we fly a lot and there is always overhead storage or they place in under the cabin. So we asked a lady that was standing in the area of self print and she looked and our tickets said we would be fine... Again we were told wrong.
Rick of Mebane, NC," Dec. 11, 2016","On September 4 my family of 5 arrived at the airport in Anchorage to fly home to Toronto via Dallas. Four of us had carry-on sized luggage but one had a mid-sized suitcase that we knew we would have to check. Our flight to Toronto included a 12.5-hour connection at DFW (not by choice). Since none of us sleep well on planes, we were considering going to a hotel following the overnight flight to DFW. When checking the suitcase, I specifically asked the American Airlines agent ""if we only check this bag to DFW and then go to a hotel for a few hours of sleep, will we be charged a second baggage fee to check the bag in for the flight to Toronto? If so we can rearrange the bags so that we can just check it through to Toronto."" "
Diane of San Diego, CA," Dec. 9, 2016","I purchased the basic economy ticket. When I was getting ready to board in Charlotte, the attendant mentioned that this was a new program for your airline and that customers have stated it was cost effective. However, this was not my case! I paid nearly $600 to fly from Columbus, OH to Asheville, NC. Absolutely absurd!!! In the future, I will do all I can to avoid flying with your airline and don't count on a positive recommendation from me to others! Also, stop charging for the first piece of checked in luggage!"

I called at night again because I was worried I saw it was still cancel. After almost 2 hours they answered the phone. I told them what happened. They told me that they were very sorry but the flight was canceled and they didnt' have flight for Sept 12. They gave me 1 stop flight for Sept 13. "

When I returned home I was fortunate enough not to have suffered damage. I of course have yard debris strewn about and I am still without power. The power company has estimated by the end of the day on September 22nd I will have power. With the extra costs incurred from having to leave my home, and the loss of power, I decided this was not a good time to travel."

Annette of La Grange, IL," Oct. 29, 2016","Very disappointed. Unlikely I will ever choose American Airlines again. I didn't make my flight in the spring. I was given a voucher to use for future travel. Now I'm being told I can only use it myself, and not for my family. I don't want to use it for myself. What difference does it make? I'm being told different things by different people. The last guy hung up on me and I wasn't even rude to him. This is how AA does business? All I want is to not be penalized for cancelling a flight that was beyond my control. If you have a voucher it should be flexible to use for anyone. AA is the WORST! Hope they go out of business for this nonsense. Airline travel is a joke."
Ed of Mickleton, NJ," Oct. 27, 2016","American Airlines canceled my 92-year-old father-in-law's flight to Key West due to Hurricane Irma. On that day American Airline was contacted and the representative said there would be no problem re-booking, just use the reference number. American Airlines even went on TV and said they would waive re-booking fees. Today when calling to re-book the flight and after 57 minutes on the phone, I was told the flight could not be re-booked because it was in their notes I requested a refund. At no time did I request a refund and American Airlines could not locate any record of a refund request. Even so, American Airlines still insisted they could not re-book the flight or issue a refund. If we did not have enough trouble dealing with a Cat 4 hurricane and its devastating aftermath, now American Airlines is adding to the misery. All my father-in-law wants is to come to Key West and see that everyone is alright. Thanks, AA."
Paul of Fort Pierce, FL," Oct. 26, 2016",I bought tickets for my mother in law and son to meet my wife and I in Colorado. We had traveled on different airlines due to connections and therefore were going back on different airlines. My wife and I left on our airplane. My mother in law and son were stranded as the plane had a mechanical. This was 8 AM and the bottom line was it didn't get fixed that day. American gave them a 12.00 voucher good in the terminal and did nothing to get them a room as the rooms they usually used weren't available.
Andrew of Palm Coast, FL," Oct. 25, 2016","I booked 2 separate flights on American Airlines in Economy since I pay for my air travel. On one they pre-assigned me a back-of-plane middle seat and said that I was required to pay some increased fee for window, aisle or closer to the front. On the second flight they said I have to wait until I reach the boarding gate for any seat. This is ridiculous and unacceptable. The airline has sufficient revenue to - just a suggestion - increase the ""base"" fare to cover a first-come-first-served seat selection and not put everyone into 3rd class or worse status. If they want to surcharge certain premium seats, like middle seats toward the front, that's OK, but this behavior is totally unacceptable and I refuse to fly them (or any airline) that abuses their passengers."
Lee of Temple City, CA," Oct. 24, 2016",Well I looked into changing my flight for my fiance and I to go home a day earlier... only to discover that American charges $200.00 a ticket PLUS the difference in price tickets! LIKE THAT IS GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE! So for the price of another ticket I can change my flight! I will be looking elsewhere for flights in the future. I have already paid for a flight and now you are trying to rip me off even more!?! Out of touch and terrible service to a customer of over 5 years. I will be going elsewhere where I don't get bent over the table. Thank you American!

I was informed by two customer service representatives that I would be able to rebook my flight to Miami with no additional charges in fare and no change fees. Of course, when it comes time to book my flight, I'm informed about a change fee. I told the agent, I was reassured twice that I would not be charged any additional fees because my initial cancellation was weather related. "
Sherri of Diamond Springs, CA," Oct. 22, 2016","American Airlines is full of **. Our cruise was cancelled due to Hurricane Irma. It was beyond our control and the airline stated there was nothing that they could do. No partial credit, changes or anything! I will not be flying with them anymore!"
Jesus J of Austin, TX," Oct. 22, 2016",My husband and I were scheduled to fly out at 7:15 am to go to California for a very important family matter. We do not live near the airport so we were up early to make sure we were early and nothing could go wrong. But things did go wrong. When we got to the airport we went and printed out tickets at the self checkout. We did notice that it mentioned no overhead storage for our carry on bags. So confused because we fly a lot and there is always overhead storage or they place in under the cabin. So we asked a lady that was standing in the area of self print and she looked and our tickets said we would be fine... Again we were told wrong.
Stephen of Sydney, Other," Oct. 21, 2016","On September 4 my family of 5 arrived at the airport in Anchorage to fly home to Toronto via Dallas. Four of us had carry-on sized luggage but one had a mid-sized suitcase that we knew we would have to check. Our flight to Toronto included a 12.5-hour connection at DFW (not by choice). Since none of us sleep well on planes, we were considering going to a hotel following the overnight flight to DFW. When checking the suitcase, I specifically asked the American Airlines agent ""if we only check this bag to DFW and then go to a hotel for a few hours of sleep, will we be charged a second baggage fee to check the bag in for the flight to Toronto? If so we can rearrange the bags so that we can just check it through to Toronto."" "

In the future, I will do all I can to avoid flying with your airline and don't count on a positive recommendation from me to others! Also, stop charging for the first piece of checked in luggage!"

I called at night again because I was worried I saw it was still cancel. After almost 2 hours they answered the phone. I told them what happened. They told me that they were very sorry but the flight was canceled and they didnt' have flight for Sept 12. They gave me 1 stop flight for Sept 13. "
Juan of San Jose, CA," Oct. 19, 2016","I was scheduled to fly out of Tampa International on Sunday, September, 17th to Durango, CO. I live in Sarasota, and just returned home the other day after evacuating for Hurricane Irma. I fled Florida and headed to Georgia, where I had to rent a hotel for a few nights. When I returned home I was fortunate enough not to have suffered damage. I of course have yard debris strewn about and I am still without power. The power company has estimated by the end of the day on September 22nd I will have power. With the extra costs incurred from having to leave my home, and the loss of power, I decided this was not a good time to travel."
Bond of Wake Forest, NC," Oct. 15, 2016","Hurricane Irma was mess for AA. I get it. I'm sure there were thousands who were stuck trying to get their flights changed. Unfortunately, I was in Costa Rica with a connection via Miami and I got, as the AA agent said ""the short end of the stick."" I would be stuck almost another week in Costa Rica as everything AA had was booked out or cancelled. I saw a little bit of silver lining when I found that if I could get to Mexico city, I could fly home via DFW. However, AA would not change the ticket as it is against their rules to change the country of origin on a ticket. ""We cannot do it."" However, a more accurate description is ""will not."""
Janice of Port Townsend, WA," Oct. 14, 2016","We were delayed on our AA out of Seattle due to having to wait on flight crew. Managed to make it to Dallas on time BUT had to sit on the tarmac for 20 mins waiting for a gait in order to deplane. This caused to miss our connecting flight. Next available flight is the next day. Asked about compensation for overnight hotel stay (there are 7 in our party, including a 3 year old) and were denied due to the delay being coded as weather related, which is absolutely bogus. So livid, frustrated, and tired at this point. Also found out AA has no number to call for complaints... You have to go through email so who knows if they will even read it or reply. Will never fly AA again if I can help it."
silvia of Miami Beach, FL," Oct. 14, 2016","I was on an almost 2 hour flight (Flight AA3936) stuck sitting with one leg over my bag and the other on the edge of the aisle. Not once was I asked to check in my bag nor told it wouldn't fit on the overhead bin. By the time we landed my knees, hips and back were killing me and I had to have help from the gentleman next to me to be able to stand up. So glad there wasn't an emergency 'cause this would have been one hell of a hazard. Lesson learned not to use this airline again."
sorin of Framingham, MA," Oct. 13, 2016","American Airlines‰Û_the new standard for horrible service. Oh‰Û_I mean HORRIBLE! I travel very frequently for work and have stuck to one specific airline in order to build my status with them (ie. first class upgrades often, better seat choices, free checked bags). Recently, service has taken a turn for the worse. I‰Ûªm a reasonable guy and tolerate more than most. Call it my Southern hospitality, my upbringing or my service to the community when I served in law enforcement, but I just plain put up with more‰Û_until now."
Denise of Springfield, VA," Oct. 12, 2016","I travel 80%~ for Work and have flown with almost every airline multiple times. AA is by far the worst. Not due to their customer service/staff/delays or anything like that (at least that I‰Ûªve noticed), but their planes have no entertainment system on each seat, they do not play movies on the overhead screens, and they don‰Ûªt even have a free WiFi movie/tv option you can connect to using your phone! I‰Ûªm currently on a flight from Boston to Phoenix and was utterly shocked when I sat in my seat and noticed no form of entertainment for a cross-country flight. Delta and other airlines provide personal entertainment screens on each screen or a smartphone connect feature for 2+ hr flights, which in turn make the flights more enjoyable. Anyways, to avoid rambling on and on about the lack of technology on AA planes I‰Ûªll just say if you enjoyed traveling in the late 90s early 2000s, then AA is for you. If you want to travel in 2017 and beyond, find a different airline."
RITA of Budapest, Other," Oct. 12, 2016","I had a horrible experience today on my flight back to Miami. I have been an AAdvantage member for many years now and have always chosen to be loyal to American but after today's experience that may change. The onboarding process was fine and the flight was on time, which to be honest is rare but I was happy. When the snacks and beverage cart came the attendant did not smile, looked unhappy to take our beverage order, handed me and my husband 2 cookies, I then I told her, ""Can we just get pretzels?"" She said ""Then I need the cookies back."" I was honestly appalled."
Bryan of Glen Oaks, NY," Oct. 10, 2016","Don't deserve single star. Also, I have a flight from Chicago to Minneapolis 5 hours from now. And they have seats available on the earlier flight but won't give you without charging $75. They are ok to make you wait or fly a flight with empty seats but no customer delight which is no cost to them. No customer driven company and not looking for going extra mile to make customer happy. Never travel on American Airlines again."
Linda of South Lake Tahoe, CA," Oct. 7, 2016","Worst experience ever with AA never again, they treated my dad like garbage, they humiliated my dad in front of my niece travelling with him and in front of all passengers, just because my dad is ** and not fluent in English. I wish I could sue them for discrimination against my dad for not speaking English fluent instead of offering assistance in Spanish which, the sky harbor airport in Arizona has plenty of bilingual employees. DO NOT FLY AA EVER, pay more with a different airline. The only reason why my dad and niece flew AA to go to my brother's funeral, thank you AA for the worst day ever. It's a shame I have to put a star instead of no stars service."
Amber of Derry, NH," Oct. 6, 2016","This American Airlines review is out of frustration due to a lot of things. They're a disgrace! The employees are rude, there is no leg room, no entertainment, and treat people like herds of sheep. They have a ""New"" rule where they charge $50 at the gate to carry on your luggage. Are you kidding me? $50 for a carry on? And I can't even use the overhead bin! Disgraceful! Basically these guys are crooks! They're a disgrace. Last time I flew with American their flight was delayed by 2 hours and we ended up missing our connecting flight because it was the last flight out. We ended up having to stay an extra day and had to pay $100 for a hotel. We missed my sisters wedding. On the way back we ended up stuck on the tarmac for 2 hours. Of course!"
lisa of Honolulu, HI," Oct. 6, 2016","I booked a ticket back when the hurricane were hitting down south every other week. Because of that I was not able to attend my trip in GA. They told me I had up to a year to use my ticket. So when I try to rebook my ticket they are now close to $500. Mind you this is the highest rate out of all the airlines for my particular dates, I asked for a refund because I didn't wanna double what I paid the first time and I was told by the Supervisor (Willie ** in Dallas ) that my only option was to ""use it or lost it"". Being a supervisor myself I thought the tone in which he said it was very careless and he didn't try to help the situation at all. I would never talk to my customers the way he spoke to me especially after losing out on $300!!"
Bernards of Cortland, NY," Oct. 6, 2016","I just completed a flight on American Airlines. I had read negative reviews, but I found the American Airlines people I had contact with were great, tried to provide all the service they could because our flight had been cancelled due WX and had to layover at ORD. My complaint is the phoney coupon given for a hotel room for a ""discounted rate"". The coupon has nothing to do with American Airlines, but is only a hotel booking service. When I called the phone number provided I was told the only available room was 10 miles away and given a rate of $80.00. It was getting late in the evening so took it. Then was advised there was a $15 service charge to book the room. American Airline paid none of this. The shuttle bus to the hotel was packed (Other delayed passengers). When I got home I checked the hotel rate and found the same room went for $105. I ""saved"" $10. The hotel was a Holiday Inn Express. Room not bad."
Suma of Mckinney, TX," Oct. 6, 2016","I was en route from San Antonio Texas to Hong Kong and when checking in for the domestic portion of the flight at the ticket counter, the woman claimed there was a problem with my passport. I asked for details and she claimed ""There are spots on your passport."" I told her the passport was still valid and did not expire until the following year."" She made up some baloney about Homeland Security not letting people fly with spots on their passport. I told her I checked their website and there was no mention of anything like that. She then claimed, ""Oh, they don't tell you."" I said, ""Then how are you supposed to know?"" She then sarcastically claimed I needed glasses, so I put my glasses on and told her those so called spots are not a problem. "

While I was away, I heard the news that my dad had passed away. In which, I contacted American Airlines right away and asked if anything can be done. I wanted to fly back before my actual trip date, due to obvious reasons. I even offered to provide them with a death certificate if need be (although, I don't think that is even something they should ask for right away). I spoke to 3 different customer service reps who were all horrible to speak with. They had zero compassion and empathy and just dismissed me as if what I was experiencing was far from a big deal to them. "
Bert of New York, NY," Sept. 30, 2016","I was on the plane for 14 hours due to a delay. Sitting in a broken seat that would not recline. I told the stewardess and she could care less, said nothing she can do. After I got home I contacted the airline and they issued me a fourteen dollar credit. I had paid 197.34 dollars for preferred seats. The worst flight of my life, never again w/ this airline."
Maureen of Delray Beach, FL," Sept. 28, 2016","Overall, (Un)American Airlines continues to disappoint. I really only ever fly with AA as a last resort, and I can't see any reason to recommend traveling with AA. I was prior active duty Army, and now I'm a reservist, and only American Airlines makes me feel like my service is less important now. United, Southwest, Jet Blue, Delta, every other airline doesn't discriminate between Active Duty and Reserve/Guardsmen when it comes to bag fees. So, along with uncomfortable, outdated planes and poor service, I spent a $100 checking bags to and from my destination."
Kevin of Defuniak Springs, FL," Sept. 27, 2016",American Airlines is the worst airlines to fly anywhere. They cram you in the seats with no leg room or any room for that matter. I requested a wheelchair at airport and waited 30 minutes upon someone finally arriving. They took me the wrong way to my next check in and I missed my flight. They said I would have to rebook my ticket and just wait for the next flight. Attendant at the gate was very disrespectful and not helpful at all. I had no control over this situation at all. Not to mention when I did finally arrive at my destination that I requested a wheelchair prior to my departure.
mirissa of Long Beach, CA," Sept. 27, 2016","American Airlines is the worst airline in THE WORLD, and should change their name, it is utterly disgraceful that as an American they use this name. Their policy is to not apologize for anything, to be as rude as possible to people who are basically held hostage to them and their BS policies like closing the door to the gate while people are standing there then charging them money to rebook their flight, not caring at all about the bags on their way to a destination without the owners there to pick them up. Then being told when lodging a complaint that it was going in one ear and out the other. I have never been treated so poorly in my life, I will never again fly with this airline, I hope they go bankrupt and get the worst karma life can give.

When the snacks and beverage cart came the attendant did not smile, looked unhappy to take our beverage order, handed me and my husband 2 cookies, I then I told her, ""Can we just get pretzels?"" She said ""Then I need the cookies back."" I was honestly appalled."
larry of Newark, NJ," Sept. 5, 2016","Don't deserve single star. Also, I have a flight from Chicago to Minneapolis 5 hours from now. And they have seats available on the earlier flight but won't give you without charging $75. They are ok to make you wait or fly a flight with empty seats but no customer delight which is no cost to them. No customer driven company and not looking for going extra mile to make customer happy. Never travel on American Airlines again."
Greg of Enumclaw, WA," Sept. 5, 2016","Worst experience ever with AA never again, they treated my dad like garbage, they humiliated my dad in front of my niece travelling with him and in front of all passengers, just because my dad is ** and not fluent in English. I wish I could sue them for discrimination against my dad for not speaking English fluent instead of offering assistance in Spanish which, the sky harbor airport in Arizona has plenty of bilingual employees. DO NOT FLY AA EVER, pay more with a different airline. The only reason why my dad and niece flew AA to go to my brother's funeral, thank you AA for the worst day ever. It's a shame I have to put a star instead of no stars service."
Matthew of Westerville, OH," Sept. 4, 2016","This American Airlines review is out of frustration due to a lot of things. They're a disgrace! The employees are rude, there is no leg room, no entertainment, and treat people like herds of sheep. They have a ""New"" rule where they charge $50 at the gate to carry on your luggage. Are you kidding me? $50 for a carry on? And I can't even use the overhead bin! Disgraceful! Basically these guys are crooks! They're a disgrace. Last time I flew with American their flight was delayed by 2 hours and we ended up missing our connecting flight because it was the last flight out. We ended up having to stay an extra day and had to pay $100 for a hotel. We missed my sisters wedding. On the way back we ended up stuck on the tarmac for 2 hours. Of course!"
s. of Gaithersburg, MD," Sept. 1, 2016","I booked a ticket back when the hurricane were hitting down south every other week. Because of that I was not able to attend my trip in GA. They told me I had up to a year to use my ticket. So when I try to rebook my ticket they are now close to $500. Mind you this is the highest rate out of all the airlines for my particular dates, I asked for a refund because I didn't wanna double what I paid the first time and I was told by the Supervisor (Willie ** in Dallas ) that my only option was to ""use it or lost it"". Being a supervisor myself I thought the tone in which he said it was very careless and he didn't try to help the situation at all. I would never talk to my customers the way he spoke to me especially after losing out on $300!!"
Kristin of Southern Pines, NC," Aug. 30, 2016","I just completed a flight on American Airlines. I had read negative reviews, but I found the American Airlines people I had contact with were great, tried to provide all the service they could because our flight had been cancelled due WX and had to layover at ORD. My complaint is the phoney coupon given for a hotel room for a ""discounted rate"". The coupon has nothing to do with American Airlines, but is only a hotel booking service. When I called the phone number provided I was told the only available room was 10 miles away and given a rate of $80.00. It was getting late in the evening so took it. Then was advised there was a $15 service charge to book the room. American Airline paid none of this. The shuttle bus to the hotel was packed (Other delayed passengers). When I got home I checked the hotel rate and found the same room went for $105. I ""saved"" $10. The hotel was a Holiday Inn Express. Room not bad."

I wanted to fly back before my actual trip date, due to obvious reasons. I even offered to provide them with a death certificate if need be (although, I don't think that is even something they should ask for right away).

I had paid 197.34 dollars for preferred seats. The worst flight of my life, never again w/ this airline."
Glenn of Lawton, OK," Aug. 28, 2016","Overall, (Un)American Airlines continues to disappoint. I really only ever fly with AA as a last resort, and I can't see any reason to recommend traveling with AA. I was prior active duty Army, and now I'm a reservist, and only American Airlines makes me feel like my service is less important now. United, Southwest, Jet Blue, Delta, every other airline doesn't discriminate between Active Duty and Reserve/Guardsmen when it comes to bag fees. So, along with uncomfortable, outdated planes and poor service, I spent a $100 checking bags to and from my destination."
sharon of Worksop, Other," Aug. 26, 2016",American Airlines is the worst airlines to fly anywhere. They cram you in the seats with no leg room or any room for that matter. I requested a wheelchair at airport and waited 30 minutes upon someone finally arriving. They took me the wrong way to my next check in and I missed my flight. They said I would have to rebook my ticket and just wait for the next flight. Attendant at the gate was very disrespectful and not helpful at all. I had no control over this situation at all. Not to mention when I did finally arrive at my destination that I requested a wheelchair prior to my departure.
richard of Loughborough, Other," Aug. 26, 2016","American Airlines is the worst airline in THE WORLD, and should change their name, it is utterly disgraceful that as an American they use this name. Their policy is to not apologize for anything, to be as rude as possible to people who are basically held hostage to them and their BS policies like closing the door to the gate while people are standing there then charging them money to rebook their flight, not caring at all about the bags on their way to a destination without the owners there to pick them up. Then being told when lodging a complaint that it was going in one ear and out the other. I have never been treated so poorly in my life, I will never again fly with this airline, I hope they go bankrupt and get the worst karma life can give. Oh yeah and I get to fly with them tomorrow. :/"
John of Coxs Creek, KY," Aug. 25, 2016","Very disappointed. Unlikely I will ever choose American Airlines again. I didn't make my flight in the spring. I was given a voucher to use for future travel. Now I'm being told I can only use it myself, and not for my family. I don't want to use it for myself. What difference does it make? I'm being told different things by different people. The last guy hung up on me and I wasn't even rude to him. This is how AA does business? All I want is to not be penalized for cancelling a flight that was beyond my control. If you have a voucher it should be flexible to use for anyone. AA is the WORST! Hope they go out of business for this nonsense. Airline travel is a joke."
Cui le of Memphis, TN," Aug. 23, 2016","American Airlines canceled my 92-year-old father-in-law's flight to Key West due to Hurricane Irma. On that day American Airline was contacted and the representative said there would be no problem re-booking, just use the reference number. American Airlines even went on TV and said they would waive re-booking fees. Today when calling to re-book the flight and after 57 minutes on the phone, I was told the flight could not be re-booked because it was in their notes I requested a refund. At no time did I request a refund and American Airlines could not locate any record of a refund request. Even so, American Airlines still insisted they could not re-book the flight or issue a refund. If we did not have enough trouble dealing with a Cat 4 hurricane and its devastating aftermath, now American Airlines is adding to the misery. All my father-in-law wants is to come to Key West and see that everyone is alright. Thanks, AA."
Kevin of Albuquerque, NM," Aug. 22, 2016",I bought tickets for my mother in law and son to meet my wife and I in Colorado. We had traveled on different airlines due to connections and therefore were going back on different airlines. My wife and I left on our airplane. My mother in law and son were stranded as the plane had a mechanical. This was 8 AM and the bottom line was it didn't get fixed that day. American gave them a 12.00 voucher good in the terminal and did nothing to get them a room as the rooms they usually used weren't available.
C. of Encino, CA," Aug. 22, 2016","I booked 2 separate flights on American Airlines in Economy since I pay for my air travel. On one they pre-assigned me a back-of-plane middle seat and said that I was required to pay some increased fee for window, aisle or closer to the front. On the second flight they said I have to wait until I reach the boarding gate for any seat. This is ridiculous and unacceptable. The airline has sufficient revenue to - just a suggestion - increase the ""base"" fare to cover a first-come-first-served seat selection and not put everyone into 3rd class or worse status. If they want to surcharge certain premium seats, like middle seats toward the front, that's OK, but this behavior is totally unacceptable and I refuse to fly them (or any airline) that abuses their passengers."
Patricia of Beaumont, CA," Aug. 22, 2016",Well I looked into changing my flight for my fiance and I to go home a day earlier... only to discover that American charges $200.00 a ticket PLUS the difference in price tickets! LIKE THAT IS GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE! So for the price of another ticket I can change my flight! I will be looking elsewhere for flights in the future. I have already paid for a flight and now you are trying to rip me off even more!?! Out of touch and terrible service to a customer of over 5 years. I will be going elsewhere where I don't get bent over the table. Thank you American!
E of North Richland Hills, TX," Aug. 22, 2016","I originally booked my flight to Miami from Washington, DC back in July 2017. I was scheduled to fly September 13-18, 2017. I, like many, had to cancel my trip because of hurricane Irma. I was informed by two customer service representatives that I would be able to rebook my flight to Miami with no additional charges in fare and no change fees. Of course, when it comes time to book my flight, I'm informed about a change fee. I told the agent, I was reassured twice that I would not be charged any additional fees because my initial cancellation was weather related. "
Stephanie of Wellington, CO," Aug. 20, 2016","American Airlines is full of **. Our cruise was cancelled due to Hurricane Irma. It was beyond our control and the airline stated there was nothing that they could do. No partial credit, changes or anything! I will not be flying with them anymore!"
Willie of Nashua, NH," Aug. 19, 2016",My husband and I were scheduled to fly out at 7:15 am to go to California for a very important family matter. We do not live near the airport so we were up early to make sure we were early and nothing could go wrong. But things did go wrong. When we got to the airport we went and printed out tickets at the self checkout. We did notice that it mentioned no overhead storage for our carry on bags. So confused because we fly a lot and there is always overhead storage or they place in under the cabin. So we asked a lady that was standing in the area of self print and she looked and our tickets said we would be fine... Again we were told wrong.
Ronald of San Jose, CA," Aug. 18, 2016","On September 4 my family of 5 arrived at the airport in Anchorage to fly home to Toronto via Dallas. Four of us had carry-on sized luggage but one had a mid-sized suitcase that we knew we would have to check. Our flight to Toronto included a 12.5-hour connection at DFW (not by choice). Since none of us sleep well on planes, we were considering going to a hotel following the overnight flight to DFW. When checking the suitcase, I specifically asked the American Airlines agent ""if we only check this bag to DFW and then go to a hotel for a few hours of sleep, will we be charged a second baggage fee to check the bag in for the flight to Toronto? If so we can rearrange the bags so that we can just check it through to Toronto."" "
Dave of Long Beach, CA," Aug. 17, 2016","I purchased the basic economy ticket.

In the future, I will do all I can to avoid flying with your airline and don't count on a positive recommendation from me to others! Also, stop charging for the first piece of checked in luggage!"

I called at night again because I was worried I saw it was still cancel. After almost 2 hours they answered the phone. I told them what happened. They told me that they were very sorry but the flight was canceled and they didnt' have flight for Sept 12. They gave me 1 stop flight for Sept 13. "
Jamie of Naples, FL," Aug. 17, 2016","I was scheduled to fly out of Tampa International on Sunday, September, 17th to Durango, CO. I live in Sarasota, and just returned home the other day after evacuating for Hurricane Irma. I fled Florida and headed to Georgia, where I had to rent a hotel for a few nights. When I returned home I was fortunate enough not to have suffered damage. I of course have yard debris strewn about and I am still without power. The power company has estimated by the end of the day on September 22nd I will have power. With the extra costs incurred from having to leave my home, and the loss of power, I decided this was not a good time to travel."
keith of Heber City, UT," Aug. 15, 2016","Hurricane Irma was mess for AA. I get it. I'm sure there were thousands who were stuck trying to get their flights changed. Unfortunately, I was in Costa Rica with a connection via Miami and I got, as the AA agent said ""the short end of the stick."" I would be stuck almost another week in Costa Rica as everything AA had was booked out or cancelled. I saw a little bit of silver lining when I found that if I could get to Mexico city, I could fly home via DFW. However, AA would not change the ticket as it is against their rules to change the country of origin on a ticket. ""We cannot do it."" However, a more accurate description is ""will not."""
jean of Northport, Other," Aug. 14, 2016","We were delayed on our AA out of Seattle due to having to wait on flight crew. Managed to make it to Dallas on time BUT had to sit on the tarmac for 20 mins waiting for a gait in order to deplane. This caused to miss our connecting flight. Next available flight is the next day. Asked about compensation for overnight hotel stay (there are 7 in our party, including a 3 year old) and were denied due to the delay being coded as weather related, which is absolutely bogus. So livid, frustrated, and tired at this point. Also found out AA has no number to call for complaints... You have to go through email so who knows if they will even read it or reply. Will never fly AA again if I can help it."
A of San Antonio, TX," Aug. 14, 2016","I was on an almost 2 hour flight (Flight AA3936) stuck sitting with one leg over my bag and the other on the edge of the aisle. Not once was I asked to check in my bag nor told it wouldn't fit on the overhead bin. By the time we landed my knees, hips and back were killing me and I had to have help from the gentleman next to me to be able to stand up. So glad there wasn't an emergency 'cause this would have been one hell of a hazard. Lesson learned not to use this airline again."
J of Rocky Hill, CT," Aug. 14, 2016","American Airlines‰Û_the new standard for horrible service. Oh‰Û_I mean HORRIBLE! I travel very frequently for work and have stuck to one specific airline in order to build my status with them (ie. first class upgrades often, better seat choices, free checked bags). Recently, service has taken a turn for the worse. I‰Ûªm a reasonable guy and tolerate more than most. Call it my Southern hospitality, my upbringing or my service to the community when I served in law enforcement, but I just plain put up with more‰Û_until now."
Lakshminarayana of Irving, TX," Aug. 13, 2016","I travel 80%~ for Work and have flown with almost every airline multiple times. AA is by far the worst. Not due to their customer service/staff/delays or anything like that (at least that I‰Ûªve noticed), but their planes have no entertainment system on each seat, they do not play movies on the overhead screens, and they don‰Ûªt even have a free WiFi movie/tv option you can connect to using your phone! I‰Ûªm currently on a flight from Boston to Phoenix and was utterly shocked when I sat in my seat and noticed no form of entertainment for a cross-country flight. Delta and other airlines provide personal entertainment screens on each screen or a smartphone connect feature for 2+ hr flights, which in turn make the flights more enjoyable. Anyways, to avoid rambling on and on about the lack of technology on AA planes I‰Ûªll just say if you enjoyed traveling in the late 90s early 2000s, then AA is for you. If you want to travel in 2017 and beyond, find a different airline."

I will be going elsewhere where I don't get bent over the table. Thank you American!
Janet of Lago Vista, TX," Aug. 1, 2016","I originally booked my flight to Miami from Washington, DC back in July 2017. I was scheduled to fly September 13-18, 2017. I, like many, had to cancel my trip because of hurricane Irma. I was informed by two customer service representatives that I would be able to rebook my flight to Miami with no additional charges in fare and no change fees. Of course, when it comes time to book my flight, I'm informed about a change fee. I told the agent, I was reassured twice that I would not be charged any additional fees because my initial cancellation was weather related. "
donna of Leesburg, VA," July 31, 2016","American Airlines is full of **. Our cruise was cancelled due to Hurricane Irma. It was beyond our control and the airline stated there was nothing that they could do. No partial credit, changes or anything! I will not be flying with them anymore!"
Guss of Clovis, CA," July 30, 2016",My husband and I were scheduled to fly out at 7:15 am to go to California for a very important family matter. We do not live near the airport so we were up early to make sure we were early and nothing could go wrong. But things did go wrong. When we got to the airport we went and printed out tickets at the self checkout. We did notice that it mentioned no overhead storage for our carry on bags. So confused because we fly a lot and there is always overhead storage or they place in under the cabin. So we asked a lady that was standing in the area of self print and she looked and our tickets said we would be fine... Again we were told wrong.
STEVEN of Wallingford, CT," July 29, 2016","On September 4 my family of 5 arrived at the airport in Anchorage to fly home to Toronto via Dallas. Four of us had carry-on sized luggage but one had a mid-sized suitcase that we knew we would have to check. Our flight to Toronto included a 12.5-hour connection at DFW (not by choice). Since none of us sleep well on planes, we were considering going to a hotel following the overnight flight to DFW. When checking the suitcase, I specifically asked the American Airlines agent ""if we only check this bag to DFW and then go to a hotel for a few hours of sleep, will we be charged a second baggage fee to check the bag in for the flight to Toronto? If so we can rearrange the bags so that we can just check it through to Toronto."" "
Rogerio of Massillon, OH," July 29, 2016","I purchased the basic economy ticket. When I was getting ready to board in Charlotte, the attendant mentioned that this was a new program for your airline and that customers have stated it was cost effective. However, this was not my case! I paid nearly $600 to fly from Columbus, OH to Asheville, NC. Absolutely absurd!!! In the future, I will do all I can to avoid flying with your airline and don't count on a positive recommendation from me to others! Also, stop charging for the first piece of checked in luggage!"

September 11 I checked the flight online and it was canceled. I called customer service. Patricia told me that I was wrong it wasn't cancel. I called at night again because I was worried I saw it was still cancel. After almost 2 hours they answered the phone. I told them what happened. They told me that they were very sorry but the flight was canceled and they didnt' have flight for Sept 12. They gave me 1 stop flight for Sept 13. "
Vickie of Mint Hill, NC," July 28, 2016","I was scheduled to fly out of Tampa International on Sunday, September, 17th to Durango, CO. I live in Sarasota, and just returned home the other day after evacuating for Hurricane Irma. I fled Florida and headed to Georgia, where I had to rent a hotel for a few nights. When I returned home I was fortunate enough not to have suffered damage. I of course have yard debris strewn about and I am still without power. The power company has estimated by the end of the day on September 22nd I will have power. With the extra costs incurred from having to leave my home, and the loss of power, I decided this was not a good time to travel."
Michael of Savannah, GA," July 27, 2016","Hurricane Irma was mess for AA. I get it. I'm sure there were thousands who were stuck trying to get their flights changed. Unfortunately, I was in Costa Rica with a connection via Miami and I got, as the AA agent said ""the short end of the stick."" I would be stuck almost another week in Costa Rica as everything AA had was booked out or cancelled. I saw a little bit of silver lining when I found that if I could get to Mexico city, I could fly home via DFW. However, AA would not change the ticket as it is against their rules to change the country of origin on a ticket. ""We cannot do it."" However, a more accurate description is ""will not."""
Mitu of Haslet, TX," July 26, 2016","We were delayed on our AA out of Seattle due to having to wait on flight crew. Managed to make it to Dallas on time BUT had to sit on the tarmac for 20 mins waiting for a gait in order to deplane. This caused to miss our connecting flight. Next available flight is the next day. Asked about compensation for overnight hotel stay (there are 7 in our party, including a 3 year old) and were denied due to the delay being coded as weather related, which is absolutely bogus. So livid, frustrated, and tired at this point. Also found out AA has no number to call for complaints... You have to go through email so who knows if they will even read it or reply. Will never fly AA again if I can help it."
Michelle of Mesa, AZ," July 26, 2016","I was on an almost 2 hour flight (Flight AA3936) stuck sitting with one leg over my bag and the other on the edge of the aisle. Not once was I asked to check in my bag nor told it wouldn't fit on the overhead bin. By the time we landed my knees, hips and back were killing me and I had to have help from the gentleman next to me to be able to stand up. So glad there wasn't an emergency 'cause this would have been one hell of a hazard. Lesson learned not to use this airline again."
T of Philadelphia, PA," July 25, 2016","American Airlines‰Û_the new standard for horrible service. Oh‰Û_I mean HORRIBLE! I travel very frequently for work and have stuck to one specific airline in order to build my status with them (ie. first class upgrades often, better seat choices, free checked bags). Recently, service has taken a turn for the worse. I‰Ûªm a reasonable guy and tolerate more than most. Call it my Southern hospitality, my upbringing or my service to the community when I served in law enforcement, but I just plain put up with more‰Û_until now."
Manjari of Clayton, MO," July 24, 2016","I travel 80%~ for Work and have flown with almost every airline multiple times. AA is by far the worst. Not due to their customer service/staff/delays or anything like that (at least that I‰Ûªve noticed), but their planes have no entertainment system on each seat, they do not play movies on the overhead screens, and they don‰Ûªt even have a free WiFi movie/tv option you can connect to using your phone! I‰Ûªm currently on a flight from Boston to Phoenix and was utterly shocked when I sat in my seat and noticed no form of entertainment for a cross-country flight. Delta and other airlines provide personal entertainment screens on each screen or a smartphone connect feature for 2+ hr flights, which in turn make the flights more enjoyable. Anyways, to avoid rambling on and on about the lack of technology on AA planes I‰Ûªll just say if you enjoyed traveling in the late 90s early 2000s, then AA is for you. If you want to travel in 2017 and beyond, find a different airline."
Suresh of Dallas, TX," July 23, 2016","I had a horrible experience today on my flight back to Miami. I have been an AAdvantage member for many years now and have always chosen to be loyal to American but after today's experience that may change. The onboarding process was fine and the flight was on time, which to be honest is rare but I was happy. When the snacks and beverage cart came the attendant did not smile, looked unhappy to take our beverage order, handed me and my husband 2 cookies, I then I told her, ""Can we just get pretzels?"" She said ""Then I need the cookies back."" I was honestly appalled."
Selin of Sunnyside, NY," July 22, 2016","Don't deserve single star. Also, I have a flight from Chicago to Minneapolis 5 hours from now. And they have seats available on the earlier flight but won't give you without charging $75. They are ok to make you wait or fly a flight with empty seats but no customer delight which is no cost to them. No customer driven company and not looking for going extra mile to make customer happy. Never travel on American Airlines again."
j of Annandale, VA," July 20, 2016","Worst experience ever with AA never again, they treated my dad like garbage, they humiliated my dad in front of my niece travelling with him and in front of all passengers, just because my dad is ** and not fluent in English. I wish I could sue them for discrimination against my dad for not speaking English fluent instead of offering assistance in Spanish which, the sky harbor airport in Arizona has plenty of bilingual employees. DO NOT FLY AA EVER, pay more with a different airline. The only reason why my dad and niece flew AA to go to my brother's funeral, thank you AA for the worst day ever. It's a shame I have to put a star instead of no stars service."
Craig of Nassau, NY," July 20, 2016","This American Airlines review is out of frustration due to a lot of things. They're a disgrace! The employees are rude, there is no leg room, no entertainment, and treat people like herds of sheep. They have a ""New"" rule where they charge $50 at the gate to carry on your luggage. Are you kidding me? $50 for a carry on? And I can't even use the overhead bin! Disgraceful! Basically these guys are crooks! They're a disgrace. Last time I flew with American their flight was delayed by 2 hours and we ended up missing our connecting flight because it was the last flight out. We ended up having to stay an extra day and had to pay $100 for a hotel. We missed my sisters wedding. On the way back we ended up stuck on the tarmac for 2 hours. Of course!"
dan of New York, NY," July 19, 2016","I booked a ticket back when the hurricane were hitting down south every other week. Because of that I was not able to attend my trip in GA. They told me I had up to a year to use my ticket. So when I try to rebook my ticket they are now close to $500. Mind you this is the highest rate out of all the airlines for my particular dates, I asked for a refund because I didn't wanna double what I paid the first time and I was told by the Supervisor (Willie ** in Dallas ) that my only option was to ""use it or lost it"". Being a supervisor myself I thought the tone in which he said it was very careless and he didn't try to help the situation at all. I would never talk to my customers the way he spoke to me especially after losing out on $300!!"
Adam of Portland, OR," July 19, 2016","I just completed a flight on American Airlines. I had read negative reviews, but I found the American Airlines people I had contact with were great, tried to provide all the service they could because our flight had been cancelled due WX and had to layover at ORD. My complaint is the phoney coupon given for a hotel room for a ""discounted rate"". The coupon has nothing to do with American Airlines, but is only a hotel booking service. When I called the phone number provided I was told the only available room was 10 miles away and given a rate of $80.00. It was getting late in the evening so took it. Then was advised there was a $15 service charge to book the room. American Airline paid none of this. The shuttle bus to the hotel was packed (Other delayed passengers). When I got home I checked the hotel rate and found the same room went for $105. I ""saved"" $10. The hotel was a Holiday Inn Express. Room not bad."
JLynne of Albuquerque, NM," July 18, 2016","I was en route from San Antonio Texas to Hong Kong and when checking in for the domestic portion of the flight at the ticket counter, the woman claimed there was a problem with my passport. I asked for details and she claimed ""There are spots on your passport."" I told her the passport was still valid and did not expire until the following year."" She made up some baloney about Homeland Security not letting people fly with spots on their passport. I told her I checked their website and there was no mention of anything like that. She then claimed, ""Oh, they don't tell you."" I said, ""Then how are you supposed to know?"" She then sarcastically claimed I needed glasses, so I put my glasses on and told her those so called spots are not a problem. "

Toy of Southfield, MI," July 18, 2016","Where do I even begin? I had a round trip flight booked from Toronto, Ontario to Busan, South Korea back in the month of July (2017). While I was away, I heard the news that my dad had passed away. In which, I contacted American Airlines right away and asked if anything can be done. I wanted to fly back before my actual trip date, due to obvious reasons. I even offered to provide them with a death certificate if need be (although, I don't think that is even something they should ask for right away). I spoke to 3 different customer service reps who were all horrible to speak with. They had zero compassion and empathy and just dismissed me as if what I was experiencing was far from a big deal to them. "
Tami of Brooklyn, NY," July 17, 2016","I was on the plane for 14 hours due to a delay. Sitting in a broken seat that would not recline. I told the stewardess and she could care less, said nothing she can do. After I got home I contacted the airline and they issued me a fourteen dollar credit. I had paid 197.34 dollars for preferred seats. The worst flight of my life, never again w/ this airline."
Rick of Erie, PA," July 16, 2016","Overall, (Un)American Airlines continues to disappoint. I really only ever fly with AA as a last resort, and I can't see any reason to recommend traveling with AA. I was prior active duty Army, and now I'm a reservist, and only American Airlines makes me feel like my service is less important now. United, Southwest, Jet Blue, Delta, every other airline doesn't discriminate between Active Duty and Reserve/Guardsmen when it comes to bag fees. So, along with uncomfortable, outdated planes and poor service, I spent a $100 checking bags to and from my destination."
dianne maurice of Turin, Other," July 15, 2016",American Airlines is the worst airlines to fly anywhere. They cram you in the seats with no leg room or any room for that matter. I requested a wheelchair at airport and waited 30 minutes upon someone finally arriving. They took me the wrong way to my next check in and I missed my flight. They said I would have to rebook my ticket and just wait for the next flight. Attendant at the gate was very disrespectful and not helpful at all. I had no control over this situation at all. Not to mention when I did finally arrive at my destination that I requested a wheelchair prior to my departure.
Aziel of Honolulu, HI," July 14, 2016","American Airlines is the worst airline in THE WORLD, and should change their name, it is utterly disgraceful that as an American they use this name. Their policy is to not apologize for anything, to be as rude as possible to people who are basically held hostage to them and their BS policies like closing the door to the gate while people are standing there then charging them money to rebook their flight, not caring at all about the bags on their way to a destination without the owners there to pick them up. Then being told when lodging a complaint that it was going in one ear and out the other. I have never been treated so poorly in my life, I will never again fly with this airline, I hope they go bankrupt and get the worst karma life can give. Oh yeah and I get to fly with them tomorrow. :/"
Claudia of Las Vegas, NV," July 14, 2016","Very disappointed. Unlikely I will ever choose American Airlines again. I didn't make my flight in the spring. I was given a voucher to use for future travel. Now I'm being told I can only use it myself, and not for my family. I don't want to use it for myself. What difference does it make? I'm being told different things by different people. The last guy hung up on me and I wasn't even rude to him. This is how AA does business? All I want is to not be penalized for cancelling a flight that was beyond my control. If you have a voucher it should be flexible to use for anyone. AA is the WORST! Hope they go out of business for this nonsense. Airline travel is a joke."
Marc of Sacramento, CA," July 14, 2016","American Airlines canceled my 92-year-old father-in-law's flight to Key West due to Hurricane Irma. On that day American Airline was contacted and the representative said there would be no problem re-booking, just use the reference number. American Airlines even went on TV and said they would waive re-booking fees. Today when calling to re-book the flight and after 57 minutes on the phone, I was told the flight could not be re-booked because it was in their notes I requested a refund. At no time did I request a refund and American Airlines could not locate any record of a refund request. Even so, American Airlines still insisted they could not re-book the flight or issue a refund. If we did not have enough trouble dealing with a Cat 4 hurricane and its devastating aftermath, now American Airlines is adding to the misery. All my father-in-law wants is to come to Key West and see that everyone is alright. Thanks, AA."
Debra of Brandon, MS," July 14, 2016",I bought tickets for my mother in law and son to meet my wife and I in Colorado. We had traveled on different airlines due to connections and therefore were going back on different airlines. My wife and I left on our airplane. My mother in law and son were stranded as the plane had a mechanical. This was 8 AM and the bottom line was it didn't get fixed that day. American gave them a 12.00 voucher good in the terminal and did nothing to get them a room as the rooms they usually used weren't available.
martin of Oxford, CT," July 11, 2016","I booked 2 separate flights on American Airlines in Economy since I pay for my air travel. On one they pre-assigned me a back-of-plane middle seat and said that I was required to pay some increased fee for window, aisle or closer to the front. On the second flight they said I have to wait until I reach the boarding gate for any seat. This is ridiculous and unacceptable. The airline has sufficient revenue to - just a suggestion - increase the ""base"" fare to cover a first-come-first-served seat selection and not put everyone into 3rd class or worse status. If they want to surcharge certain premium seats, like middle seats toward the front, that's OK, but this behavior is totally unacceptable and I refuse to fly them (or any airline) that abuses their passengers."
Jeanne of Aiken, SC," July 11, 2016",Well I looked into changing my flight for my fiance and I to go home a day earlier... only to discover that American charges $200.00 a ticket PLUS the difference in price tickets!

Then was advised there was a $15 service charge to book the room. American Airline paid none of this. The shuttle bus to the hotel was packed (Other delayed passengers). When I got home I checked the hotel rate and found the same room went for $105. I ""saved"" $10. The hotel was a Holiday Inn Express. Room not bad."
Katherine of Newport Beach, CA," June 26, 2016","I was en route from San Antonio Texas to Hong Kong and when checking in for the domestic portion of the flight at the ticket counter, the woman claimed there was a problem with my passport. I asked for details and she claimed ""There are spots on your passport."" I told her the passport was still valid and did not expire until the following year."" She made up some baloney about Homeland Security not letting people fly with spots on their passport. I told her I checked their website and there was no mention of anything like that. She then claimed, ""Oh, they don't tell you."" I said, ""Then how are you supposed to know?"" She then sarcastically claimed I needed glasses, so I put my glasses on and told her those so called spots are not a problem. "

While I was away, I heard the news that my dad had passed away. In which, I contacted American Airlines right away and asked if anything can be done. I wanted to fly back before my actual trip date, due to obvious reasons. I even offered to provide them with a death certificate if need be (although, I don't think that is even something they should ask for right away). I spoke to 3 different customer service reps who were all horrible to speak with. They had zero compassion and empathy and just dismissed me as if what I was experiencing was far from a big deal to them. "
Antony of Columbus, OH," June 26, 2016","I was on the plane for 14 hours due to a delay. Sitting in a broken seat that would not recline. I told the stewardess and she could care less, said nothing she can do. After I got home I contacted the airline and they issued me a fourteen dollar credit. I had paid 197.34 dollars for preferred seats. The worst flight of my life, never again w/ this airline."
Ramin of Irvine, CA," June 25, 2016","Overall, (Un)American Airlines continues to disappoint. I really only ever fly with AA as a last resort, and I can't see any reason to recommend traveling with AA. I was prior active duty Army, and now I'm a reservist, and only American Airlines makes me feel like my service is less important now. United, Southwest, Jet Blue, Delta, every other airline doesn't discriminate between Active Duty and Reserve/Guardsmen when it comes to bag fees. So, along with uncomfortable, outdated planes and poor service, I spent a $100 checking bags to and from my destination."
murray of Carlstadt, NJ," June 23, 2016",American Airlines is the worst airlines to fly anywhere. They cram you in the seats with no leg room or any room for that matter. I requested a wheelchair at airport and waited 30 minutes upon someone finally arriving. They took me the wrong way to my next check in and I missed my flight. They said I would have to rebook my ticket and just wait for the next flight. Attendant at the gate was very disrespectful and not helpful at all. I had no control over this situation at all. Not to mention when I did finally arrive at my destination that I requested a wheelchair prior to my departure.
ruby of Bakersfield, CA," June 22, 2016","American Airlines is the worst airline in THE WORLD, and should change their name, it is utterly disgraceful that as an American they use this name. Their policy is to not apologize for anything, to be as rude as possible to people who are basically held hostage to them and their BS policies like closing the door to the gate while people are standing there then charging them money to rebook their flight, not caring at all about the bags on their way to a destination without the owners there to pick them up. Then being told when lodging a complaint that it was going in one ear and out the other. I have never been treated so poorly in my life, I will never again fly with this airline, I hope they go bankrupt and get the worst karma life can give. Oh yeah and I get to fly with them tomorrow. :/"
L. S. of Vancouver, WA," June 21, 2016","Very disappointed. Unlikely I will ever choose American Airlines again. I didn't make my flight in the spring. I was given a voucher to use for future travel. Now I'm being told I can only use it myself, and not for my family. I don't want to use it for myself. What difference does it make? I'm being told different things by different people. The last guy hung up on me and I wasn't even rude to him. This is how AA does business? All I want is to not be penalized for cancelling a flight that was beyond my control. If you have a voucher it should be flexible to use for anyone. AA is the WORST! Hope they go out of business for this nonsense. Airline travel is a joke."
Ibn of Long Island City, NY," June 21, 2016","American Airlines canceled my 92-year-old father-in-law's flight to Key West due to Hurricane Irma. On that day American Airline was contacted and the representative said there would be no problem re-booking, just use the reference number. American Airlines even went on TV and said they would waive re-booking fees. Today when calling to re-book the flight and after 57 minutes on the phone, I was told the flight could not be re-booked because it was in their notes I requested a refund. At no time did I request a refund and American Airlines could not locate any record of a refund request. Even so, American Airlines still insisted they could not re-book the flight or issue a refund. If we did not have enough trouble dealing with a Cat 4 hurricane and its devastating aftermath, now American Airlines is adding to the misery. All my father-in-law wants is to come to Key West and see that everyone is alright. Thanks, AA."
Fang Hsing of Providence, RI," June 20, 2016",I bought tickets for my mother in law and son to meet my wife and I in Colorado. We had traveled on different airlines due to connections and therefore were going back on different airlines. My wife and I left on our airplane. My mother in law and son were stranded as the plane had a mechanical. This was 8 AM and the bottom line was it didn't get fixed that day. American gave them a 12.00 voucher good in the terminal and did nothing to get them a room as the rooms they usually used weren't available.
elizabeth of Middletown, CT," June 20, 2016","I booked 2 separate flights on American Airlines in Economy since I pay for my air travel. On one they pre-assigned me a back-of-plane middle seat and said that I was required to pay some increased fee for window, aisle or closer to the front. On the second flight they said I have to wait until I reach the boarding gate for any seat. This is ridiculous and unacceptable. The airline has sufficient revenue to - just a suggestion - increase the ""base"" fare to cover a first-come-first-served seat selection and not put everyone into 3rd class or worse status. If they want to surcharge certain premium seats, like middle seats toward the front, that's OK, but this behavior is totally unacceptable and I refuse to fly them (or any airline) that abuses their passengers."
Kristie of Oxford, AL," June 20, 2016",Well I looked into changing my flight for my fiance and I to go home a day earlier... only to discover that American charges $200.00 a ticket PLUS the difference in price tickets! LIKE THAT IS GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE! So for the price of another ticket I can change my flight! I will be looking elsewhere for flights in the future. I have already paid for a flight and now you are trying to rip me off even more!?! Out of touch and terrible service to a customer of over 5 years. I will be going elsewhere where I don't get bent over the table. Thank you American!

I was informed by two customer service representatives that I would be able to rebook my flight to Miami with no additional charges in fare and no change fees. Of course, when it comes time to book my flight, I'm informed about a change fee.

Susan of Scarsdale, NY," June 17, 2016",My husband and I were scheduled to fly out at 7:15 am to go to California for a very important family matter. We do not live near the airport so we were up early to make sure we were early and nothing could go wrong. But things did go wrong. When we got to the airport we went and printed out tickets at the self checkout. We did notice that it mentioned no overhead storage for our carry on bags. So confused because we fly a lot and there is always overhead storage or they place in under the cabin. So we asked a lady that was standing in the area of self print and she looked and our tickets said we would be fine... Again we were told wrong.
Kevin of Ofallon, IL," June 16, 2016","On September 4 my family of 5 arrived at the airport in Anchorage to fly home to Toronto via Dallas. Four of us had carry-on sized luggage but one had a mid-sized suitcase that we knew we would have to check. Our flight to Toronto included a 12.5-hour connection at DFW (not by choice). Since none of us sleep well on planes, we were considering going to a hotel following the overnight flight to DFW. When checking the suitcase, I specifically asked the American Airlines agent ""if we only check this bag to DFW and then go to a hotel for a few hours of sleep, will we be charged a second baggage fee to check the bag in for the flight to Toronto? If so we can rearrange the bags so that we can just check it through to Toronto."" "

In the future, I will do all I can to avoid flying with your airline and don't count on a positive recommendation from me to others! Also, stop charging for the first piece of checked in luggage!"

Franco of Weston, FL," June 14, 2016","I was scheduled to fly out of Tampa International on Sunday, September, 17th to Durango, CO. I live in Sarasota, and just returned home the other day after evacuating for Hurricane Irma. I fled Florida and headed to Georgia, where I had to rent a hotel for a few nights. When I returned home I was fortunate enough not to have suffered damage. I of course have yard debris strewn about and I am still without power. The power company has estimated by the end of the day on September 22nd I will have power. With the extra costs incurred from having to leave my home, and the loss of power, I decided this was not a good time to travel."
anne of Wynnewood, PA," June 13, 2016","Hurricane Irma was mess for AA. I get it. I'm sure there were thousands who were stuck trying to get their flights changed. Unfortunately, I was in Costa Rica with a connection via Miami and I got, as the AA agent said ""the short end of the stick."" I would be stuck almost another week in Costa Rica as everything AA had was booked out or cancelled. I saw a little bit of silver lining when I found that if I could get to Mexico city, I could fly home via DFW. However, AA would not change the ticket as it is against their rules to change the country of origin on a ticket. ""We cannot do it."" However, a more accurate description is ""will not."""
michelle of Highland Park, IL," June 12, 2016","We were delayed on our AA out of Seattle due to having to wait on flight crew. Managed to make it to Dallas on time BUT had to sit on the tarmac for 20 mins waiting for a gait in order to deplane. This caused to miss our connecting flight. Next available flight is the next day. Asked about compensation for overnight hotel stay (there are 7 in our party, including a 3 year old) and were denied due to the delay being coded as weather related, which is absolutely bogus. So livid, frustrated, and tired at this point. Also found out AA has no number to call for complaints... You have to go through email so who knows if they will even read it or reply. Will never fly AA again if I can help it."
P. of Bloomfield, NJ," June 12, 2016","I was on an almost 2 hour flight (Flight AA3936) stuck sitting with one leg over my bag and the other on the edge of the aisle. Not once was I asked to check in my bag nor told it wouldn't fit on the overhead bin. By the time we landed my knees, hips and back were killing me and I had to have help from the gentleman next to me to be able to stand up. So glad there wasn't an emergency 'cause this would have been one hell of a hazard. Lesson learned not to use this airline again."
Rochelle of Bellflower, CA," June 12, 2016","American Airlines‰Û_the new standard for horrible service. Oh‰Û_I mean HORRIBLE! I travel very frequently for work and have stuck to one specific airline in order to build my status with them (ie. first class upgrades often, better seat choices, free checked bags). Recently, service has taken a turn for the worse. I‰Ûªm a reasonable guy and tolerate more than most. Call it my Southern hospitality, my upbringing or my service to the community when I served in law enforcement, but I just plain put up with more‰Û_until now."
Cynthia of Perrysburg, OH," June 9, 2016","I travel 80%~ for Work and have flown with almost every airline multiple times. AA is by far the worst. Not due to their customer service/staff/delays or anything like that (at least that I‰Ûªve noticed), but their planes have no entertainment system on each seat, they do not play movies on the overhead screens, and they don‰Ûªt even have a free WiFi movie/tv option you can connect to using your phone! I‰Ûªm currently on a flight from Boston to Phoenix and was utterly shocked when I sat in my seat and noticed no form of entertainment for a cross-country flight. Delta and other airlines provide personal entertainment screens on each screen or a smartphone connect feature for 2+ hr flights, which in turn make the flights more enjoyable. Anyways, to avoid rambling on and on about the lack of technology on AA planes I‰Ûªll just say if you enjoyed traveling in the late 90s early 2000s, then AA is for you. If you want to travel in 2017 and beyond, find a different airline."
Tania of Colorado Springs, CO," June 9, 2016","I had a horrible experience today on my flight back to Miami. I have been an AAdvantage member for many years now and have always chosen to be loyal to American but after today's experience that may change. The onboarding process was fine and the flight was on time, which to be honest is rare but I was happy. When the snacks and beverage cart came the attendant did not smile, looked unhappy to take our beverage order, handed me and my husband 2 cookies, I then I told her, ""Can we just get pretzels?"" She said ""Then I need the cookies back."" I was honestly appalled."
Camille of Seattle, WA," June 8, 2016","Don't deserve single star. Also, I have a flight from Chicago to Minneapolis 5 hours from now. And they have seats available on the earlier flight but won't give you without charging $75. They are ok to make you wait or fly a flight with empty seats but no customer delight which is no cost to them. No customer driven company and not looking for going extra mile to make customer happy. Never travel on American Airlines again."
Linnea of Seattle, WA," June 7, 2016","Worst experience ever with AA never again, they treated my dad like garbage, they humiliated my dad in front of my niece travelling with him and in front of all passengers, just because my dad is ** and not fluent in English. I wish I could sue them for discrimination against my dad for not speaking English fluent instead of offering assistance in Spanish which, the sky harbor airport in Arizona has plenty of bilingual employees. DO NOT FLY AA EVER, pay more with a different airline. The only reason why my dad and niece flew AA to go to my brother's funeral, thank you AA for the worst day ever. It's a shame I have to put a star instead of no stars service."
Timothy of Coppell, TX," June 6, 2016","This American Airlines review is out of frustration due to a lot of things. They're a disgrace! The employees are rude, there is no leg room, no entertainment, and treat people like herds of sheep. They have a ""New"" rule where they charge $50 at the gate to carry on your luggage. Are you kidding me? $50 for a carry on? And I can't even use the overhead bin! Disgraceful! Basically these guys are crooks! They're a disgrace. Last time I flew with American their flight was delayed by 2 hours and we ended up missing our connecting flight because it was the last flight out. We ended up having to stay an extra day and had to pay $100 for a hotel. We missed my sisters wedding. On the way back we ended up stuck on the tarmac for 2 hours. Of course!"
James of Williston, ND," June 6, 2016","I booked a ticket back when the hurricane were hitting down south every other week. Because of that I was not able to attend my trip in GA.

Mind you this is the highest rate out of all the airlines for my particular dates, I asked for a refund because I didn't wanna double what I paid the first time and I was told by the Supervisor (Willie ** in Dallas ) that my only option was to ""use it or lost it"". Being a supervisor myself I thought the tone in which he said it was very careless and he didn't try to help the situation at all.

Ittamar of Las Vegas, NV," May 23, 2016","I was scheduled to fly out of Tampa International on Sunday, September, 17th to Durango, CO. I live in Sarasota, and just returned home the other day after evacuating for Hurricane Irma. I fled Florida and headed to Georgia, where I had to rent a hotel for a few nights. When I returned home I was fortunate enough not to have suffered damage. I of course have yard debris strewn about and I am still without power. The power company has estimated by the end of the day on September 22nd I will have power. With the extra costs incurred from having to leave my home, and the loss of power, I decided this was not a good time to travel."
Ken of Burbank, CA," May 23, 2016","Hurricane Irma was mess for AA. I get it. I'm sure there were thousands who were stuck trying to get their flights changed. Unfortunately, I was in Costa Rica with a connection via Miami and I got, as the AA agent said ""the short end of the stick."" I would be stuck almost another week in Costa Rica as everything AA had was booked out or cancelled. I saw a little bit of silver lining when I found that if I could get to Mexico city, I could fly home via DFW. However, AA would not change the ticket as it is against their rules to change the country of origin on a ticket. ""We cannot do it."" However, a more accurate description is ""will not."""
M. S. of Linthicum, MD," May 22, 2016","We were delayed on our AA out of Seattle due to having to wait on flight crew. Managed to make it to Dallas on time BUT had to sit on the tarmac for 20 mins waiting for a gait in order to deplane. This caused to miss our connecting flight. Next available flight is the next day. Asked about compensation for overnight hotel stay (there are 7 in our party, including a 3 year old) and were denied due to the delay being coded as weather related, which is absolutely bogus. So livid, frustrated, and tired at this point. Also found out AA has no number to call for complaints... You have to go through email so who knows if they will even read it or reply. Will never fly AA again if I can help it."
Ed of Sherwood, OR," May 21, 2016","I was on an almost 2 hour flight (Flight AA3936) stuck sitting with one leg over my bag and the other on the edge of the aisle. Not once was I asked to check in my bag nor told it wouldn't fit on the overhead bin. By the time we landed my knees, hips and back were killing me and I had to have help from the gentleman next to me to be able to stand up. So glad there wasn't an emergency 'cause this would have been one hell of a hazard. Lesson learned not to use this airline again."
Wendy of Colchester, CT," May 20, 2016","American Airlines‰Û_the new standard for horrible service. Oh‰Û_I mean HORRIBLE! I travel very frequently for work and have stuck to one specific airline in order to build my status with them (ie. first class upgrades often, better seat choices, free checked bags). Recently, service has taken a turn for the worse. I‰Ûªm a reasonable guy and tolerate more than most. Call it my Southern hospitality, my upbringing or my service to the community when I served in law enforcement, but I just plain put up with more‰Û_until now."
Denise of Raleigh, NC," May 19, 2016","I travel 80%~ for Work and have flown with almost every airline multiple times. AA is by far the worst. Not due to their customer service/staff/delays or anything like that (at least that I‰Ûªve noticed), but their planes have no entertainment system on each seat, they do not play movies on the overhead screens, and they don‰Ûªt even have a free WiFi movie/tv option you can connect to using your phone! I‰Ûªm currently on a flight from Boston to Phoenix and was utterly shocked when I sat in my seat and noticed no form of entertainment for a cross-country flight. Delta and other airlines provide personal entertainment screens on each screen or a smartphone connect feature for 2+ hr flights, which in turn make the flights more enjoyable. Anyways, to avoid rambling on and on about the lack of technology on AA planes I‰Ûªll just say if you enjoyed traveling in the late 90s early 2000s, then AA is for you. If you want to travel in 2017 and beyond, find a different airline."
kenia of Miami Beach, FL," May 17, 2016","I had a horrible experience today on my flight back to Miami. I have been an AAdvantage member for many years now and have always chosen to be loyal to American but after today's experience that may change. The onboarding process was fine and the flight was on time, which to be honest is rare but I was happy. When the snacks and beverage cart came the attendant did not smile, looked unhappy to take our beverage order, handed me and my husband 2 cookies, I then I told her, ""Can we just get pretzels?"" She said ""Then I need the cookies back."" I was honestly appalled."
Pete of Bloomington, MN," May 16, 2016","Don't deserve single star. Also, I have a flight from Chicago to Minneapolis 5 hours from now. And they have seats available on the earlier flight but won't give you without charging $75. They are ok to make you wait or fly a flight with empty seats but no customer delight which is no cost to them. No customer driven company and not looking for going extra mile to make customer happy. Never travel on American Airlines again."
Lisa of Lawrenceville, NJ," May 12, 2016","Worst experience ever with AA never again, they treated my dad like garbage, they humiliated my dad in front of my niece travelling with him and in front of all passengers, just because my dad is ** and not fluent in English. I wish I could sue them for discrimination against my dad for not speaking English fluent instead of offering assistance in Spanish which, the sky harbor airport in Arizona has plenty of bilingual employees. DO NOT FLY AA EVER, pay more with a different airline. The only reason why my dad and niece flew AA to go to my brother's funeral, thank you AA for the worst day ever. It's a shame I have to put a star instead of no stars service."
Ruth of Reno, NV," May 12, 2016","This American Airlines review is out of frustration due to a lot of things. They're a disgrace! The employees are rude, there is no leg room, no entertainment, and treat people like herds of sheep. They have a ""New"" rule where they charge $50 at the gate to carry on your luggage. Are you kidding me? $50 for a carry on? And I can't even use the overhead bin! Disgraceful! Basically these guys are crooks! They're a disgrace. Last time I flew with American their flight was delayed by 2 hours and we ended up missing our connecting flight because it was the last flight out. We ended up having to stay an extra day and had to pay $100 for a hotel. We missed my sisters wedding. On the way back we ended up stuck on the tarmac for 2 hours. Of course!"
James of Marysville, WA," May 12, 2016","I booked a ticket back when the hurricane were hitting down south every other week. Because of that I was not able to attend my trip in GA. They told me I had up to a year to use my ticket. So when I try to rebook my ticket they are now close to $500. Mind you this is the highest rate out of all the airlines for my particular dates, I asked for a refund because I didn't wanna double what I paid the first time and I was told by the Supervisor (Willie ** in Dallas ) that my only option was to ""use it or lost it"". Being a supervisor myself I thought the tone in which he said it was very careless and he didn't try to help the situation at all. I would never talk to my customers the way he spoke to me especially after losing out on $300!!"
Angela of Elpaso, TX," May 11, 2016","I just completed a flight on American Airlines. I had read negative reviews, but I found the American Airlines people I had contact with were great, tried to provide all the service they could because our flight had been cancelled due WX and had to layover at ORD. My complaint is the phoney coupon given for a hotel room for a ""discounted rate"". The coupon has nothing to do with American Airlines, but is only a hotel booking service. When I called the phone number provided I was told the only available room was 10 miles away and given a rate of $80.00. It was getting late in the evening so took it. Then was advised there was a $15 service charge to book the room. American Airline paid none of this. The shuttle bus to the hotel was packed (Other delayed passengers). When I got home I checked the hotel rate and found the same room went for $105. I ""saved"" $10. The hotel was a Holiday Inn Express. Room not bad."

She made up some baloney about Homeland Security not letting people fly with spots on their passport. I told her I checked their website and there was no mention of anything like that. She then claimed, ""Oh, they don't tell you."" I said, ""Then how are you supposed to know?""

I wanted to fly back before my actual trip date, due to obvious reasons. I even offered to provide them with a death certificate if need be (although, I don't think that is even something they should ask for right away). I spoke to 3 different customer service reps who were all horrible to speak with. They had zero compassion and empathy and just dismissed me as if what I was experiencing was far from a big deal to them. "

Cindy of Raleigh, NC," May 3, 2016","Overall, (Un)American Airlines continues to disappoint. I really only ever fly with AA as a last resort, and I can't see any reason to recommend traveling with AA. I was prior active duty Army, and now I'm a reservist, and only American Airlines makes me feel like my service is less important now. United, Southwest, Jet Blue, Delta, every other airline doesn't discriminate between Active Duty and Reserve/Guardsmen when it comes to bag fees. So, along with uncomfortable, outdated planes and poor service, I spent a $100 checking bags to and from my destination."
Bent of San Juan Capistrano, CA," May 1, 2016",American Airlines is the worst airlines to fly anywhere. They cram you in the seats with no leg room or any room for that matter. I requested a wheelchair at airport and waited 30 minutes upon someone finally arriving. They took me the wrong way to my next check in and I missed my flight. They said I would have to rebook my ticket and just wait for the next flight. Attendant at the gate was very disrespectful and not helpful at all. I had no control over this situation at all. Not to mention when I did finally arrive at my destination that I requested a wheelchair prior to my departure.
Joseph of Ravenel, SC," April 30, 2016","American Airlines is the worst airline in THE WORLD, and should change their name, it is utterly disgraceful that as an American they use this name. Their policy is to not apologize for anything, to be as rude as possible to people who are basically held hostage to them and their BS policies like closing the door to the gate while people are standing there then charging them money to rebook their flight, not caring at all about the bags on their way to a destination without the owners there to pick them up. Then being told when lodging a complaint that it was going in one ear and out the other. I have never been treated so poorly in my life, I will never again fly with this airline, I hope they go bankrupt and get the worst karma life can give. Oh yeah and I get to fly with them tomorrow. :/"
T. S. of Morton, IL," April 30, 2016","Very disappointed. Unlikely I will ever choose American Airlines again. I didn't make my flight in the spring. I was given a voucher to use for future travel. Now I'm being told I can only use it myself, and not for my family. I don't want to use it for myself. What difference does it make? I'm being told different things by different people. The last guy hung up on me and I wasn't even rude to him. This is how AA does business? All I want is to not be penalized for cancelling a flight that was beyond my control. If you have a voucher it should be flexible to use for anyone. AA is the WORST! Hope they go out of business for this nonsense. Airline travel is a joke."
Dan of Alameda, CA," April 30, 2016","American Airlines canceled my 92-year-old father-in-law's flight to Key West due to Hurricane Irma. On that day American Airline was contacted and the representative said there would be no problem re-booking, just use the reference number. American Airlines even went on TV and said they would waive re-booking fees. Today when calling to re-book the flight and after 57 minutes on the phone, I was told the flight could not be re-booked because it was in their notes I requested a refund. At no time did I request a refund and American Airlines could not locate any record of a refund request. Even so, American Airlines still insisted they could not re-book the flight or issue a refund. If we did not have enough trouble dealing with a Cat 4 hurricane and its devastating aftermath, now American Airlines is adding to the misery. All my father-in-law wants is to come to Key West and see that everyone is alright. Thanks, AA."
derek of Mission, KS," April 27, 2016",I bought tickets for my mother in law and son to meet my wife and I in Colorado. We had traveled on different airlines due to connections and therefore were going back on different airlines. My wife and I left on our airplane. My mother in law and son were stranded as the plane had a mechanical. This was 8 AM and the bottom line was it didn't get fixed that day. American gave them a 12.00 voucher good in the terminal and did nothing to get them a room as the rooms they usually used weren't available.
Stephanie of West Palm Beach, FL," April 23, 2016","I booked 2 separate flights on American Airlines in Economy since I pay for my air travel. On one they pre-assigned me a back-of-plane middle seat and said that I was required to pay some increased fee for window, aisle or closer to the front. On the second flight they said I have to wait until I reach the boarding gate for any seat. This is ridiculous and unacceptable. The airline has sufficient revenue to - just a suggestion - increase the ""base"" fare to cover a first-come-first-served seat selection and not put everyone into 3rd class or worse status. If they want to surcharge certain premium seats, like middle seats toward the front, that's OK, but this behavior is totally unacceptable and I refuse to fly them (or any airline) that abuses their passengers."
Jane of Tulsa, OK," April 22, 2016",Well I looked into changing my flight for my fiance and I to go home a day earlier... only to discover that American charges $200.00 a ticket PLUS the difference in price tickets!

I have already paid for a flight and now you are trying to rip me off even more!?! Out of touch and terrible service to a customer of over 5 years. I will be going elsewhere where I don't get bent over the table. Thank you American!

Kim of Providence, RI," April 18, 2016",My husband and I were scheduled to fly out at 7:15 am to go to California for a very important family matter. We do not live near the airport so we were up early to make sure we were early and nothing could go wrong. But things did go wrong. When we got to the airport we went and printed out tickets at the self checkout. We did notice that it mentioned no overhead storage for our carry on bags. So confused because we fly a lot and there is always overhead storage or they place in under the cabin. So we asked a lady that was standing in the area of self print and she looked and our tickets said we would be fine... Again we were told wrong.

Four of us had carry-on sized luggage but one had a mid-sized suitcase that we knew we would have to check. Our flight to Toronto included a 12.5-hour connection at DFW (not by choice). Since none of us sleep well on planes, we were considering going to a hotel following the overnight flight to DFW. When checking the suitcase, I specifically asked the American Airlines agent ""if we only check this bag to DFW and then go to a hotel for a few hours of sleep, will we be charged a second baggage fee to check the bag in for the flight to Toronto? If so we can rearrange the bags so that we can just check it through to Toronto."" "

They said I would have to rebook my ticket and just wait for the next flight. Attendant at the gate was very disrespectful and not helpful at all. I had no control over this situation at all. Not to mention when I did finally arrive at my destination that I requested a wheelchair prior to my departure.
Pam of Smyrna, DE," March 27, 2016","American Airlines is the worst airline in THE WORLD, and should change their name, it is utterly disgraceful that as an American they use this name. Their policy is to not apologize for anything, to be as rude as possible to people who are basically held hostage to them and their BS policies like closing the door to the gate while people are standing there then charging them money to rebook their flight, not caring at all about the bags on their way to a destination without the owners there to pick them up. Then being told when lodging a complaint that it was going in one ear and out the other. I have never been treated so poorly in my life, I will never again fly with this airline, I hope they go bankrupt and get the worst karma life can give. Oh yeah and I get to fly with them tomorrow. :/"
Stacey of Lees Summit, MO," March 26, 2016","Very disappointed. Unlikely I will ever choose American Airlines again. I didn't make my flight in the spring. I was given a voucher to use for future travel. Now I'm being told I can only use it myself, and not for my family. I don't want to use it for myself. What difference does it make? I'm being told different things by different people. The last guy hung up on me and I wasn't even rude to him. This is how AA does business? All I want is to not be penalized for cancelling a flight that was beyond my control. If you have a voucher it should be flexible to use for anyone. AA is the WORST! Hope they go out of business for this nonsense. Airline travel is a joke."
Trina of Halifax, NS," March 25, 2016","American Airlines canceled my 92-year-old father-in-law's flight to Key West due to Hurricane Irma. On that day American Airline was contacted and the representative said there would be no problem re-booking, just use the reference number. American Airlines even went on TV and said they would waive re-booking fees. Today when calling to re-book the flight and after 57 minutes on the phone, I was told the flight could not be re-booked because it was in their notes I requested a refund. At no time did I request a refund and American Airlines could not locate any record of a refund request. Even so, American Airlines still insisted they could not re-book the flight or issue a refund. If we did not have enough trouble dealing with a Cat 4 hurricane and its devastating aftermath, now American Airlines is adding to the misery. All my father-in-law wants is to come to Key West and see that everyone is alright. Thanks, AA."
Adrienne of Lake Zurich, IL," March 25, 2016",I bought tickets for my mother in law and son to meet my wife and I in Colorado. We had traveled on different airlines due to connections and therefore were going back on different airlines. My wife and I left on our airplane. My mother in law and son were stranded as the plane had a mechanical. This was 8 AM and the bottom line was it didn't get fixed that day. American gave them a 12.00 voucher good in the terminal and did nothing to get them a room as the rooms they usually used weren't available.
Frederick William (Bill) of Tampa, FL," March 25, 2016","I booked 2 separate flights on American Airlines in Economy since I pay for my air travel. On one they pre-assigned me a back-of-plane middle seat and said that I was required to pay some increased fee for window, aisle or closer to the front. On the second flight they said I have to wait until I reach the boarding gate for any seat. This is ridiculous and unacceptable. The airline has sufficient revenue to - just a suggestion - increase the ""base"" fare to cover a first-come-first-served seat selection and not put everyone into 3rd class or worse status. If they want to surcharge certain premium seats, like middle seats toward the front, that's OK, but this behavior is totally unacceptable and I refuse to fly them (or any airline) that abuses their passengers."
Blair of Bethlehem, Pennsylvania," March 25, 2016",Well I looked into changing my flight for my fiance and I to go home a day earlier... only to discover that American charges $200.00 a ticket PLUS the difference in price tickets! LIKE THAT IS GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE! So for the price of another ticket I can change my flight! I will be looking elsewhere for flights in the future. I have already paid for a flight and now you are trying to rip me off even more!?! Out of touch and terrible service to a customer of over 5 years. I will be going elsewhere where I don't get bent over the table. Thank you American!
Carlos of Buffalo, NY," March 25, 2016","I originally booked my flight to Miami from Washington, DC back in July 2017. I was scheduled to fly September 13-18, 2017. I, like many, had to cancel my trip because of hurricane Irma. I was informed by two customer service representatives that I would be able to rebook my flight to Miami with no additional charges in fare and no change fees. Of course, when it comes time to book my flight, I'm informed about a change fee. I told the agent, I was reassured twice that I would not be charged any additional fees because my initial cancellation was weather related. "
Carmen of Doral, Florida," March 25, 2016","American Airlines is full of **. Our cruise was cancelled due to Hurricane Irma. It was beyond our control and the airline stated there was nothing that they could do. No partial credit, changes or anything! I will not be flying with them anymore!"
Chuck of Santa Cruz, CA," March 25, 2016",My husband and I were scheduled to fly out at 7:15 am to go to California for a very important family matter. We do not live near the airport so we were up early to make sure we were early and nothing could go wrong. But things did go wrong. When we got to the airport we went and printed out tickets at the self checkout. We did notice that it mentioned no overhead storage for our carry on bags. So confused because we fly a lot and there is always overhead storage or they place in under the cabin. So we asked a lady that was standing in the area of self print and she looked and our tickets said we would be fine... Again we were told wrong.
Joe of Littleton, MA," March 25, 2016","On September 4 my family of 5 arrived at the airport in Anchorage to fly home to Toronto via Dallas. Four of us had carry-on sized luggage but one had a mid-sized suitcase that we knew we would have to check. Our flight to Toronto included a 12.5-hour connection at DFW (not by choice). Since none of us sleep well on planes, we were considering going to a hotel following the overnight flight to DFW. When checking the suitcase, I specifically asked the American Airlines agent ""if we only check this bag to DFW and then go to a hotel for a few hours of sleep, will we be charged a second baggage fee to check the bag in for the flight to Toronto? If so we can rearrange the bags so that we can just check it through to Toronto."" "
Lucas of Blue Bell, PA," March 25, 2016","I purchased the basic economy ticket. When I was getting ready to board in Charlotte, the attendant mentioned that this was a new program for your airline and that customers have stated it was cost effective. However, this was not my case! I paid nearly $600 to fly from Columbus, OH to Asheville, NC. Absolutely absurd!!! In the future, I will do all I can to avoid flying with your airline and don't count on a positive recommendation from me to others! Also, stop charging for the first piece of checked in luggage!"
Richelle of Ashland City, TN," March 25, 2016","I did a reservation with AA Sept 10, 2017 over the phone to Miami for Sept 12, 2017 in the flight # 1399. September 11 I checked the flight online and it was canceled. I called customer service. Patricia told me that I was wrong it wasn't cancel. I called at night again because I was worried I saw it was still cancel. After almost 2 hours they answered the phone. I told them what happened. They told me that they were very sorry but the flight was canceled and they didnt' have flight for Sept 12. They gave me 1 stop flight for Sept 13. "
Joseph of Woburn, MA," March 24, 2016","I was scheduled to fly out of Tampa International on Sunday, September, 17th to Durango, CO. I live in Sarasota, and just returned home the other day after evacuating for Hurricane Irma. I fled Florida and headed to Georgia, where I had to rent a hotel for a few nights. When I returned home I was fortunate enough not to have suffered damage. I of course have yard debris strewn about and I am still without power. The power company has estimated by the end of the day on September 22nd I will have power. With the extra costs incurred from having to leave my home, and the loss of power, I decided this was not a good time to travel."
Alexei of Rsm, CA," March 24, 2016","Hurricane Irma was mess for AA. I get it. I'm sure there were thousands who were stuck trying to get their flights changed. Unfortunately, I was in Costa Rica with a connection via Miami and I got, as the AA agent said ""the short end of the stick."" I would be stuck almost another week in Costa Rica as everything AA had was booked out or cancelled. I saw a little bit of silver lining when I found that if I could get to Mexico city, I could fly home via DFW. However, AA would not change the ticket as it is against their rules to change the country of origin on a ticket. ""We cannot do it."" However, a more accurate description is ""will not."""
Jim of Mooredtown, NJ," March 22, 2016","We were delayed on our AA out of Seattle due to having to wait on flight crew. Managed to make it to Dallas on time BUT had to sit on the tarmac for 20 mins waiting for a gait in order to deplane. This caused to miss our connecting flight. Next available flight is the next day. Asked about compensation for overnight hotel stay (there are 7 in our party, including a 3 year old) and were denied due to the delay being coded as weather related, which is absolutely bogus. So livid, frustrated, and tired at this point. Also found out AA has no number to call for complaints... You have to go through email so who knows if they will even read it or reply. Will never fly AA again if I can help it."
Yingchun of Scottsdale, AZ," March 21, 2016","I was on an almost 2 hour flight (Flight AA3936) stuck sitting with one leg over my bag and the other on the edge of the aisle. Not once was I asked to check in my bag nor told it wouldn't fit on the overhead bin. By the time we landed my knees, hips and back were killing me and I had to have help from the gentleman next to me to be able to stand up. So glad there wasn't an emergency 'cause this would have been one hell of a hazard. Lesson learned not to use this airline again."
KARLYN of College Park, GA," March 21, 2016","American Airlines‰Û_the new standard for horrible service. Oh‰Û_I mean HORRIBLE! I travel very frequently for work and have stuck to one specific airline in order to build my status with them (ie. first class upgrades often, better seat choices, free checked bags). Recently, service has taken a turn for the worse. I‰Ûªm a reasonable guy and tolerate more than most. Call it my Southern hospitality, my upbringing or my service to the community when I served in law enforcement, but I just plain put up with more‰Û_until now."
VAN of Safety Harbor, FL," March 20, 2016","I travel 80%~ for Work and have flown with almost every airline multiple times. AA is by far the worst. Not due to their customer service/staff/delays or anything like that (at least that I‰Ûªve noticed), but their planes have no entertainment system on each seat, they do not play movies on the overhead screens, and they don‰Ûªt even have a free WiFi movie/tv option you can connect to using your phone! I‰Ûªm currently on a flight from Boston to Phoenix and was utterly shocked when I sat in my seat and noticed no form of entertainment for a cross-country flight. Delta and other airlines provide personal entertainment screens on each screen or a smartphone connect feature for 2+ hr flights, which in turn make the flights more enjoyable. Anyways, to avoid rambling on and on about the lack of technology on AA planes I‰Ûªll just say if you enjoyed traveling in the late 90s early 2000s, then AA is for you. If you want to travel in 2017 and beyond, find a different airline."
Olivia of Vacaville, CA," March 19, 2016","I had a horrible experience today on my flight back to Miami. I have been an AAdvantage member for many years now and have always chosen to be loyal to American but after today's experience that may change. The onboarding process was fine and the flight was on time, which to be honest is rare but I was happy. When the snacks and beverage cart came the attendant did not smile, looked unhappy to take our beverage order, handed me and my husband 2 cookies, I then I told her, ""Can we just get pretzels?"" She said ""Then I need the cookies back."" I was honestly appalled."
Riley of Franklin, OH," March 17, 2016","Don't deserve single star. Also, I have a flight from Chicago to Minneapolis 5 hours from now. And they have seats available on the earlier flight but won't give you without charging $75. They are ok to make you wait or fly a flight with empty seats but no customer delight which is no cost to them. No customer driven company and not looking for going extra mile to make customer happy. Never travel on American Airlines again."
Sunila of Skokie, IL," March 16, 2016","Worst experience ever with AA never again, they treated my dad like garbage, they humiliated my dad in front of my niece travelling with him and in front of all passengers, just because my dad is ** and not fluent in English. I wish I could sue them for discrimination against my dad for not speaking English fluent instead of offering assistance in Spanish which, the sky harbor airport in Arizona has plenty of bilingual employees. DO NOT FLY AA EVER, pay more with a different airline. The only reason why my dad and niece flew AA to go to my brother's funeral, thank you AA for the worst day ever. It's a shame I have to put a star instead of no stars service."
Michaela of London, Other," March 15, 2016","This American Airlines review is out of frustration due to a lot of things. They're a disgrace! The employees are rude, there is no leg room, no entertainment, and treat people like herds of sheep. They have a ""New"" rule where they charge $50 at the gate to carry on your luggage. Are you kidding me? $50 for a carry on? And I can't even use the overhead bin! Disgraceful! Basically these guys are crooks! They're a disgrace. Last time I flew with American their flight was delayed by 2 hours and we ended up missing our connecting flight because it was the last flight out. We ended up having to stay an extra day and had to pay $100 for a hotel. We missed my sisters wedding. On the way back we ended up stuck on the tarmac for 2 hours. Of course!"
Katey of Pea Ridge, AR," March 15, 2016","I booked a ticket back when the hurricane were hitting down south every other week. Because of that I was not able to attend my trip in GA. They told me I had up to a year to use my ticket. So when I try to rebook my ticket they are now close to $500. Mind you this is the highest rate out of all the airlines for my particular dates, I asked for a refund because I didn't wanna double what I paid the first time and I was told by the Supervisor (Willie ** in Dallas ) that my only option was to ""use it or lost it"". Being a supervisor myself I thought the tone in which he said it was very careless and he didn't try to help the situation at all. I would never talk to my customers the way he spoke to me especially after losing out on $300!!"
Jacquie of Valley Falls Ny, NY," March 14, 2016","I just completed a flight on American Airlines. I had read negative reviews, but I found the American Airlines people I had contact with were great, tried to provide all the service they could because our flight had been cancelled due WX and had to layover at ORD. My complaint is the phoney coupon given for a hotel room for a ""discounted rate"". The coupon has nothing to do with American Airlines, but is only a hotel booking service. When I called the phone number provided I was told the only available room was 10 miles away and given a rate of $80.00. It was getting late in the evening so took it. Then was advised there was a $15 service charge to book the room. American Airline paid none of this. The shuttle bus to the hotel was packed (Other delayed passengers). When I got home I checked the hotel rate and found the same room went for $105. I ""saved"" $10. The hotel was a Holiday Inn Express. Room not bad."
Maris of Atlanta, GA," March 14, 2016","I was en route from San Antonio Texas to Hong Kong and when checking in for the domestic portion of the flight at the ticket counter, the woman claimed there was a problem with my passport. I asked for details and she claimed ""There are spots on your passport."" I told her the passport was still valid and did not expire until the following year."" She made up some baloney about Homeland Security not letting people fly with spots on their passport. I told her I checked their website and there was no mention of anything like that. She then claimed, ""Oh, they don't tell you."" I said, ""Then how are you supposed to know?"" She then sarcastically claimed I needed glasses, so I put my glasses on and told her those so called spots are not a problem. "

While I was away, I heard the news that my dad had passed away. In which, I contacted American Airlines right away and asked if anything can be done. I wanted to fly back before my actual trip date, due to obvious reasons. I even offered to provide them with a death certificate if need be (although, I don't think that is even something they should ask for right away). I spoke to 3 different customer service reps who were all horrible to speak with. They had zero compassion and empathy and just dismissed me as if what I was experiencing was far from a big deal to them. "
luigi of Elmont , NY," March 10, 2016","I was on the plane for 14 hours due to a delay. Sitting in a broken seat that would not recline. I told the stewardess and she could care less, said nothing she can do. After I got home I contacted the airline and they issued me a fourteen dollar credit. I had paid 197.34 dollars for preferred seats. The worst flight of my life, never again w/ this airline."
Chris of Astoria, NY," March 9, 2016","Overall, (Un)American Airlines continues to disappoint. I really only ever fly with AA as a last resort, and I can't see any reason to recommend traveling with AA. I was prior active duty Army, and now I'm a reservist, and only American Airlines makes me feel like my service is less important now. United, Southwest, Jet Blue, Delta, every other airline doesn't discriminate between Active Duty and Reserve/Guardsmen when it comes to bag fees. So, along with uncomfortable, outdated planes and poor service, I spent a $100 checking bags to and from my destination."

Not due to their customer service/staff/delays or anything like that (at least that I‰Ûªve noticed), but their planes have no entertainment system on each seat, they do not play movies on the overhead screens, and they don‰Ûªt even have a free WiFi movie/tv option you can connect to using your phone! I‰Ûªm currently on a flight from Boston to Phoenix and was utterly shocked when I sat in my seat and noticed no form of entertainment for a cross-country flight. Delta and other airlines provide personal entertainment screens on each screen or a smartphone connect feature for 2+ hr flights, which in turn make the flights more enjoyable. Anyways, to avoid rambling on and on about the lack of technology on AA planes I‰Ûªll just say if you enjoyed traveling in the late 90s early 2000s, then AA is for you. If you want to travel in 2017 and beyond, find a different airline."
Jon of Smithfield, VA," Feb. 19, 2016","I had a horrible experience today on my flight back to Miami. I have been an AAdvantage member for many years now and have always chosen to be loyal to American but after today's experience that may change. The onboarding process was fine and the flight was on time, which to be honest is rare but I was happy. When the snacks and beverage cart came the attendant did not smile, looked unhappy to take our beverage order, handed me and my husband 2 cookies, I then I told her, ""Can we just get pretzels?"" She said ""Then I need the cookies back."" I was honestly appalled."
Shelly-Ann of Smyrna, GA," Feb. 19, 2016","Don't deserve single star. Also, I have a flight from Chicago to Minneapolis 5 hours from now. And they have seats available on the earlier flight but won't give you without charging $75. They are ok to make you wait or fly a flight with empty seats but no customer delight which is no cost to them. No customer driven company and not looking for going extra mile to make customer happy. Never travel on American Airlines again."
michael of Miami, FL," Feb. 18, 2016","Worst experience ever with AA never again, they treated my dad like garbage, they humiliated my dad in front of my niece travelling with him and in front of all passengers, just because my dad is ** and not fluent in English. I wish I could sue them for discrimination against my dad for not speaking English fluent instead of offering assistance in Spanish which, the sky harbor airport in Arizona has plenty of bilingual employees. DO NOT FLY AA EVER, pay more with a different airline. The only reason why my dad and niece flew AA to go to my brother's funeral, thank you AA for the worst day ever. It's a shame I have to put a star instead of no stars service."
D.L. of Fort Lauderdale , FL," Feb. 18, 2016","This American Airlines review is out of frustration due to a lot of things. They're a disgrace! The employees are rude, there is no leg room, no entertainment, and treat people like herds of sheep. They have a ""New"" rule where they charge $50 at the gate to carry on your luggage. Are you kidding me? $50 for a carry on? And I can't even use the overhead bin! Disgraceful! Basically these guys are crooks! They're a disgrace. Last time I flew with American their flight was delayed by 2 hours and we ended up missing our connecting flight because it was the last flight out. We ended up having to stay an extra day and had to pay $100 for a hotel. We missed my sisters wedding. On the way back we ended up stuck on the tarmac for 2 hours. Of course!"
Chris of Rio Linda, CA," Feb. 17, 2016","I booked a ticket back when the hurricane were hitting down south every other week. Because of that I was not able to attend my trip in GA. They told me I had up to a year to use my ticket. So when I try to rebook my ticket they are now close to $500. Mind you this is the highest rate out of all the airlines for my particular dates, I asked for a refund because I didn't wanna double what I paid the first time and I was told by the Supervisor (Willie ** in Dallas ) that my only option was to ""use it or lost it"". Being a supervisor myself I thought the tone in which he said it was very careless and he didn't try to help the situation at all. I would never talk to my customers the way he spoke to me especially after losing out on $300!!"
Peg of Cave Creek, AZ," Feb. 17, 2016","I just completed a flight on American Airlines. I had read negative reviews, but I found the American Airlines people I had contact with were great, tried to provide all the service they could because our flight had been cancelled due WX and had to layover at ORD. My complaint is the phoney coupon given for a hotel room for a ""discounted rate"". The coupon has nothing to do with American Airlines, but is only a hotel booking service. When I called the phone number provided I was told the only available room was 10 miles away and given a rate of $80.00. It was getting late in the evening so took it. Then was advised there was a $15 service charge to book the room. American Airline paid none of this. The shuttle bus to the hotel was packed (Other delayed passengers). When I got home I checked the hotel rate and found the same room went for $105. I ""saved"" $10. The hotel was a Holiday Inn Express. Room not bad."

She made up some baloney about Homeland Security not letting people fly with spots on their passport. I told her I checked their website and there was no mention of anything like that. She then claimed, ""Oh, they don't tell you."" I said, ""Then how are you supposed to know?""

While I was away, I heard the news that my dad had passed away. In which, I contacted American Airlines right away and asked if anything can be done. I wanted to fly back before my actual trip date, due to obvious reasons. I even offered to provide them with a death certificate if need be (although, I don't think that is even something they should ask for right away). I spoke to 3 different customer service reps who were all horrible to speak with. They had zero compassion and empathy and just dismissed me as if what I was experiencing was far from a big deal to them. "
Gretchen of Newton, MA," Feb. 14, 2016","I was on the plane for 14 hours due to a delay. Sitting in a broken seat that would not recline. I told the stewardess and she could care less, said nothing she can do. After I got home I contacted the airline and they issued me a fourteen dollar credit. I had paid 197.34 dollars for preferred seats. The worst flight of my life, never again w/ this airline."
chaim of Lakewood, NJ," Feb. 14, 2016","Overall, (Un)American Airlines continues to disappoint. I really only ever fly with AA as a last resort, and I can't see any reason to recommend traveling with AA. I was prior active duty Army, and now I'm a reservist, and only American Airlines makes me feel like my service is less important now. United, Southwest, Jet Blue, Delta, every other airline doesn't discriminate between Active Duty and Reserve/Guardsmen when it comes to bag fees. So, along with uncomfortable, outdated planes and poor service, I spent a $100 checking bags to and from my destination."
Bryan of Cerritos, CA," Feb. 12, 2016",American Airlines is the worst airlines to fly anywhere. They cram you in the seats with no leg room or any room for that matter. I requested a wheelchair at airport and waited 30 minutes upon someone finally arriving. They took me the wrong way to my next check in and I missed my flight. They said I would have to rebook my ticket and just wait for the next flight. Attendant at the gate was very disrespectful and not helpful at all. I had no control over this situation at all. Not to mention when I did finally arrive at my destination that I requested a wheelchair prior to my departure.
Nanette of Amesbury, MA," Feb. 11, 2016","American Airlines is the worst airline in THE WORLD, and should change their name, it is utterly disgraceful that as an American they use this name. Their policy is to not apologize for anything, to be as rude as possible to people who are basically held hostage to them and their BS policies like closing the door to the gate while people are standing there then charging them money to rebook their flight, not caring at all about the bags on their way to a destination without the owners there to pick them up. Then being told when lodging a complaint that it was going in one ear and out the other. I have never been treated so poorly in my life, I will never again fly with this airline, I hope they go bankrupt and get the worst karma life can give. Oh yeah and I get to fly with them tomorrow. :/"
Margaret of Oakland, CA," Feb. 11, 2016","Very disappointed. Unlikely I will ever choose American Airlines again. I didn't make my flight in the spring. I was given a voucher to use for future travel. Now I'm being told I can only use it myself, and not for my family. I don't want to use it for myself. What difference does it make? I'm being told different things by different people. The last guy hung up on me and I wasn't even rude to him. This is how AA does business? All I want is to not be penalized for cancelling a flight that was beyond my control. If you have a voucher it should be flexible to use for anyone. AA is the WORST! Hope they go out of business for this nonsense. Airline travel is a joke."
MARIA CRISTINA of Rome, Other," Feb. 10, 2016","American Airlines canceled my 92-year-old father-in-law's flight to Key West due to Hurricane Irma. On that day American Airline was contacted and the representative said there would be no problem re-booking, just use the reference number. American Airlines even went on TV and said they would waive re-booking fees. Today when calling to re-book the flight and after 57 minutes on the phone, I was told the flight could not be re-booked because it was in their notes I requested a refund. At no time did I request a refund and American Airlines could not locate any record of a refund request. Even so, American Airlines still insisted they could not re-book the flight or issue a refund. If we did not have enough trouble dealing with a Cat 4 hurricane and its devastating aftermath, now American Airlines is adding to the misery. All my father-in-law wants is to come to Key West and see that everyone is alright. Thanks, AA."
Jon of Arlington, VA," Feb. 10, 2016",I bought tickets for my mother in law and son to meet my wife and I in Colorado. We had traveled on different airlines due to connections and therefore were going back on different airlines. My wife and I left on our airplane. My mother in law and son were stranded as the plane had a mechanical. This was 8 AM and the bottom line was it didn't get fixed that day. American gave them a 12.00 voucher good in the terminal and did nothing to get them a room as the rooms they usually used weren't available.
George of Longview, TX," Feb. 10, 2016","I booked 2 separate flights on American Airlines in Economy since I pay for my air travel. On one they pre-assigned me a back-of-plane middle seat and said that I was required to pay some increased fee for window, aisle or closer to the front. On the second flight they said I have to wait until I reach the boarding gate for any seat. This is ridiculous and unacceptable. The airline has sufficient revenue to - just a suggestion - increase the ""base"" fare to cover a first-come-first-served seat selection and not put everyone into 3rd class or worse status. If they want to surcharge certain premium seats, like middle seats toward the front, that's OK, but this behavior is totally unacceptable and I refuse to fly them (or any airline) that abuses their passengers."
Maria of Gurnee, IL," Feb. 9, 2016",Well I looked into changing my flight for my fiance and I to go home a day earlier... only to discover that American charges $200.00 a ticket PLUS the difference in price tickets! LIKE THAT IS GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE! So for the price of another ticket I can change my flight! I will be looking elsewhere for flights in the future. I have already paid for a flight and now you are trying to rip me off even more!?! Out of touch and terrible service to a customer of over 5 years. I will be going elsewhere where I don't get bent over the table. Thank you American!
will of Boise, ID," Feb. 7, 2016","I originally booked my flight to Miami from Washington, DC back in July 2017. I was scheduled to fly September 13-18, 2017. I, like many, had to cancel my trip because of hurricane Irma. I was informed by two customer service representatives that I would be able to rebook my flight to Miami with no additional charges in fare and no change fees. Of course, when it comes time to book my flight, I'm informed about a change fee. I told the agent, I was reassured twice that I would not be charged any additional fees because my initial cancellation was weather related. "
David of Alice Springs, Other," Feb. 6, 2016","American Airlines is full of **. Our cruise was cancelled due to Hurricane Irma. It was beyond our control and the airline stated there was nothing that they could do. No partial credit, changes or anything! I will not be flying with them anymore!"
Ty of Bridgeport, CT," Feb. 5, 2016",My husband and I were scheduled to fly out at 7:15 am to go to California for a very important family matter. We do not live near the airport so we were up early to make sure we were early and nothing could go wrong. But things did go wrong. When we got to the airport we went and printed out tickets at the self checkout. We did notice that it mentioned no overhead storage for our carry on bags. So confused because we fly a lot and there is always overhead storage or they place in under the cabin. So we asked a lady that was standing in the area of self print and she looked and our tickets said we would be fine... Again we were told wrong.
Abigail of Brooklyn, NY," Feb. 3, 2016","On September 4 my family of 5 arrived at the airport in Anchorage to fly home to Toronto via Dallas. Four of us had carry-on sized luggage but one had a mid-sized suitcase that we knew we would have to check. Our flight to Toronto included a 12.5-hour connection at DFW (not by choice). Since none of us sleep well on planes, we were considering going to a hotel following the overnight flight to DFW. When checking the suitcase, I specifically asked the American Airlines agent ""if we only check this bag to DFW and then go to a hotel for a few hours of sleep, will we be charged a second baggage fee to check the bag in for the flight to Toronto? If so we can rearrange the bags so that we can just check it through to Toronto."" "
Leslie of Mars, PA," Feb. 2, 2016","I purchased the basic economy ticket. When I was getting ready to board in Charlotte, the attendant mentioned that this was a new program for your airline and that customers have stated it was cost effective. However, this was not my case! I paid nearly $600 to fly from Columbus, OH to Asheville, NC. Absolutely absurd!!! In the future, I will do all I can to avoid flying with your airline and don't count on a positive recommendation from me to others! Also, stop charging for the first piece of checked in luggage!"

I called at night again because I was worried I saw it was still cancel. After almost 2 hours they answered the phone. I told them what happened. They told me that they were very sorry but the flight was canceled and they didnt' have flight for Sept 12. They gave me 1 stop flight for Sept 13. "
SJ of Cedarhurst, NY," Feb. 2, 2016","I was scheduled to fly out of Tampa International on Sunday, September, 17th to Durango, CO. I live in Sarasota, and just returned home the other day after evacuating for Hurricane Irma. I fled Florida and headed to Georgia, where I had to rent a hotel for a few nights. When I returned home I was fortunate enough not to have suffered damage. I of course have yard debris strewn about and I am still without power. The power company has estimated by the end of the day on September 22nd I will have power. With the extra costs incurred from having to leave my home, and the loss of power, I decided this was not a good time to travel."
Shay of Toms River, NJ," Feb. 1, 2016","Hurricane Irma was mess for AA. I get it. I'm sure there were thousands who were stuck trying to get their flights changed. Unfortunately, I was in Costa Rica with a connection via Miami and I got, as the AA agent said ""the short end of the stick."" I would be stuck almost another week in Costa Rica as everything AA had was booked out or cancelled. I saw a little bit of silver lining when I found that if I could get to Mexico city, I could fly home via DFW. However, AA would not change the ticket as it is against their rules to change the country of origin on a ticket. ""We cannot do it."" However, a more accurate description is ""will not."""
Frank of N/A, NY," Jan. 31, 2016","We were delayed on our AA out of Seattle due to having to wait on flight crew. Managed to make it to Dallas on time BUT had to sit on the tarmac for 20 mins waiting for a gait in order to deplane. This caused to miss our connecting flight. Next available flight is the next day. Asked about compensation for overnight hotel stay (there are 7 in our party, including a 3 year old) and were denied due to the delay being coded as weather related, which is absolutely bogus. So livid, frustrated, and tired at this point. Also found out AA has no number to call for complaints... You have to go through email so who knows if they will even read it or reply. Will never fly AA again if I can help it."
Tariq of Raleigh, NC," Jan. 31, 2016","I was on an almost 2 hour flight (Flight AA3936) stuck sitting with one leg over my bag and the other on the edge of the aisle. Not once was I asked to check in my bag nor told it wouldn't fit on the overhead bin. By the time we landed my knees, hips and back were killing me and I had to have help from the gentleman next to me to be able to stand up. So glad there wasn't an emergency 'cause this would have been one hell of a hazard. Lesson learned not to use this airline again."

Lijyun of Birmingham, MI," Jan. 13, 2016","I booked 2 separate flights on American Airlines in Economy since I pay for my air travel. On one they pre-assigned me a back-of-plane middle seat and said that I was required to pay some increased fee for window, aisle or closer to the front. On the second flight they said I have to wait until I reach the boarding gate for any seat. This is ridiculous and unacceptable. The airline has sufficient revenue to - just a suggestion - increase the ""base"" fare to cover a first-come-first-served seat selection and not put everyone into 3rd class or worse status. If they want to surcharge certain premium seats, like middle seats toward the front, that's OK, but this behavior is totally unacceptable and I refuse to fly them (or any airline) that abuses their passengers."
Chris of Prospect, KY," Jan. 13, 2016",Well I looked into changing my flight for my fiance and I to go home a day earlier... only to discover that American charges $200.00 a ticket PLUS the difference in price tickets! LIKE THAT IS GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE! So for the price of another ticket I can change my flight! I will be looking elsewhere for flights in the future. I have already paid for a flight and now you are trying to rip me off even more!?! Out of touch and terrible service to a customer of over 5 years. I will be going elsewhere where I don't get bent over the table. Thank you American!
Phil of Taylors, SC," Jan. 12, 2016","I originally booked my flight to Miami from Washington, DC back in July 2017. I was scheduled to fly September 13-18, 2017. I, like many, had to cancel my trip because of hurricane Irma. I was informed by two customer service representatives that I would be able to rebook my flight to Miami with no additional charges in fare and no change fees. Of course, when it comes time to book my flight, I'm informed about a change fee. I told the agent, I was reassured twice that I would not be charged any additional fees because my initial cancellation was weather related. "
Afonso of Davenport, FL," Jan. 12, 2016","American Airlines is full of **. Our cruise was cancelled due to Hurricane Irma. It was beyond our control and the airline stated there was nothing that they could do. No partial credit, changes or anything! I will not be flying with them anymore!"
Christy of Portland, OR," Jan. 12, 2016",My husband and I were scheduled to fly out at 7:15 am to go to California for a very important family matter. We do not live near the airport so we were up early to make sure we were early and nothing could go wrong. But things did go wrong. When we got to the airport we went and printed out tickets at the self checkout. We did notice that it mentioned no overhead storage for our carry on bags. So confused because we fly a lot and there is always overhead storage or they place in under the cabin. So we asked a lady that was standing in the area of self print and she looked and our tickets said we would be fine... Again we were told wrong.
Carol of Boston, MA," Jan. 10, 2016","On September 4 my family of 5 arrived at the airport in Anchorage to fly home to Toronto via Dallas. Four of us had carry-on sized luggage but one had a mid-sized suitcase that we knew we would have to check. Our flight to Toronto included a 12.5-hour connection at DFW (not by choice). Since none of us sleep well on planes, we were considering going to a hotel following the overnight flight to DFW. When checking the suitcase, I specifically asked the American Airlines agent ""if we only check this bag to DFW and then go to a hotel for a few hours of sleep, will we be charged a second baggage fee to check the bag in for the flight to Toronto? If so we can rearrange the bags so that we can just check it through to Toronto."" "

When I was getting ready to board in Charlotte, the attendant mentioned that this was a new program for your airline and that customers have stated it was cost effective. However, this was not my case! I paid nearly $600 to fly from Columbus, OH to Asheville, NC. Absolutely absurd!!! In the future, I will do all I can to avoid flying with your airline and don't count on a positive recommendation from me to others! Also, stop charging for the first piece of checked in luggage!"

I called at night again because I was worried I saw it was still cancel. After almost 2 hours they answered the phone. I told them what happened. They told me that they were very sorry but the flight was canceled and they didnt' have flight for Sept 12. They gave me 1 stop flight for Sept 13. "
Luiz of Miami Beach, FL," Jan. 8, 2016","I was scheduled to fly out of Tampa International on Sunday, September, 17th to Durango, CO. I live in Sarasota, and just returned home the other day after evacuating for Hurricane Irma. I fled Florida and headed to Georgia, where I had to rent a hotel for a few nights. When I returned home I was fortunate enough not to have suffered damage. I of course have yard debris strewn about and I am still without power. The power company has estimated by the end of the day on September 22nd I will have power. With the extra costs incurred from having to leave my home, and the loss of power, I decided this was not a good time to travel."
Aswath of Nyc, NY," Jan. 8, 2016","Hurricane Irma was mess for AA. I get it. I'm sure there were thousands who were stuck trying to get their flights changed. Unfortunately, I was in Costa Rica with a connection via Miami and I got, as the AA agent said ""the short end of the stick."" I would be stuck almost another week in Costa Rica as everything AA had was booked out or cancelled. I saw a little bit of silver lining when I found that if I could get to Mexico city, I could fly home via DFW. However, AA would not change the ticket as it is against their rules to change the country of origin on a ticket. ""We cannot do it."" However, a more accurate description is ""will not."""
Becky of Tulsa, OK," Jan. 7, 2016","We were delayed on our AA out of Seattle due to having to wait on flight crew. Managed to make it to Dallas on time BUT had to sit on the tarmac for 20 mins waiting for a gait in order to deplane. This caused to miss our connecting flight. Next available flight is the next day. Asked about compensation for overnight hotel stay (there are 7 in our party, including a 3 year old) and were denied due to the delay being coded as weather related, which is absolutely bogus. So livid, frustrated, and tired at this point. Also found out AA has no number to call for complaints... You have to go through email so who knows if they will even read it or reply. Will never fly AA again if I can help it."
Gerard of Royal Palm Beach, FL," Jan. 7, 2016","I was on an almost 2 hour flight (Flight AA3936) stuck sitting with one leg over my bag and the other on the edge of the aisle. Not once was I asked to check in my bag nor told it wouldn't fit on the overhead bin. By the time we landed my knees, hips and back were killing me and I had to have help from the gentleman next to me to be able to stand up. So glad there wasn't an emergency 'cause this would have been one hell of a hazard. Lesson learned not to use this airline again."
Maria of Panama City Beach , FL," Jan. 5, 2016","American Airlines‰Û_the new standard for horrible service. Oh‰Û_I mean HORRIBLE! I travel very frequently for work and have stuck to one specific airline in order to build my status with them (ie. first class upgrades often, better seat choices, free checked bags). Recently, service has taken a turn for the worse. I‰Ûªm a reasonable guy and tolerate more than most. Call it my Southern hospitality, my upbringing or my service to the community when I served in law enforcement, but I just plain put up with more‰Û_until now."
Siddhesh of Los Angeles, CA," Jan. 5, 2016","I travel 80%~ for Work and have flown with almost every airline multiple times. AA is by far the worst. Not due to their customer service/staff/delays or anything like that (at least that I‰Ûªve noticed), but their planes have no entertainment system on each seat, they do not play movies on the overhead screens, and they don‰Ûªt even have a free WiFi movie/tv option you can connect to using your phone! I‰Ûªm currently on a flight from Boston to Phoenix and was utterly shocked when I sat in my seat and noticed no form of entertainment for a cross-country flight. Delta and other airlines provide personal entertainment screens on each screen or a smartphone connect feature for 2+ hr flights, which in turn make the flights more enjoyable. Anyways, to avoid rambling on and on about the lack of technology on AA planes I‰Ûªll just say if you enjoyed traveling in the late 90s early 2000s, then AA is for you. If you want to travel in 2017 and beyond, find a different airline."
Donna Faith of Troutdale, OR," Jan. 5, 2016","I had a horrible experience today on my flight back to Miami. I have been an AAdvantage member for many years now and have always chosen to be loyal to American but after today's experience that may change. The onboarding process was fine and the flight was on time, which to be honest is rare but I was happy. When the snacks and beverage cart came the attendant did not smile, looked unhappy to take our beverage order, handed me and my husband 2 cookies, I then I told her, ""Can we just get pretzels?"" She said ""Then I need the cookies back."" I was honestly appalled."
MAUREEN of Buchanan, MI," Jan. 5, 2016","Don't deserve single star. Also, I have a flight from Chicago to Minneapolis 5 hours from now. And they have seats available on the earlier flight but won't give you without charging $75. They are ok to make you wait or fly a flight with empty seats but no customer delight which is no cost to them. No customer driven company and not looking for going extra mile to make customer happy. Never travel on American Airlines again."
kay of Aragon, GA," Jan. 5, 2016","Worst experience ever with AA never again, they treated my dad like garbage, they humiliated my dad in front of my niece travelling with him and in front of all passengers, just because my dad is ** and not fluent in English. I wish I could sue them for discrimination against my dad for not speaking English fluent instead of offering assistance in Spanish which, the sky harbor airport in Arizona has plenty of bilingual employees. DO NOT FLY AA EVER, pay more with a different airline. The only reason why my dad and niece flew AA to go to my brother's funeral, thank you AA for the worst day ever. It's a shame I have to put a star instead of no stars service."
Vance of Denver, CO," Jan. 4, 2016","This American Airlines review is out of frustration due to a lot of things. They're a disgrace! The employees are rude, there is no leg room, no entertainment, and treat people like herds of sheep. They have a ""New"" rule where they charge $50 at the gate to carry on your luggage. Are you kidding me? $50 for a carry on? And I can't even use the overhead bin! Disgraceful! Basically these guys are crooks! They're a disgrace. Last time I flew with American their flight was delayed by 2 hours and we ended up missing our connecting flight because it was the last flight out. We ended up having to stay an extra day and had to pay $100 for a hotel. We missed my sisters wedding. On the way back we ended up stuck on the tarmac for 2 hours. Of course!"
Joseph of Hallandale Beach, FL," Jan. 4, 2016","I booked a ticket back when the hurricane were hitting down south every other week. Because of that I was not able to attend my trip in GA. They told me I had up to a year to use my ticket. So when I try to rebook my ticket they are now close to $500. Mind you this is the highest rate out of all the airlines for my particular dates, I asked for a refund because I didn't wanna double what I paid the first time and I was told by the Supervisor (Willie ** in Dallas ) that my only option was to ""use it or lost it"". Being a supervisor myself I thought the tone in which he said it was very careless and he didn't try to help the situation at all. I would never talk to my customers the way he spoke to me especially after losing out on $300!!"
Kyle of Cambridge, MN," Jan. 4, 2016","I just completed a flight on American Airlines. I had read negative reviews, but I found the American Airlines people I had contact with were great, tried to provide all the service they could because our flight had been cancelled due WX and had to layover at ORD. My complaint is the phoney coupon given for a hotel room for a ""discounted rate"". The coupon has nothing to do with American Airlines, but is only a hotel booking service. When I called the phone number provided I was told the only available room was 10 miles away and given a rate of $80.00. It was getting late in the evening so took it. Then was advised there was a $15 service charge to book the room. American Airline paid none of this. The shuttle bus to the hotel was packed (Other delayed passengers). When I got home I checked the hotel rate and found the same room went for $105. I ""saved"" $10. The hotel was a Holiday Inn Express. Room not bad."
B of Baldwinsville, NY," Jan. 3, 2016","I was en route from San Antonio Texas to Hong Kong and when checking in for the domestic portion of the flight at the ticket counter, the woman claimed there was a problem with my passport. I asked for details and she claimed ""There are spots on your passport."" I told her the passport was still valid and did not expire until the following year."" She made up some baloney about Homeland Security not letting people fly with spots on their passport. I told her I checked their website and there was no mention of anything like that. She then claimed, ""Oh, they don't tell you."" I said, ""Then how are you supposed to know?"" She then sarcastically claimed I needed glasses, so I put my glasses on and told her those so called spots are not a problem. "

While I was away, I heard the news that my dad had passed away. In which, I contacted American Airlines right away and asked if anything can be done. I wanted to fly back before my actual trip date, due to obvious reasons. I even offered to provide them with a death certificate if need be (although, I don't think that is even something they should ask for right away). I spoke to 3 different customer service reps who were all horrible to speak with. They had zero compassion and empathy and just dismissed me as if what I was experiencing was far from a big deal to them. "
Sandra of Buford, GA," Jan. 1, 2016","I was on the plane for 14 hours due to a delay. Sitting in a broken seat that would not recline. I told the stewardess and she could care less, said nothing she can do. After I got home I contacted the airline and they issued me a fourteen dollar credit. I had paid 197.34 dollars for preferred seats. The worst flight of my life, never again w/ this airline."
Chris of Coupeville, WA," Jan. 1, 2016","Overall, (Un)American Airlines continues to disappoint. I really only ever fly with AA as a last resort, and I can't see any reason to recommend traveling with AA. I was prior active duty Army, and now I'm a reservist, and only American Airlines makes me feel like my service is less important now. United, Southwest, Jet Blue, Delta, every other airline doesn't discriminate between Active Duty and Reserve/Guardsmen when it comes to bag fees. So, along with uncomfortable, outdated planes and poor service, I spent a $100 checking bags to and from my destination."
cautious of Harrisburg, PA," Dec. 31, 2015",American Airlines is the worst airlines to fly anywhere. They cram you in the seats with no leg room or any room for that matter. I requested a wheelchair at airport and waited 30 minutes upon someone finally arriving. They took me the wrong way to my next check in and I missed my flight. They said I would have to rebook my ticket and just wait for the next flight. Attendant at the gate was very disrespectful and not helpful at all. I had no control over this situation at all. Not to mention when I did finally arrive at my destination that I requested a wheelchair prior to my departure.
Lisa of Snohomish, WA," Dec. 31, 2015","American Airlines is the worst airline in THE WORLD, and should change their name, it is utterly disgraceful that as an American they use this name. Their policy is to not apologize for anything, to be as rude as possible to people who are basically held hostage to them and their BS policies like closing the door to the gate while people are standing there then charging them money to rebook their flight, not caring at all about the bags on their way to a destination without the owners there to pick them up. Then being told when lodging a complaint that it was going in one ear and out the other. I have never been treated so poorly in my life, I will never again fly with this airline, I hope they go bankrupt and get the worst karma life can give. Oh yeah and I get to fly with them tomorrow. :/"
laurie of Dubuque, IA," Dec. 31, 2015","Very disappointed. Unlikely I will ever choose American Airlines again. I didn't make my flight in the spring. I was given a voucher to use for future travel. Now I'm being told I can only use it myself, and not for my family. I don't want to use it for myself. What difference does it make? I'm being told different things by different people. The last guy hung up on me and I wasn't even rude to him. This is how AA does business? All I want is to not be penalized for cancelling a flight that was beyond my control. If you have a voucher it should be flexible to use for anyone. AA is the WORST! Hope they go out of business for this nonsense. Airline travel is a joke."
Chris of Lynn, MA," Dec. 31, 2015","American Airlines canceled my 92-year-old father-in-law's flight to Key West due to Hurricane Irma. On that day American Airline was contacted and the representative said there would be no problem re-booking, just use the reference number. American Airlines even went on TV and said they would waive re-booking fees. Today when calling to re-book the flight and after 57 minutes on the phone, I was told the flight could not be re-booked because it was in their notes I requested a refund. At no time did I request a refund and American Airlines could not locate any record of a refund request. Even so, American Airlines still insisted they could not re-book the flight or issue a refund. If we did not have enough trouble dealing with a Cat 4 hurricane and its devastating aftermath, now American Airlines is adding to the misery. All my father-in-law wants is to come to Key West and see that everyone is alright. Thanks, AA."

Stefan of Greenville, NC," Dec. 26, 2015","I booked a ticket back when the hurricane were hitting down south every other week. Because of that I was not able to attend my trip in GA. They told me I had up to a year to use my ticket. So when I try to rebook my ticket they are now close to $500. Mind you this is the highest rate out of all the airlines for my particular dates, I asked for a refund because I didn't wanna double what I paid the first time and I was told by the Supervisor (Willie ** in Dallas ) that my only option was to ""use it or lost it"". Being a supervisor myself I thought the tone in which he said it was very careless and he didn't try to help the situation at all. I would never talk to my customers the way he spoke to me especially after losing out on $300!!"
Cheryl of Deptford, NJ," Dec. 25, 2015","I just completed a flight on American Airlines. I had read negative reviews, but I found the American Airlines people I had contact with were great, tried to provide all the service they could because our flight had been cancelled due WX and had to layover at ORD. My complaint is the phoney coupon given for a hotel room for a ""discounted rate"". The coupon has nothing to do with American Airlines, but is only a hotel booking service. When I called the phone number provided I was told the only available room was 10 miles away and given a rate of $80.00. It was getting late in the evening so took it. Then was advised there was a $15 service charge to book the room. American Airline paid none of this. The shuttle bus to the hotel was packed (Other delayed passengers). When I got home I checked the hotel rate and found the same room went for $105. I ""saved"" $10. The hotel was a Holiday Inn Express. Room not bad."

She made up some baloney about Homeland Security not letting people fly with spots on their passport. I told her I checked their website and there was no mention of anything like that.

Judy of West Covina, CA," Dec. 23, 2015","Overall, (Un)American Airlines continues to disappoint.

United, Southwest, Jet Blue, Delta, every other airline doesn't discriminate between Active Duty and Reserve/Guardsmen when it comes to bag fees. So, along with uncomfortable, outdated planes and poor service, I spent a $100 checking bags to and from my destination."
David of Livingston, CA," Dec. 23, 2015",American Airlines is the worst airlines to fly anywhere. They cram you in the seats with no leg room or any room for that matter.

They said I would have to rebook my ticket and just wait for the next flight. Attendant at the gate was very disrespectful and not helpful at all. I had no control over this situation at all. Not to mention when I did finally arrive at my destination that I requested a wheelchair prior to my departure.

Then being told when lodging a complaint that it was going in one ear and out the other. I have never been treated so poorly in my life, I will never again fly with this airline, I hope they go bankrupt and get the worst karma life can give. Oh yeah and I get to fly with them tomorrow. :/"
Terry of Phoenix, AZ," Dec. 21, 2015","Very disappointed. Unlikely I will ever choose American Airlines again. I didn't make my flight in the spring. I was given a voucher to use for future travel. Now I'm being told I can only use it myself, and not for my family. I don't want to use it for myself. What difference does it make? I'm being told different things by different people. The last guy hung up on me and I wasn't even rude to him. This is how AA does business? All I want is to not be penalized for cancelling a flight that was beyond my control. If you have a voucher it should be flexible to use for anyone. AA is the WORST! Hope they go out of business for this nonsense. Airline travel is a joke."
tina of Fernley, NV," Dec. 21, 2015","American Airlines canceled my 92-year-old father-in-law's flight to Key West due to Hurricane Irma. On that day American Airline was contacted and the representative said there would be no problem re-booking, just use the reference number. American Airlines even went on TV and said they would waive re-booking fees. Today when calling to re-book the flight and after 57 minutes on the phone, I was told the flight could not be re-booked because it was in their notes I requested a refund. At no time did I request a refund and American Airlines could not locate any record of a refund request. Even so, American Airlines still insisted they could not re-book the flight or issue a refund. If we did not have enough trouble dealing with a Cat 4 hurricane and its devastating aftermath, now American Airlines is adding to the misery. All my father-in-law wants is to come to Key West and see that everyone is alright. Thanks, AA."
Lindsay of Glen Iris, Australia," Dec. 21, 2015",I bought tickets for my mother in law and son to meet my wife and I in Colorado. We had traveled on different airlines due to connections and therefore were going back on different airlines. My wife and I left on our airplane. My mother in law and son were stranded as the plane had a mechanical. This was 8 AM and the bottom line was it didn't get fixed that day. American gave them a 12.00 voucher good in the terminal and did nothing to get them a room as the rooms they usually used weren't available.
Bobbi of Summerville, SC," Dec. 20, 2015","I booked 2 separate flights on American Airlines in Economy since I pay for my air travel. On one they pre-assigned me a back-of-plane middle seat and said that I was required to pay some increased fee for window, aisle or closer to the front. On the second flight they said I have to wait until I reach the boarding gate for any seat. This is ridiculous and unacceptable. The airline has sufficient revenue to - just a suggestion - increase the ""base"" fare to cover a first-come-first-served seat selection and not put everyone into 3rd class or worse status. If they want to surcharge certain premium seats, like middle seats toward the front, that's OK, but this behavior is totally unacceptable and I refuse to fly them (or any airline) that abuses their passengers."
Ali of Leominster, MA," Dec. 18, 2015",Well I looked into changing my flight for my fiance and I to go home a day earlier... only to discover that American charges $200.00 a ticket PLUS the difference in price tickets! LIKE THAT IS GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE! So for the price of another ticket I can change my flight! I will be looking elsewhere for flights in the future. I have already paid for a flight and now you are trying to rip me off even more!?! Out of touch and terrible service to a customer of over 5 years. I will be going elsewhere where I don't get bent over the table. Thank you American!

I was informed by two customer service representatives that I would be able to rebook my flight to Miami with no additional charges in fare and no change fees. Of course, when it comes time to book my flight, I'm informed about a change fee. I told the agent, I was reassured twice that I would not be charged any additional fees because my initial cancellation was weather related. "
Rick of Palm Beach , FL," Dec. 17, 2015","American Airlines is full of **. Our cruise was cancelled due to Hurricane Irma. It was beyond our control and the airline stated there was nothing that they could do. No partial credit, changes or anything! I will not be flying with them anymore!"
Tyesha of Fort Riley, KS," Dec. 16, 2015",My husband and I were scheduled to fly out at 7:15 am to go to California for a very important family matter. We do not live near the airport so we were up early to make sure we were early and nothing could go wrong. But things did go wrong. When we got to the airport we went and printed out tickets at the self checkout. We did notice that it mentioned no overhead storage for our carry on bags. So confused because we fly a lot and there is always overhead storage or they place in under the cabin. So we asked a lady that was standing in the area of self print and she looked and our tickets said we would be fine... Again we were told wrong.
Vanessa of Portland, OR," Dec. 15, 2015","On September 4 my family of 5 arrived at the airport in Anchorage to fly home to Toronto via Dallas. Four of us had carry-on sized luggage but one had a mid-sized suitcase that we knew we would have to check. Our flight to Toronto included a 12.5-hour connection at DFW (not by choice). Since none of us sleep well on planes, we were considering going to a hotel following the overnight flight to DFW. When checking the suitcase, I specifically asked the American Airlines agent ""if we only check this bag to DFW and then go to a hotel for a few hours of sleep, will we be charged a second baggage fee to check the bag in for the flight to Toronto? If so we can rearrange the bags so that we can just check it through to Toronto."" "
Julia of Stevensville, ON," Dec. 14, 2015","I purchased the basic economy ticket. When I was getting ready to board in Charlotte, the attendant mentioned that this was a new program for your airline and that customers have stated it was cost effective. However, this was not my case! I paid nearly $600 to fly from Columbus, OH to Asheville, NC. Absolutely absurd!!! In the future, I will do all I can to avoid flying with your airline and don't count on a positive recommendation from me to others! Also, stop charging for the first piece of checked in luggage!"

I called at night again because I was worried I saw it was still cancel. After almost 2 hours they answered the phone. I told them what happened. They told me that they were very sorry but the flight was canceled and they didnt' have flight for Sept 12. They gave me 1 stop flight for Sept 13. "
Jaasel of North Miami Beach , FL," Dec. 10, 2015","I was scheduled to fly out of Tampa International on Sunday, September, 17th to Durango, CO. I live in Sarasota, and just returned home the other day after evacuating for Hurricane Irma. I fled Florida and headed to Georgia, where I had to rent a hotel for a few nights. When I returned home I was fortunate enough not to have suffered damage. I of course have yard debris strewn about and I am still without power. The power company has estimated by the end of the day on September 22nd I will have power. With the extra costs incurred from having to leave my home, and the loss of power, I decided this was not a good time to travel."
Alex of Nowhere, GA," Dec. 4, 2015","Hurricane Irma was mess for AA. I get it. I'm sure there were thousands who were stuck trying to get their flights changed. Unfortunately, I was in Costa Rica with a connection via Miami and I got, as the AA agent said ""the short end of the stick."" I would be stuck almost another week in Costa Rica as everything AA had was booked out or cancelled. I saw a little bit of silver lining when I found that if I could get to Mexico city, I could fly home via DFW. However, AA would not change the ticket as it is against their rules to change the country of origin on a ticket. ""We cannot do it."" However, a more accurate description is ""will not."""
Luz of Guayanilla, Other," Dec. 4, 2015","We were delayed on our AA out of Seattle due to having to wait on flight crew. Managed to make it to Dallas on time BUT had to sit on the tarmac for 20 mins waiting for a gait in order to deplane. This caused to miss our connecting flight. Next available flight is the next day. Asked about compensation for overnight hotel stay (there are 7 in our party, including a 3 year old) and were denied due to the delay being coded as weather related, which is absolutely bogus. So livid, frustrated, and tired at this point. Also found out AA has no number to call for complaints... You have to go through email so who knows if they will even read it or reply. Will never fly AA again if I can help it."
Terry of Lakewood Ranch, FL," Dec. 3, 2015","I was on an almost 2 hour flight (Flight AA3936) stuck sitting with one leg over my bag and the other on the edge of the aisle. Not once was I asked to check in my bag nor told it wouldn't fit on the overhead bin. By the time we landed my knees, hips and back were killing me and I had to have help from the gentleman next to me to be able to stand up. So glad there wasn't an emergency 'cause this would have been one hell of a hazard. Lesson learned not to use this airline again."
Richard of Wirral, Other," Dec. 3, 2015","American Airlines‰Û_the new standard for horrible service. Oh‰Û_I mean HORRIBLE! I travel very frequently for work and have stuck to one specific airline in order to build my status with them (ie. first class upgrades often, better seat choices, free checked bags). Recently, service has taken a turn for the worse. I‰Ûªm a reasonable guy and tolerate more than most. Call it my Southern hospitality, my upbringing or my service to the community when I served in law enforcement, but I just plain put up with more‰Û_until now."
EDWIN of Leland, NC," Dec. 3, 2015","I travel 80%~ for Work and have flown with almost every airline multiple times. AA is by far the worst. Not due to their customer service/staff/delays or anything like that (at least that I‰Ûªve noticed), but their planes have no entertainment system on each seat, they do not play movies on the overhead screens, and they don‰Ûªt even have a free WiFi movie/tv option you can connect to using your phone! I‰Ûªm currently on a flight from Boston to Phoenix and was utterly shocked when I sat in my seat and noticed no form of entertainment for a cross-country flight. Delta and other airlines provide personal entertainment screens on each screen or a smartphone connect feature for 2+ hr flights, which in turn make the flights more enjoyable. Anyways, to avoid rambling on and on about the lack of technology on AA planes I‰Ûªll just say if you enjoyed traveling in the late 90s early 2000s, then AA is for you. If you want to travel in 2017 and beyond, find a different airline."
Randall of Chanute, KS," Dec. 3, 2015","I had a horrible experience today on my flight back to Miami. I have been an AAdvantage member for many years now and have always chosen to be loyal to American but after today's experience that may change. The onboarding process was fine and the flight was on time, which to be honest is rare but I was happy. When the snacks and beverage cart came the attendant did not smile, looked unhappy to take our beverage order, handed me and my husband 2 cookies, I then I told her, ""Can we just get pretzels?"" She said ""Then I need the cookies back."" I was honestly appalled."
Javi of Cuauhtemoc, Other," Dec. 2, 2015","Don't deserve single star. Also, I have a flight from Chicago to Minneapolis 5 hours from now. And they have seats available on the earlier flight but won't give you without charging $75. They are ok to make you wait or fly a flight with empty seats but no customer delight which is no cost to them. No customer driven company and not looking for going extra mile to make customer happy. Never travel on American Airlines again."
Afton of Big Bear City, CA," Dec. 1, 2015","Worst experience ever with AA never again, they treated my dad like garbage, they humiliated my dad in front of my niece travelling with him and in front of all passengers, just because my dad is ** and not fluent in English. I wish I could sue them for discrimination against my dad for not speaking English fluent instead of offering assistance in Spanish which, the sky harbor airport in Arizona has plenty of bilingual employees. DO NOT FLY AA EVER, pay more with a different airline. The only reason why my dad and niece flew AA to go to my brother's funeral, thank you AA for the worst day ever. It's a shame I have to put a star instead of no stars service."
Jackie of Danville, VA," Dec. 1, 2015","This American Airlines review is out of frustration due to a lot of things. They're a disgrace!

Are you kidding me? $50 for a carry on? And I can't even use the overhead bin! Disgraceful! Basically these guys are crooks! They're a disgrace. Last time I flew with American their flight was delayed by 2 hours and we ended up missing our connecting flight because it was the last flight out.

Since none of us sleep well on planes, we were considering going to a hotel following the overnight flight to DFW. When checking the suitcase, I specifically asked the American Airlines agent ""if we only check this bag to DFW and then go to a hotel for a few hours of sleep, will we be charged a second baggage fee to check the bag in for the flight to Toronto? If so we can rearrange the bags so that we can just check it through to Toronto."" "
Dana of North Bellmore, NY," Nov. 19, 2015","I purchased the basic economy ticket. When I was getting ready to board in Charlotte, the attendant mentioned that this was a new program for your airline and that customers have stated it was cost effective. However, this was not my case! I paid nearly $600 to fly from Columbus, OH to Asheville, NC. Absolutely absurd!!! In the future, I will do all I can to avoid flying with your airline and don't count on a positive recommendation from me to others! Also, stop charging for the first piece of checked in luggage!"

September 11 I checked the flight online and it was canceled. I called customer service. Patricia told me that I was wrong it wasn't cancel. I called at night again because I was worried I saw it was still cancel. After almost 2 hours they answered the phone. I told them what happened. They told me that they were very sorry but the flight was canceled and they didnt' have flight for Sept 12. They gave me 1 stop flight for Sept 13. "
Diane of Vidor, TX," Nov. 18, 2015","I was scheduled to fly out of Tampa International on Sunday, September, 17th to Durango, CO. I live in Sarasota, and just returned home the other day after evacuating for Hurricane Irma. I fled Florida and headed to Georgia, where I had to rent a hotel for a few nights. When I returned home I was fortunate enough not to have suffered damage. I of course have yard debris strewn about and I am still without power. The power company has estimated by the end of the day on September 22nd I will have power. With the extra costs incurred from having to leave my home, and the loss of power, I decided this was not a good time to travel."
Seda of Istanbul, Other," Nov. 17, 2015","Hurricane Irma was mess for AA. I get it. I'm sure there were thousands who were stuck trying to get their flights changed. Unfortunately, I was in Costa Rica with a connection via Miami and I got, as the AA agent said ""the short end of the stick."" I would be stuck almost another week in Costa Rica as everything AA had was booked out or cancelled. I saw a little bit of silver lining when I found that if I could get to Mexico city, I could fly home via DFW. However, AA would not change the ticket as it is against their rules to change the country of origin on a ticket. ""We cannot do it."" However, a more accurate description is ""will not."""
Magda of Ponce, Other," Nov. 16, 2015","We were delayed on our AA out of Seattle due to having to wait on flight crew. Managed to make it to Dallas on time BUT had to sit on the tarmac for 20 mins waiting for a gait in order to deplane. This caused to miss our connecting flight. Next available flight is the next day. Asked about compensation for overnight hotel stay (there are 7 in our party, including a 3 year old) and were denied due to the delay being coded as weather related, which is absolutely bogus. So livid, frustrated, and tired at this point. Also found out AA has no number to call for complaints... You have to go through email so who knows if they will even read it or reply. Will never fly AA again if I can help it."
Chris of New York, NY," Nov. 15, 2015","I was on an almost 2 hour flight (Flight AA3936) stuck sitting with one leg over my bag and the other on the edge of the aisle. Not once was I asked to check in my bag nor told it wouldn't fit on the overhead bin. By the time we landed my knees, hips and back were killing me and I had to have help from the gentleman next to me to be able to stand up. So glad there wasn't an emergency 'cause this would have been one hell of a hazard. Lesson learned not to use this airline again."
Vernon of Raleigh, NC," Nov. 13, 2015","American Airlines‰Û_the new standard for horrible service. Oh‰Û_I mean HORRIBLE! I travel very frequently for work and have stuck to one specific airline in order to build my status with them (ie. first class upgrades often, better seat choices, free checked bags). Recently, service has taken a turn for the worse. I‰Ûªm a reasonable guy and tolerate more than most. Call it my Southern hospitality, my upbringing or my service to the community when I served in law enforcement, but I just plain put up with more‰Û_until now."
Dan of Elk River, MN," Nov. 13, 2015","I travel 80%~ for Work and have flown with almost every airline multiple times. AA is by far the worst. Not due to their customer service/staff/delays or anything like that (at least that I‰Ûªve noticed), but their planes have no entertainment system on each seat, they do not play movies on the overhead screens, and they don‰Ûªt even have a free WiFi movie/tv option you can connect to using your phone! I‰Ûªm currently on a flight from Boston to Phoenix and was utterly shocked when I sat in my seat and noticed no form of entertainment for a cross-country flight. Delta and other airlines provide personal entertainment screens on each screen or a smartphone connect feature for 2+ hr flights, which in turn make the flights more enjoyable. Anyways, to avoid rambling on and on about the lack of technology on AA planes I‰Ûªll just say if you enjoyed traveling in the late 90s early 2000s, then AA is for you. If you want to travel in 2017 and beyond, find a different airline."
Dena of Princeton, NJ," Nov. 13, 2015","I had a horrible experience today on my flight back to Miami. I have been an AAdvantage member for many years now and have always chosen to be loyal to American but after today's experience that may change. The onboarding process was fine and the flight was on time, which to be honest is rare but I was happy. When the snacks and beverage cart came the attendant did not smile, looked unhappy to take our beverage order, handed me and my husband 2 cookies, I then I told her, ""Can we just get pretzels?"" She said ""Then I need the cookies back."" I was honestly appalled."
Jared of Augusta, GA," Nov. 12, 2015","Don't deserve single star. Also, I have a flight from Chicago to Minneapolis 5 hours from now. And they have seats available on the earlier flight but won't give you without charging $75. They are ok to make you wait or fly a flight with empty seats but no customer delight which is no cost to them. No customer driven company and not looking for going extra mile to make customer happy. Never travel on American Airlines again."
Pat of El Centro, CA," Nov. 12, 2015","Worst experience ever with AA never again, they treated my dad like garbage, they humiliated my dad in front of my niece travelling with him and in front of all passengers, just because my dad is ** and not fluent in English. I wish I could sue them for discrimination against my dad for not speaking English fluent instead of offering assistance in Spanish which, the sky harbor airport in Arizona has plenty of bilingual employees. DO NOT FLY AA EVER, pay more with a different airline. The only reason why my dad and niece flew AA to go to my brother's funeral, thank you AA for the worst day ever. It's a shame I have to put a star instead of no stars service."
Fay of Chicago, IL," Nov. 12, 2015","This American Airlines review is out of frustration due to a lot of things. They're a disgrace! The employees are rude, there is no leg room, no entertainment, and treat people like herds of sheep. They have a ""New"" rule where they charge $50 at the gate to carry on your luggage. Are you kidding me? $50 for a carry on? And I can't even use the overhead bin! Disgraceful! Basically these guys are crooks! They're a disgrace. Last time I flew with American their flight was delayed by 2 hours and we ended up missing our connecting flight because it was the last flight out. We ended up having to stay an extra day and had to pay $100 for a hotel. We missed my sisters wedding. On the way back we ended up stuck on the tarmac for 2 hours. Of course!"
Anna of Hastings, Other," Nov. 11, 2015","I booked a ticket back when the hurricane were hitting down south every other week. Because of that I was not able to attend my trip in GA. They told me I had up to a year to use my ticket. So when I try to rebook my ticket they are now close to $500. Mind you this is the highest rate out of all the airlines for my particular dates, I asked for a refund because I didn't wanna double what I paid the first time and I was told by the Supervisor (Willie ** in Dallas ) that my only option was to ""use it or lost it"". Being a supervisor myself I thought the tone in which he said it was very careless and he didn't try to help the situation at all. I would never talk to my customers the way he spoke to me especially after losing out on $300!!"
Beth of Tacoma, WA," Nov. 10, 2015","I just completed a flight on American Airlines. I had read negative reviews, but I found the American Airlines people I had contact with were great, tried to provide all the service they could because our flight had been cancelled due WX and had to layover at ORD. My complaint is the phoney coupon given for a hotel room for a ""discounted rate"". The coupon has nothing to do with American Airlines, but is only a hotel booking service. When I called the phone number provided I was told the only available room was 10 miles away and given a rate of $80.00. It was getting late in the evening so took it. Then was advised there was a $15 service charge to book the room. American Airline paid none of this. The shuttle bus to the hotel was packed (Other delayed passengers). When I got home I checked the hotel rate and found the same room went for $105. I ""saved"" $10. The hotel was a Holiday Inn Express. Room not bad."

She made up some baloney about Homeland Security not letting people fly with spots on their passport. I told her I checked their website and there was no mention of anything like that. She then claimed, ""Oh, they don't tell you."" I said, ""Then how are you supposed to know?""

While I was away, I heard the news that my dad had passed away. In which, I contacted American Airlines right away and asked if anything can be done. I wanted to fly back before my actual trip date, due to obvious reasons. I even offered to provide them with a death certificate if need be (although, I don't think that is even something they should ask for right away). I spoke to 3 different customer service reps who were all horrible to speak with. They had zero compassion and empathy and just dismissed me as if what I was experiencing was far from a big deal to them. "
Adam  of Rio Rancho, NM," Nov. 9, 2015","I was on the plane for 14 hours due to a delay. Sitting in a broken seat that would not recline. I told the stewardess and she could care less, said nothing she can do. After I got home I contacted the airline and they issued me a fourteen dollar credit. I had paid 197.34 dollars for preferred seats. The worst flight of my life, never again w/ this airline."
Kimberly of Covington, GA," Nov. 8, 2015","Overall, (Un)American Airlines continues to disappoint. I really only ever fly with AA as a last resort, and I can't see any reason to recommend traveling with AA. I was prior active duty Army, and now I'm a reservist, and only American Airlines makes me feel like my service is less important now. United, Southwest, Jet Blue, Delta, every other airline doesn't discriminate between Active Duty and Reserve/Guardsmen when it comes to bag fees. So, along with uncomfortable, outdated planes and poor service, I spent a $100 checking bags to and from my destination."
Elaine of La Plata, MD," Nov. 8, 2015",American Airlines is the worst airlines to fly anywhere. They cram you in the seats with no leg room or any room for that matter. I requested a wheelchair at airport and waited 30 minutes upon someone finally arriving. They took me the wrong way to my next check in and I missed my flight. They said I would have to rebook my ticket and just wait for the next flight. Attendant at the gate was very disrespectful and not helpful at all. I had no control over this situation at all. Not to mention when I did finally arrive at my destination that I requested a wheelchair prior to my departure.
Rash of Houston, TX," Nov. 7, 2015","American Airlines is the worst airline in THE WORLD, and should change their name, it is utterly disgraceful that as an American they use this name. Their policy is to not apologize for anything, to be as rude as possible to people who are basically held hostage to them and their BS policies like closing the door to the gate while people are standing there then charging them money to rebook their flight, not caring at all about the bags on their way to a destination without the owners there to pick them up. Then being told when lodging a complaint that it was going in one ear and out the other. I have never been treated so poorly in my life, I will never again fly with this airline, I hope they go bankrupt and get the worst karma life can give. Oh yeah and I get to fly with them tomorrow. :/"
Sam of Henrico, VA," Nov. 6, 2015","Very disappointed. Unlikely I will ever choose American Airlines again. I didn't make my flight in the spring. I was given a voucher to use for future travel. Now I'm being told I can only use it myself, and not for my family. I don't want to use it for myself. What difference does it make? I'm being told different things by different people. The last guy hung up on me and I wasn't even rude to him. This is how AA does business? All I want is to not be penalized for cancelling a flight that was beyond my control. If you have a voucher it should be flexible to use for anyone. AA is the WORST! Hope they go out of business for this nonsense. Airline travel is a joke."
Indeepa of Naperville, IL," Nov. 5, 2015","American Airlines canceled my 92-year-old father-in-law's flight to Key West due to Hurricane Irma. On that day American Airline was contacted and the representative said there would be no problem re-booking, just use the reference number. American Airlines even went on TV and said they would waive re-booking fees. Today when calling to re-book the flight and after 57 minutes on the phone, I was told the flight could not be re-booked because it was in their notes I requested a refund. At no time did I request a refund and American Airlines could not locate any record of a refund request. Even so, American Airlines still insisted they could not re-book the flight or issue a refund. If we did not have enough trouble dealing with a Cat 4 hurricane and its devastating aftermath, now American Airlines is adding to the misery. All my father-in-law wants is to come to Key West and see that everyone is alright. Thanks, AA."
Mark of Franklin, WI," Nov. 4, 2015",I bought tickets for my mother in law and son to meet my wife and I in Colorado. We had traveled on different airlines due to connections and therefore were going back on different airlines. My wife and I left on our airplane. My mother in law and son were stranded as the plane had a mechanical. This was 8 AM and the bottom line was it didn't get fixed that day. American gave them a 12.00 voucher good in the terminal and did nothing to get them a room as the rooms they usually used weren't available.
Leanne of Atlanta, GA," Nov. 4, 2015","I booked 2 separate flights on American Airlines in Economy since I pay for my air travel. On one they pre-assigned me a back-of-plane middle seat and said that I was required to pay some increased fee for window, aisle or closer to the front. On the second flight they said I have to wait until I reach the boarding gate for any seat. This is ridiculous and unacceptable. The airline has sufficient revenue to - just a suggestion - increase the ""base"" fare to cover a first-come-first-served seat selection and not put everyone into 3rd class or worse status. If they want to surcharge certain premium seats, like middle seats toward the front, that's OK, but this behavior is totally unacceptable and I refuse to fly them (or any airline) that abuses their passengers."
Liz of Philadelphia, PA," Nov. 4, 2015",Well I looked into changing my flight for my fiance and I to go home a day earlier... only to discover that American charges $200.00 a ticket PLUS the difference in price tickets! LIKE THAT IS GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE! So for the price of another ticket I can change my flight! I will be looking elsewhere for flights in the future. I have already paid for a flight and now you are trying to rip me off even more!?! Out of touch and terrible service to a customer of over 5 years. I will be going elsewhere where I don't get bent over the table. Thank you American!

Of course, when it comes time to book my flight, I'm informed about a change fee.

Anne of Edinburgh, Other," Nov. 3, 2015",My husband and I were scheduled to fly out at 7:15 am to go to California for a very important family matter. We do not live near the airport so we were up early to make sure we were early and nothing could go wrong. But things did go wrong. When we got to the airport we went and printed out tickets at the self checkout. We did notice that it mentioned no overhead storage for our carry on bags. So confused because we fly a lot and there is always overhead storage or they place in under the cabin. So we asked a lady that was standing in the area of self print and she looked and our tickets said we would be fine... Again we were told wrong.

I wanted to fly back before my actual trip date, due to obvious reasons. I even offered to provide them with a death certificate if need be (although, I don't think that is even something they should ask for right away). I spoke to 3 different customer service reps who were all horrible to speak with. They had zero compassion and empathy and just dismissed me as if what I was experiencing was far from a big deal to them. "
Rhonda of Vista, CA," Oct. 24, 2015","I was on the plane for 14 hours due to a delay. Sitting in a broken seat that would not recline. I told the stewardess and she could care less, said nothing she can do. After I got home I contacted the airline and they issued me a fourteen dollar credit. I had paid 197.34 dollars for preferred seats. The worst flight of my life, never again w/ this airline."
Jane of Bedford, NH," Oct. 24, 2015","Overall, (Un)American Airlines continues to disappoint. I really only ever fly with AA as a last resort, and I can't see any reason to recommend traveling with AA. I was prior active duty Army, and now I'm a reservist, and only American Airlines makes me feel like my service is less important now. United, Southwest, Jet Blue, Delta, every other airline doesn't discriminate between Active Duty and Reserve/Guardsmen when it comes to bag fees. So, along with uncomfortable, outdated planes and poor service, I spent a $100 checking bags to and from my destination."
Stan of None, CA," Oct. 24, 2015",American Airlines is the worst airlines to fly anywhere. They cram you in the seats with no leg room or any room for that matter. I requested a wheelchair at airport and waited 30 minutes upon someone finally arriving. They took me the wrong way to my next check in and I missed my flight. They said I would have to rebook my ticket and just wait for the next flight. Attendant at the gate was very disrespectful and not helpful at all. I had no control over this situation at all. Not to mention when I did finally arrive at my destination that I requested a wheelchair prior to my departure.
Stacy of Cape Coral , FL," Oct. 23, 2015","American Airlines is the worst airline in THE WORLD, and should change their name, it is utterly disgraceful that as an American they use this name. Their policy is to not apologize for anything, to be as rude as possible to people who are basically held hostage to them and their BS policies like closing the door to the gate while people are standing there then charging them money to rebook their flight, not caring at all about the bags on their way to a destination without the owners there to pick them up. Then being told when lodging a complaint that it was going in one ear and out the other. I have never been treated so poorly in my life, I will never again fly with this airline, I hope they go bankrupt and get the worst karma life can give. Oh yeah and I get to fly with them tomorrow. :/"
Lisa of Folsom, CA," Oct. 22, 2015","Very disappointed. Unlikely I will ever choose American Airlines again. I didn't make my flight in the spring. I was given a voucher to use for future travel. Now I'm being told I can only use it myself, and not for my family. I don't want to use it for myself. What difference does it make? I'm being told different things by different people. The last guy hung up on me and I wasn't even rude to him. This is how AA does business? All I want is to not be penalized for cancelling a flight that was beyond my control. If you have a voucher it should be flexible to use for anyone. AA is the WORST! Hope they go out of business for this nonsense. Airline travel is a joke."
Cynthia of San Antonio, TX," Oct. 22, 2015","American Airlines canceled my 92-year-old father-in-law's flight to Key West due to Hurricane Irma. On that day American Airline was contacted and the representative said there would be no problem re-booking, just use the reference number. American Airlines even went on TV and said they would waive re-booking fees. Today when calling to re-book the flight and after 57 minutes on the phone, I was told the flight could not be re-booked because it was in their notes I requested a refund. At no time did I request a refund and American Airlines could not locate any record of a refund request. Even so, American Airlines still insisted they could not re-book the flight or issue a refund. If we did not have enough trouble dealing with a Cat 4 hurricane and its devastating aftermath, now American Airlines is adding to the misery. All my father-in-law wants is to come to Key West and see that everyone is alright. Thanks, AA."
Dror of Holiday, FL," Oct. 21, 2015",I bought tickets for my mother in law and son to meet my wife and I in Colorado. We had traveled on different airlines due to connections and therefore were going back on different airlines. My wife and I left on our airplane. My mother in law and son were stranded as the plane had a mechanical. This was 8 AM and the bottom line was it didn't get fixed that day. American gave them a 12.00 voucher good in the terminal and did nothing to get them a room as the rooms they usually used weren't available.
Khalid of Rochdale, Other," Oct. 21, 2015","I booked 2 separate flights on American Airlines in Economy since I pay for my air travel. On one they pre-assigned me a back-of-plane middle seat and said that I was required to pay some increased fee for window, aisle or closer to the front. On the second flight they said I have to wait until I reach the boarding gate for any seat. This is ridiculous and unacceptable. The airline has sufficient revenue to - just a suggestion - increase the ""base"" fare to cover a first-come-first-served seat selection and not put everyone into 3rd class or worse status. If they want to surcharge certain premium seats, like middle seats toward the front, that's OK, but this behavior is totally unacceptable and I refuse to fly them (or any airline) that abuses their passengers."
Deb of #B-573, CO," Oct. 20, 2015",Well I looked into changing my flight for my fiance and I to go home a day earlier... only to discover that American charges $200.00 a ticket PLUS the difference in price tickets! LIKE THAT IS GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE! So for the price of another ticket I can change my flight! I will be looking elsewhere for flights in the future. I have already paid for a flight and now you are trying to rip me off even more!?! Out of touch and terrible service to a customer of over 5 years. I will be going elsewhere where I don't get bent over the table. Thank you American!
Nancy of Brisbane, Other," Oct. 20, 2015","I originally booked my flight to Miami from Washington, DC back in July 2017. I was scheduled to fly September 13-18, 2017.

I was informed by two customer service representatives that I would be able to rebook my flight to Miami with no additional charges in fare and no change fees. Of course, when it comes time to book my flight, I'm informed about a change fee. I told the agent, I was reassured twice that I would not be charged any additional fees because my initial cancellation was weather related. "
Jenny of Monroe, NY," Oct. 19, 2015","American Airlines is full of **. Our cruise was cancelled due to Hurricane Irma. It was beyond our control and the airline stated there was nothing that they could do. No partial credit, changes or anything! I will not be flying with them anymore!"
Angelo of Ft Lauderdale, FL," Oct. 19, 2015",My husband and I were scheduled to fly out at 7:15 am to go to California for a very important family matter. We do not live near the airport so we were up early to make sure we were early and nothing could go wrong. But things did go wrong. When we got to the airport we went and printed out tickets at the self checkout. We did notice that it mentioned no overhead storage for our carry on bags. So confused because we fly a lot and there is always overhead storage or they place in under the cabin. So we asked a lady that was standing in the area of self print and she looked and our tickets said we would be fine... Again we were told wrong.
Gail of Raleigh, NC," Oct. 18, 2015","On September 4 my family of 5 arrived at the airport in Anchorage to fly home to Toronto via Dallas. Four of us had carry-on sized luggage but one had a mid-sized suitcase that we knew we would have to check. Our flight to Toronto included a 12.5-hour connection at DFW (not by choice). Since none of us sleep well on planes, we were considering going to a hotel following the overnight flight to DFW. When checking the suitcase, I specifically asked the American Airlines agent ""if we only check this bag to DFW and then go to a hotel for a few hours of sleep, will we be charged a second baggage fee to check the bag in for the flight to Toronto? If so we can rearrange the bags so that we can just check it through to Toronto."" "
Modupeola of Lawrenceville, GA," Oct. 17, 2015","I purchased the basic economy ticket. When I was getting ready to board in Charlotte, the attendant mentioned that this was a new program for your airline and that customers have stated it was cost effective. However, this was not my case! I paid nearly $600 to fly from Columbus, OH to Asheville, NC. Absolutely absurd!!! In the future, I will do all I can to avoid flying with your airline and don't count on a positive recommendation from me to others! Also, stop charging for the first piece of checked in luggage!"

I called at night again because I was worried I saw it was still cancel. After almost 2 hours they answered the phone. I told them what happened. They told me that they were very sorry but the flight was canceled and they didnt' have flight for Sept 12. They gave me 1 stop flight for Sept 13. "
Linda of Baden, PA," Oct. 17, 2015","I was scheduled to fly out of Tampa International on Sunday, September, 17th to Durango, CO. I live in Sarasota, and just returned home the other day after evacuating for Hurricane Irma. I fled Florida and headed to Georgia, where I had to rent a hotel for a few nights. When I returned home I was fortunate enough not to have suffered damage. I of course have yard debris strewn about and I am still without power. The power company has estimated by the end of the day on September 22nd I will have power. With the extra costs incurred from having to leave my home, and the loss of power, I decided this was not a good time to travel."
William of Astoria, NY," Oct. 16, 2015","Hurricane Irma was mess for AA. I get it. I'm sure there were thousands who were stuck trying to get their flights changed. Unfortunately, I was in Costa Rica with a connection via Miami and I got, as the AA agent said ""the short end of the stick."" I would be stuck almost another week in Costa Rica as everything AA had was booked out or cancelled. I saw a little bit of silver lining when I found that if I could get to Mexico city, I could fly home via DFW. However, AA would not change the ticket as it is against their rules to change the country of origin on a ticket. ""We cannot do it."" However, a more accurate description is ""will not."""
Anashunderia of Plano, TX," Oct. 16, 2015","We were delayed on our AA out of Seattle due to having to wait on flight crew. Managed to make it to Dallas on time BUT had to sit on the tarmac for 20 mins waiting for a gait in order to deplane. This caused to miss our connecting flight. Next available flight is the next day. Asked about compensation for overnight hotel stay (there are 7 in our party, including a 3 year old) and were denied due to the delay being coded as weather related, which is absolutely bogus. So livid, frustrated, and tired at this point. Also found out AA has no number to call for complaints... You have to go through email so who knows if they will even read it or reply. Will never fly AA again if I can help it."
Elizabeth of Worcester, MA," Oct. 16, 2015","I was on an almost 2 hour flight (Flight AA3936) stuck sitting with one leg over my bag and the other on the edge of the aisle. Not once was I asked to check in my bag nor told it wouldn't fit on the overhead bin. By the time we landed my knees, hips and back were killing me and I had to have help from the gentleman next to me to be able to stand up. So glad there wasn't an emergency 'cause this would have been one hell of a hazard. Lesson learned not to use this airline again."
Dawn of Boca Raton, FL," Oct. 16, 2015","American Airlines‰Û_the new standard for horrible service. Oh‰Û_I mean HORRIBLE! I travel very frequently for work and have stuck to one specific airline in order to build my status with them (ie. first class upgrades often, better seat choices, free checked bags). Recently, service has taken a turn for the worse. I‰Ûªm a reasonable guy and tolerate more than most. Call it my Southern hospitality, my upbringing or my service to the community when I served in law enforcement, but I just plain put up with more‰Û_until now."
JOHN of Saint Petersburg, FL," Oct. 16, 2015","I travel 80%~ for Work and have flown with almost every airline multiple times. AA is by far the worst. Not due to their customer service/staff/delays or anything like that (at least that I‰Ûªve noticed), but their planes have no entertainment system on each seat, they do not play movies on the overhead screens, and they don‰Ûªt even have a free WiFi movie/tv option you can connect to using your phone! I‰Ûªm currently on a flight from Boston to Phoenix and was utterly shocked when I sat in my seat and noticed no form of entertainment for a cross-country flight. Delta and other airlines provide personal entertainment screens on each screen or a smartphone connect feature for 2+ hr flights, which in turn make the flights more enjoyable. Anyways, to avoid rambling on and on about the lack of technology on AA planes I‰Ûªll just say if you enjoyed traveling in the late 90s early 2000s, then AA is for you. If you want to travel in 2017 and beyond, find a different airline."
Kathleen of Tujunga, CA," Oct. 15, 2015","I had a horrible experience today on my flight back to Miami. I have been an AAdvantage member for many years now and have always chosen to be loyal to American but after today's experience that may change. The onboarding process was fine and the flight was on time, which to be honest is rare but I was happy. When the snacks and beverage cart came the attendant did not smile, looked unhappy to take our beverage order, handed me and my husband 2 cookies, I then I told her, ""Can we just get pretzels?"" She said ""Then I need the cookies back."" I was honestly appalled."
Heike of Clermont, FL," Oct. 15, 2015","Don't deserve single star. Also, I have a flight from Chicago to Minneapolis 5 hours from now. And they have seats available on the earlier flight but won't give you without charging $75. They are ok to make you wait or fly a flight with empty seats but no customer delight which is no cost to them. No customer driven company and not looking for going extra mile to make customer happy. Never travel on American Airlines again."
Chantiriny of Lowell, MA," Oct. 15, 2015","Worst experience ever with AA never again, they treated my dad like garbage, they humiliated my dad in front of my niece travelling with him and in front of all passengers, just because my dad is ** and not fluent in English. I wish I could sue them for discrimination against my dad for not speaking English fluent instead of offering assistance in Spanish which, the sky harbor airport in Arizona has plenty of bilingual employees. DO NOT FLY AA EVER, pay more with a different airline. The only reason why my dad and niece flew AA to go to my brother's funeral, thank you AA for the worst day ever. It's a shame I have to put a star instead of no stars service."
Tammy of Pittsburgh, PA," Oct. 13, 2015","This American Airlines review is out of frustration due to a lot of things. They're a disgrace! The employees are rude, there is no leg room, no entertainment, and treat people like herds of sheep. They have a ""New"" rule where they charge $50 at the gate to carry on your luggage. Are you kidding me? $50 for a carry on? And I can't even use the overhead bin! Disgraceful! Basically these guys are crooks! They're a disgrace. Last time I flew with American their flight was delayed by 2 hours and we ended up missing our connecting flight because it was the last flight out. We ended up having to stay an extra day and had to pay $100 for a hotel. We missed my sisters wedding. On the way back we ended up stuck on the tarmac for 2 hours. Of course!"
A. of Memphis, TN," Oct. 13, 2015","I booked a ticket back when the hurricane were hitting down south every other week. Because of that I was not able to attend my trip in GA. They told me I had up to a year to use my ticket. So when I try to rebook my ticket they are now close to $500. Mind you this is the highest rate out of all the airlines for my particular dates, I asked for a refund because I didn't wanna double what I paid the first time and I was told by the Supervisor (Willie ** in Dallas ) that my only option was to ""use it or lost it"". Being a supervisor myself I thought the tone in which he said it was very careless and he didn't try to help the situation at all. I would never talk to my customers the way he spoke to me especially after losing out on $300!!"
Samantha of Nederland, TX," Oct. 12, 2015","I just completed a flight on American Airlines. I had read negative reviews, but I found the American Airlines people I had contact with were great, tried to provide all the service they could because our flight had been cancelled due WX and had to layover at ORD. My complaint is the phoney coupon given for a hotel room for a ""discounted rate"". The coupon has nothing to do with American Airlines, but is only a hotel booking service. When I called the phone number provided I was told the only available room was 10 miles away and given a rate of $80.00. It was getting late in the evening so took it. Then was advised there was a $15 service charge to book the room. American Airline paid none of this. The shuttle bus to the hotel was packed (Other delayed passengers). When I got home I checked the hotel rate and found the same room went for $105. I ""saved"" $10. The hotel was a Holiday Inn Express. Room not bad."

She made up some baloney about Homeland Security not letting people fly with spots on their passport. I told her I checked their website and there was no mention of anything like that. She then claimed, ""Oh, they don't tell you."" I said, ""Then how are you supposed to know?""

Asked about compensation for overnight hotel stay (there are 7 in our party, including a 3 year old) and were denied due to the delay being coded as weather related, which is absolutely bogus. So livid, frustrated, and tired at this point. Also found out AA has no number to call for complaints... You have to go through email so who knows if they will even read it or reply. Will never fly AA again if I can help it."
Chris of Los Angeles, CA," Oct. 2, 2015","I was on an almost 2 hour flight (Flight AA3936) stuck sitting with one leg over my bag and the other on the edge of the aisle. Not once was I asked to check in my bag nor told it wouldn't fit on the overhead bin. By the time we landed my knees, hips and back were killing me and I had to have help from the gentleman next to me to be able to stand up. So glad there wasn't an emergency 'cause this would have been one hell of a hazard. Lesson learned not to use this airline again."
Scott of Sheridan, OR," Oct. 2, 2015","American Airlines‰Û_the new standard for horrible service. Oh‰Û_I mean HORRIBLE! I travel very frequently for work and have stuck to one specific airline in order to build my status with them (ie. first class upgrades often, better seat choices, free checked bags). Recently, service has taken a turn for the worse. I‰Ûªm a reasonable guy and tolerate more than most. Call it my Southern hospitality, my upbringing or my service to the community when I served in law enforcement, but I just plain put up with more‰Û_until now."
Dara of Compton, CA," Oct. 1, 2015","I travel 80%~ for Work and have flown with almost every airline multiple times. AA is by far the worst. Not due to their customer service/staff/delays or anything like that (at least that I‰Ûªve noticed), but their planes have no entertainment system on each seat, they do not play movies on the overhead screens, and they don‰Ûªt even have a free WiFi movie/tv option you can connect to using your phone! I‰Ûªm currently on a flight from Boston to Phoenix and was utterly shocked when I sat in my seat and noticed no form of entertainment for a cross-country flight. Delta and other airlines provide personal entertainment screens on each screen or a smartphone connect feature for 2+ hr flights, which in turn make the flights more enjoyable. Anyways, to avoid rambling on and on about the lack of technology on AA planes I‰Ûªll just say if you enjoyed traveling in the late 90s early 2000s, then AA is for you. If you want to travel in 2017 and beyond, find a different airline."
Kirk of Mckinney, TX," Oct. 1, 2015","I had a horrible experience today on my flight back to Miami. I have been an AAdvantage member for many years now and have always chosen to be loyal to American but after today's experience that may change. The onboarding process was fine and the flight was on time, which to be honest is rare but I was happy. When the snacks and beverage cart came the attendant did not smile, looked unhappy to take our beverage order, handed me and my husband 2 cookies, I then I told her, ""Can we just get pretzels?"" She said ""Then I need the cookies back."" I was honestly appalled."
Janet of Prescott, AZ," Oct. 1, 2015","Don't deserve single star. Also, I have a flight from Chicago to Minneapolis 5 hours from now. And they have seats available on the earlier flight but won't give you without charging $75. They are ok to make you wait or fly a flight with empty seats but no customer delight which is no cost to them. No customer driven company and not looking for going extra mile to make customer happy. Never travel on American Airlines again."
Bob of Exeter, NH," Oct. 1, 2015","Worst experience ever with AA never again, they treated my dad like garbage, they humiliated my dad in front of my niece travelling with him and in front of all passengers, just because my dad is ** and not fluent in English. I wish I could sue them for discrimination against my dad for not speaking English fluent instead of offering assistance in Spanish which, the sky harbor airport in Arizona has plenty of bilingual employees. DO NOT FLY AA EVER, pay more with a different airline. The only reason why my dad and niece flew AA to go to my brother's funeral, thank you AA for the worst day ever. It's a shame I have to put a star instead of no stars service."
MM of Golden Valley, MN," Oct. 1, 2015","This American Airlines review is out of frustration due to a lot of things. They're a disgrace! The employees are rude, there is no leg room, no entertainment, and treat people like herds of sheep. They have a ""New"" rule where they charge $50 at the gate to carry on your luggage. Are you kidding me? $50 for a carry on? And I can't even use the overhead bin! Disgraceful! Basically these guys are crooks! They're a disgrace. Last time I flew with American their flight was delayed by 2 hours and we ended up missing our connecting flight because it was the last flight out. We ended up having to stay an extra day and had to pay $100 for a hotel. We missed my sisters wedding. On the way back we ended up stuck on the tarmac for 2 hours. Of course!"
Levi of Grand Junction, CO," Sept. 30, 2015","I booked a ticket back when the hurricane were hitting down south every other week. Because of that I was not able to attend my trip in GA. They told me I had up to a year to use my ticket. So when I try to rebook my ticket they are now close to $500. Mind you this is the highest rate out of all the airlines for my particular dates, I asked for a refund because I didn't wanna double what I paid the first time and I was told by the Supervisor (Willie ** in Dallas ) that my only option was to ""use it or lost it"". Being a supervisor myself I thought the tone in which he said it was very careless and he didn't try to help the situation at all. I would never talk to my customers the way he spoke to me especially after losing out on $300!!"
Tim of Wheelersburg, OH," Sept. 30, 2015","I just completed a flight on American Airlines. I had read negative reviews, but I found the American Airlines people I had contact with were great, tried to provide all the service they could because our flight had been cancelled due WX and had to layover at ORD. My complaint is the phoney coupon given for a hotel room for a ""discounted rate"". The coupon has nothing to do with American Airlines, but is only a hotel booking service. When I called the phone number provided I was told the only available room was 10 miles away and given a rate of $80.00. It was getting late in the evening so took it. Then was advised there was a $15 service charge to book the room. American Airline paid none of this. The shuttle bus to the hotel was packed (Other delayed passengers). When I got home I checked the hotel rate and found the same room went for $105. I ""saved"" $10. The hotel was a Holiday Inn Express. Room not bad."

She made up some baloney about Homeland Security not letting people fly with spots on their passport. I told her I checked their website and there was no mention of anything like that. She then claimed, ""Oh, they don't tell you."" I said, ""Then how are you supposed to know?""

While I was away, I heard the news that my dad had passed away. In which, I contacted American Airlines right away and asked if anything can be done. I wanted to fly back before my actual trip date, due to obvious reasons. I even offered to provide them with a death certificate if need be (although, I don't think that is even something they should ask for right away). I spoke to 3 different customer service reps who were all horrible to speak with. They had zero compassion and empathy and just dismissed me as if what I was experiencing was far from a big deal to them. "
Jia of Sewanee, TN," Sept. 27, 2015","I was on the plane for 14 hours due to a delay. Sitting in a broken seat that would not recline. I told the stewardess and she could care less, said nothing she can do. After I got home I contacted the airline and they issued me a fourteen dollar credit. I had paid 197.34 dollars for preferred seats. The worst flight of my life, never again w/ this airline."
Anu of Sahalahti, Other," Sept. 26, 2015","Overall, (Un)American Airlines continues to disappoint. I really only ever fly with AA as a last resort, and I can't see any reason to recommend traveling with AA. I was prior active duty Army, and now I'm a reservist, and only American Airlines makes me feel like my service is less important now. United, Southwest, Jet Blue, Delta, every other airline doesn't discriminate between Active Duty and Reserve/Guardsmen when it comes to bag fees. So, along with uncomfortable, outdated planes and poor service, I spent a $100 checking bags to and from my destination."
Penny- of North Monmouth, ME," Sept. 25, 2015",American Airlines is the worst airlines to fly anywhere. They cram you in the seats with no leg room or any room for that matter. I requested a wheelchair at airport and waited 30 minutes upon someone finally arriving. They took me the wrong way to my next check in and I missed my flight. They said I would have to rebook my ticket and just wait for the next flight. Attendant at the gate was very disrespectful and not helpful at all. I had no control over this situation at all. Not to mention when I did finally arrive at my destination that I requested a wheelchair prior to my departure.
Christy of Goldsboro, NC," Sept. 24, 2015","American Airlines is the worst airline in THE WORLD, and should change their name, it is utterly disgraceful that as an American they use this name. Their policy is to not apologize for anything, to be as rude as possible to people who are basically held hostage to them and their BS policies like closing the door to the gate while people are standing there then charging them money to rebook their flight, not caring at all about the bags on their way to a destination without the owners there to pick them up. Then being told when lodging a complaint that it was going in one ear and out the other. I have never been treated so poorly in my life, I will never again fly with this airline, I hope they go bankrupt and get the worst karma life can give. Oh yeah and I get to fly with them tomorrow. :/"
katherine of London , Other," Sept. 24, 2015","Very disappointed. Unlikely I will ever choose American Airlines again. I didn't make my flight in the spring. I was given a voucher to use for future travel. Now I'm being told I can only use it myself, and not for my family. I don't want to use it for myself. What difference does it make? I'm being told different things by different people. The last guy hung up on me and I wasn't even rude to him. This is how AA does business? All I want is to not be penalized for cancelling a flight that was beyond my control. If you have a voucher it should be flexible to use for anyone. AA is the WORST! Hope they go out of business for this nonsense. Airline travel is a joke."
B. of Gilbert, AZ," Sept. 23, 2015","American Airlines canceled my 92-year-old father-in-law's flight to Key West due to Hurricane Irma. On that day American Airline was contacted and the representative said there would be no problem re-booking, just use the reference number. American Airlines even went on TV and said they would waive re-booking fees. Today when calling to re-book the flight and after 57 minutes on the phone, I was told the flight could not be re-booked because it was in their notes I requested a refund. At no time did I request a refund and American Airlines could not locate any record of a refund request. Even so, American Airlines still insisted they could not re-book the flight or issue a refund. If we did not have enough trouble dealing with a Cat 4 hurricane and its devastating aftermath, now American Airlines is adding to the misery. All my father-in-law wants is to come to Key West and see that everyone is alright. Thanks, AA."
Bernard of Corny Del Mar, CA," Sept. 23, 2015",I bought tickets for my mother in law and son to meet my wife and I in Colorado. We had traveled on different airlines due to connections and therefore were going back on different airlines. My wife and I left on our airplane. My mother in law and son were stranded as the plane had a mechanical. This was 8 AM and the bottom line was it didn't get fixed that day. American gave them a 12.00 voucher good in the terminal and did nothing to get them a room as the rooms they usually used weren't available.
Butool of Dubai, Other," Sept. 22, 2015","I booked 2 separate flights on American Airlines in Economy since I pay for my air travel. On one they pre-assigned me a back-of-plane middle seat and said that I was required to pay some increased fee for window, aisle or closer to the front. On the second flight they said I have to wait until I reach the boarding gate for any seat. This is ridiculous and unacceptable. The airline has sufficient revenue to - just a suggestion - increase the ""base"" fare to cover a first-come-first-served seat selection and not put everyone into 3rd class or worse status. If they want to surcharge certain premium seats, like middle seats toward the front, that's OK, but this behavior is totally unacceptable and I refuse to fly them (or any airline) that abuses their passengers."
jeff of South Lake Tahoe, CA," Sept. 21, 2015",Well I looked into changing my flight for my fiance and I to go home a day earlier... only to discover that American charges $200.00 a ticket PLUS the difference in price tickets! LIKE THAT IS GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE! So for the price of another ticket I can change my flight! I will be looking elsewhere for flights in the future. I have already paid for a flight and now you are trying to rip me off even more!?! Out of touch and terrible service to a customer of over 5 years. I will be going elsewhere where I don't get bent over the table. Thank you American!
Karen of Hamlin, NY," Sept. 21, 2015","I originally booked my flight to Miami from Washington, DC back in July 2017. I was scheduled to fly September 13-18, 2017. I, like many, had to cancel my trip because of hurricane Irma. I was informed by two customer service representatives that I would be able to rebook my flight to Miami with no additional charges in fare and no change fees. Of course, when it comes time to book my flight, I'm informed about a change fee. I told the agent, I was reassured twice that I would not be charged any additional fees because my initial cancellation was weather related. "
Mj of Lindenhurst, NY," Sept. 21, 2015","American Airlines is full of **. Our cruise was cancelled due to Hurricane Irma. It was beyond our control and the airline stated there was nothing that they could do. No partial credit, changes or anything! I will not be flying with them anymore!"
Zoe of Pacific Palisades, CA," Sept. 21, 2015",My husband and I were scheduled to fly out at 7:15 am to go to California for a very important family matter. We do not live near the airport so we were up early to make sure we were early and nothing could go wrong. But things did go wrong. When we got to the airport we went and printed out tickets at the self checkout. We did notice that it mentioned no overhead storage for our carry on bags. So confused because we fly a lot and there is always overhead storage or they place in under the cabin. So we asked a lady that was standing in the area of self print and she looked and our tickets said we would be fine... Again we were told wrong.
Anita of Dubai, Other," Sept. 20, 2015","On September 4 my family of 5 arrived at the airport in Anchorage to fly home to Toronto via Dallas. Four of us had carry-on sized luggage but one had a mid-sized suitcase that we knew we would have to check. Our flight to Toronto included a 12.5-hour connection at DFW (not by choice). Since none of us sleep well on planes, we were considering going to a hotel following the overnight flight to DFW. When checking the suitcase, I specifically asked the American Airlines agent ""if we only check this bag to DFW and then go to a hotel for a few hours of sleep, will we be charged a second baggage fee to check the bag in for the flight to Toronto? If so we can rearrange the bags so that we can just check it through to Toronto."" "
Jessica of Houston, TX," Sept. 19, 2015","I purchased the basic economy ticket. When I was getting ready to board in Charlotte, the attendant mentioned that this was a new program for your airline and that customers have stated it was cost effective. However, this was not my case! I paid nearly $600 to fly from Columbus, OH to Asheville, NC. Absolutely absurd!!! In the future, I will do all I can to avoid flying with your airline and don't count on a positive recommendation from me to others! Also, stop charging for the first piece of checked in luggage!"

I called at night again because I was worried I saw it was still cancel. After almost 2 hours they answered the phone. I told them what happened. They told me that they were very sorry but the flight was canceled and they didnt' have flight for Sept 12. They gave me 1 stop flight for Sept 13. "
Anne of Warwick , NY," Sept. 16, 2015","I was scheduled to fly out of Tampa International on Sunday, September, 17th to Durango, CO. I live in Sarasota, and just returned home the other day after evacuating for Hurricane Irma. I fled Florida and headed to Georgia, where I had to rent a hotel for a few nights. When I returned home I was fortunate enough not to have suffered damage. I of course have yard debris strewn about and I am still without power. The power company has estimated by the end of the day on September 22nd I will have power. With the extra costs incurred from having to leave my home, and the loss of power, I decided this was not a good time to travel."
stephanie of Culver City, CA," Sept. 16, 2015","Hurricane Irma was mess for AA. I get it. I'm sure there were thousands who were stuck trying to get their flights changed. Unfortunately, I was in Costa Rica with a connection via Miami and I got, as the AA agent said ""the short end of the stick."" I would be stuck almost another week in Costa Rica as everything AA had was booked out or cancelled. I saw a little bit of silver lining when I found that if I could get to Mexico city, I could fly home via DFW. However, AA would not change the ticket as it is against their rules to change the country of origin on a ticket. ""We cannot do it."" However, a more accurate description is ""will not."""

The last guy hung up on me and I wasn't even rude to him. This is how AA does business? All I want is to not be penalized for cancelling a flight that was beyond my control. If you have a voucher it should be flexible to use for anyone. AA is the WORST! Hope they go out of business for this nonsense. Airline travel is a joke."
Kirk of Chandler, AZ," Sept. 7, 2015","American Airlines canceled my 92-year-old father-in-law's flight to Key West due to Hurricane Irma. On that day American Airline was contacted and the representative said there would be no problem re-booking, just use the reference number. American Airlines even went on TV and said they would waive re-booking fees. Today when calling to re-book the flight and after 57 minutes on the phone, I was told the flight could not be re-booked because it was in their notes I requested a refund. At no time did I request a refund and American Airlines could not locate any record of a refund request. Even so, American Airlines still insisted they could not re-book the flight or issue a refund. If we did not have enough trouble dealing with a Cat 4 hurricane and its devastating aftermath, now American Airlines is adding to the misery. All my father-in-law wants is to come to Key West and see that everyone is alright. Thanks, AA."
j of Boynton Beach, FL," Sept. 6, 2015",I bought tickets for my mother in law and son to meet my wife and I in Colorado. We had traveled on different airlines due to connections and therefore were going back on different airlines. My wife and I left on our airplane. My mother in law and son were stranded as the plane had a mechanical. This was 8 AM and the bottom line was it didn't get fixed that day. American gave them a 12.00 voucher good in the terminal and did nothing to get them a room as the rooms they usually used weren't available.
Rich of Broomall, PA," Sept. 4, 2015","I booked 2 separate flights on American Airlines in Economy since I pay for my air travel. On one they pre-assigned me a back-of-plane middle seat and said that I was required to pay some increased fee for window, aisle or closer to the front. On the second flight they said I have to wait until I reach the boarding gate for any seat. This is ridiculous and unacceptable. The airline has sufficient revenue to - just a suggestion - increase the ""base"" fare to cover a first-come-first-served seat selection and not put everyone into 3rd class or worse status. If they want to surcharge certain premium seats, like middle seats toward the front, that's OK, but this behavior is totally unacceptable and I refuse to fly them (or any airline) that abuses their passengers."
barbara of Laguna Niguel, CA," Sept. 4, 2015",Well I looked into changing my flight for my fiance and I to go home a day earlier... only to discover that American charges $200.00 a ticket PLUS the difference in price tickets! LIKE THAT IS GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE! So for the price of another ticket I can change my flight! I will be looking elsewhere for flights in the future. I have already paid for a flight and now you are trying to rip me off even more!?! Out of touch and terrible service to a customer of over 5 years. I will be going elsewhere where I don't get bent over the table. Thank you American!
Janice of Potterville, MI," Sept. 4, 2015","I originally booked my flight to Miami from Washington, DC back in July 2017. I was scheduled to fly September 13-18, 2017. I, like many, had to cancel my trip because of hurricane Irma. I was informed by two customer service representatives that I would be able to rebook my flight to Miami with no additional charges in fare and no change fees. Of course, when it comes time to book my flight, I'm informed about a change fee. I told the agent, I was reassured twice that I would not be charged any additional fees because my initial cancellation was weather related. "
Howard of Buford, GA," Sept. 2, 2015","American Airlines is full of **. Our cruise was cancelled due to Hurricane Irma. It was beyond our control and the airline stated there was nothing that they could do. No partial credit, changes or anything! I will not be flying with them anymore!"
C of Valley Center, CA," Sept. 2, 2015",My husband and I were scheduled to fly out at 7:15 am to go to California for a very important family matter. We do not live near the airport so we were up early to make sure we were early and nothing could go wrong. But things did go wrong. When we got to the airport we went and printed out tickets at the self checkout. We did notice that it mentioned no overhead storage for our carry on bags. So confused because we fly a lot and there is always overhead storage or they place in under the cabin. So we asked a lady that was standing in the area of self print and she looked and our tickets said we would be fine... Again we were told wrong.
RD of Signal Hill, CA," Sept. 2, 2015","On September 4 my family of 5 arrived at the airport in Anchorage to fly home to Toronto via Dallas. Four of us had carry-on sized luggage but one had a mid-sized suitcase that we knew we would have to check. Our flight to Toronto included a 12.5-hour connection at DFW (not by choice). Since none of us sleep well on planes, we were considering going to a hotel following the overnight flight to DFW. When checking the suitcase, I specifically asked the American Airlines agent ""if we only check this bag to DFW and then go to a hotel for a few hours of sleep, will we be charged a second baggage fee to check the bag in for the flight to Toronto? If so we can rearrange the bags so that we can just check it through to Toronto."" "

In the future, I will do all I can to avoid flying with your airline and don't count on a positive recommendation from me to others! Also, stop charging for the first piece of checked in luggage!"

Ashley of Triangle, VA," Aug. 31, 2015","I was scheduled to fly out of Tampa International on Sunday, September, 17th to Durango, CO. I live in Sarasota, and just returned home the other day after evacuating for Hurricane Irma. I fled Florida and headed to Georgia, where I had to rent a hotel for a few nights. When I returned home I was fortunate enough not to have suffered damage. I of course have yard debris strewn about and I am still without power. The power company has estimated by the end of the day on September 22nd I will have power. With the extra costs incurred from having to leave my home, and the loss of power, I decided this was not a good time to travel."
Jennifer of Rochester, MI," Aug. 31, 2015","Hurricane Irma was mess for AA. I get it. I'm sure there were thousands who were stuck trying to get their flights changed. Unfortunately, I was in Costa Rica with a connection via Miami and I got, as the AA agent said ""the short end of the stick."" I would be stuck almost another week in Costa Rica as everything AA had was booked out or cancelled. I saw a little bit of silver lining when I found that if I could get to Mexico city, I could fly home via DFW. However, AA would not change the ticket as it is against their rules to change the country of origin on a ticket. ""We cannot do it."" However, a more accurate description is ""will not."""
Monica of Santa Cruz, CA," Aug. 31, 2015","We were delayed on our AA out of Seattle due to having to wait on flight crew. Managed to make it to Dallas on time BUT had to sit on the tarmac for 20 mins waiting for a gait in order to deplane. This caused to miss our connecting flight. Next available flight is the next day. Asked about compensation for overnight hotel stay (there are 7 in our party, including a 3 year old) and were denied due to the delay being coded as weather related, which is absolutely bogus. So livid, frustrated, and tired at this point. Also found out AA has no number to call for complaints... You have to go through email so who knows if they will even read it or reply. Will never fly AA again if I can help it."
Cori of Arvada, CO," Aug. 31, 2015","I was on an almost 2 hour flight (Flight AA3936) stuck sitting with one leg over my bag and the other on the edge of the aisle. Not once was I asked to check in my bag nor told it wouldn't fit on the overhead bin. By the time we landed my knees, hips and back were killing me and I had to have help from the gentleman next to me to be able to stand up. So glad there wasn't an emergency 'cause this would have been one hell of a hazard. Lesson learned not to use this airline again."
Diane of Oakland, OR," Aug. 29, 2015","American Airlines‰Û_the new standard for horrible service. Oh‰Û_I mean HORRIBLE! I travel very frequently for work and have stuck to one specific airline in order to build my status with them (ie. first class upgrades often, better seat choices, free checked bags). Recently, service has taken a turn for the worse. I‰Ûªm a reasonable guy and tolerate more than most. Call it my Southern hospitality, my upbringing or my service to the community when I served in law enforcement, but I just plain put up with more‰Û_until now."
Jessica of Richmond, VA," Aug. 29, 2015","I travel 80%~ for Work and have flown with almost every airline multiple times. AA is by far the worst. Not due to their customer service/staff/delays or anything like that (at least that I‰Ûªve noticed), but their planes have no entertainment system on each seat, they do not play movies on the overhead screens, and they don‰Ûªt even have a free WiFi movie/tv option you can connect to using your phone! I‰Ûªm currently on a flight from Boston to Phoenix and was utterly shocked when I sat in my seat and noticed no form of entertainment for a cross-country flight. Delta and other airlines provide personal entertainment screens on each screen or a smartphone connect feature for 2+ hr flights, which in turn make the flights more enjoyable. Anyways, to avoid rambling on and on about the lack of technology on AA planes I‰Ûªll just say if you enjoyed traveling in the late 90s early 2000s, then AA is for you. If you want to travel in 2017 and beyond, find a different airline."
M of Dallas, TX," Aug. 29, 2015","I had a horrible experience today on my flight back to Miami. I have been an AAdvantage member for many years now and have always chosen to be loyal to American but after today's experience that may change. The onboarding process was fine and the flight was on time, which to be honest is rare but I was happy. When the snacks and beverage cart came the attendant did not smile, looked unhappy to take our beverage order, handed me and my husband 2 cookies, I then I told her, ""Can we just get pretzels?"" She said ""Then I need the cookies back."" I was honestly appalled."
Iris of Gastonia, NC," Aug. 28, 2015","Don't deserve single star. Also, I have a flight from Chicago to Minneapolis 5 hours from now. And they have seats available on the earlier flight but won't give you without charging $75. They are ok to make you wait or fly a flight with empty seats but no customer delight which is no cost to them. No customer driven company and not looking for going extra mile to make customer happy. Never travel on American Airlines again."
Maria of East Boston, MA," Aug. 27, 2015","Worst experience ever with AA never again, they treated my dad like garbage, they humiliated my dad in front of my niece travelling with him and in front of all passengers, just because my dad is ** and not fluent in English. I wish I could sue them for discrimination against my dad for not speaking English fluent instead of offering assistance in Spanish which, the sky harbor airport in Arizona has plenty of bilingual employees. DO NOT FLY AA EVER, pay more with a different airline. The only reason why my dad and niece flew AA to go to my brother's funeral, thank you AA for the worst day ever. It's a shame I have to put a star instead of no stars service."
Katherine of New Martinsville, WV," Aug. 26, 2015","This American Airlines review is out of frustration due to a lot of things. They're a disgrace! The employees are rude, there is no leg room, no entertainment, and treat people like herds of sheep. They have a ""New"" rule where they charge $50 at the gate to carry on your luggage. Are you kidding me? $50 for a carry on? And I can't even use the overhead bin! Disgraceful! Basically these guys are crooks! They're a disgrace. Last time I flew with American their flight was delayed by 2 hours and we ended up missing our connecting flight because it was the last flight out. We ended up having to stay an extra day and had to pay $100 for a hotel. We missed my sisters wedding. On the way back we ended up stuck on the tarmac for 2 hours. Of course!"
John of San Antonio, TX," Aug. 26, 2015","I booked a ticket back when the hurricane were hitting down south every other week. Because of that I was not able to attend my trip in GA. They told me I had up to a year to use my ticket. So when I try to rebook my ticket they are now close to $500. Mind you this is the highest rate out of all the airlines for my particular dates, I asked for a refund because I didn't wanna double what I paid the first time and I was told by the Supervisor (Willie ** in Dallas ) that my only option was to ""use it or lost it"". Being a supervisor myself I thought the tone in which he said it was very careless and he didn't try to help the situation at all. I would never talk to my customers the way he spoke to me especially after losing out on $300!!"
Leonardo of Kissimmee, FL," Aug. 26, 2015","I just completed a flight on American Airlines. I had read negative reviews, but I found the American Airlines people I had contact with were great, tried to provide all the service they could because our flight had been cancelled due WX and had to layover at ORD. My complaint is the phoney coupon given for a hotel room for a ""discounted rate"". The coupon has nothing to do with American Airlines, but is only a hotel booking service. When I called the phone number provided I was told the only available room was 10 miles away and given a rate of $80.00. It was getting late in the evening so took it. Then was advised there was a $15 service charge to book the room. American Airline paid none of this. The shuttle bus to the hotel was packed (Other delayed passengers). When I got home I checked the hotel rate and found the same room went for $105. I ""saved"" $10. The hotel was a Holiday Inn Express. Room not bad."
Brittany of Gilbert, AZ," Aug. 26, 2015","I was en route from San Antonio Texas to Hong Kong and when checking in for the domestic portion of the flight at the ticket counter, the woman claimed there was a problem with my passport. I asked for details and she claimed ""There are spots on your passport."" I told her the passport was still valid and did not expire until the following year."" She made up some baloney about Homeland Security not letting people fly with spots on their passport. I told her I checked their website and there was no mention of anything like that. She then claimed, ""Oh, they don't tell you."" I said, ""Then how are you supposed to know?"" She then sarcastically claimed I needed glasses, so I put my glasses on and told her those so called spots are not a problem. "

While I was away, I heard the news that my dad had passed away. In which, I contacted American Airlines right away and asked if anything can be done. I wanted to fly back before my actual trip date, due to obvious reasons. I even offered to provide them with a death certificate if need be (although, I don't think that is even something they should ask for right away). I spoke to 3 different customer service reps who were all horrible to speak with. They had zero compassion and empathy and just dismissed me as if what I was experiencing was far from a big deal to them. "
Ernest of Decatur, GA," Aug. 25, 2015","I was on the plane for 14 hours due to a delay. Sitting in a broken seat that would not recline. I told the stewardess and she could care less, said nothing she can do. After I got home I contacted the airline and they issued me a fourteen dollar credit. I had paid 197.34 dollars for preferred seats. The worst flight of my life, never again w/ this airline."
Michelle of Eastchester, NY," Aug. 24, 2015","Overall, (Un)American Airlines continues to disappoint. I really only ever fly with AA as a last resort, and I can't see any reason to recommend traveling with AA. I was prior active duty Army, and now I'm a reservist, and only American Airlines makes me feel like my service is less important now. United, Southwest, Jet Blue, Delta, every other airline doesn't discriminate between Active Duty and Reserve/Guardsmen when it comes to bag fees. So, along with uncomfortable, outdated planes and poor service, I spent a $100 checking bags to and from my destination."
james of Desoto, Other," Aug. 24, 2015",American Airlines is the worst airlines to fly anywhere. They cram you in the seats with no leg room or any room for that matter. I requested a wheelchair at airport and waited 30 minutes upon someone finally arriving. They took me the wrong way to my next check in and I missed my flight. They said I would have to rebook my ticket and just wait for the next flight. Attendant at the gate was very disrespectful and not helpful at all. I had no control over this situation at all. Not to mention when I did finally arrive at my destination that I requested a wheelchair prior to my departure.
B of Omaha, NE," Aug. 24, 2015","American Airlines is the worst airline in THE WORLD, and should change their name, it is utterly disgraceful that as an American they use this name. Their policy is to not apologize for anything, to be as rude as possible to people who are basically held hostage to them and their BS policies like closing the door to the gate while people are standing there then charging them money to rebook their flight, not caring at all about the bags on their way to a destination without the owners there to pick them up. Then being told when lodging a complaint that it was going in one ear and out the other. I have never been treated so poorly in my life, I will never again fly with this airline, I hope they go bankrupt and get the worst karma life can give. Oh yeah and I get to fly with them tomorrow. :/"

Urvi of Norfolk, VA," Aug. 16, 2015","Don't deserve single star. Also, I have a flight from Chicago to Minneapolis 5 hours from now. And they have seats available on the earlier flight but won't give you without charging $75. They are ok to make you wait or fly a flight with empty seats but no customer delight which is no cost to them. No customer driven company and not looking for going extra mile to make customer happy. Never travel on American Airlines again."
Doris of Grand Junctio, CO," Aug. 15, 2015","Worst experience ever with AA never again, they treated my dad like garbage, they humiliated my dad in front of my niece travelling with him and in front of all passengers, just because my dad is ** and not fluent in English. I wish I could sue them for discrimination against my dad for not speaking English fluent instead of offering assistance in Spanish which, the sky harbor airport in Arizona has plenty of bilingual employees. DO NOT FLY AA EVER, pay more with a different airline. The only reason why my dad and niece flew AA to go to my brother's funeral, thank you AA for the worst day ever. It's a shame I have to put a star instead of no stars service."
Kit of Garland, TX," Aug. 15, 2015","This American Airlines review is out of frustration due to a lot of things. They're a disgrace! The employees are rude, there is no leg room, no entertainment, and treat people like herds of sheep. They have a ""New"" rule where they charge $50 at the gate to carry on your luggage. Are you kidding me? $50 for a carry on? And I can't even use the overhead bin! Disgraceful! Basically these guys are crooks! They're a disgrace. Last time I flew with American their flight was delayed by 2 hours and we ended up missing our connecting flight because it was the last flight out. We ended up having to stay an extra day and had to pay $100 for a hotel. We missed my sisters wedding. On the way back we ended up stuck on the tarmac for 2 hours. Of course!"

They told me I had up to a year to use my ticket. So when I try to rebook my ticket they are now close to $500. Mind you this is the highest rate out of all the airlines for my particular dates, I asked for a refund because I didn't wanna double what I paid the first time and I was told by the Supervisor (Willie ** in Dallas ) that my only option was to ""use it or lost it"". Being a supervisor myself I thought the tone in which he said it was very careless and he didn't try to help the situation at all. I would never talk to my customers the way he spoke to me especially after losing out on $300!!"
michael of Coral Springs, FL," Aug. 14, 2015","I just completed a flight on American Airlines. I had read negative reviews, but I found the American Airlines people I had contact with were great, tried to provide all the service they could because our flight had been cancelled due WX and had to layover at ORD. My complaint is the phoney coupon given for a hotel room for a ""discounted rate"". The coupon has nothing to do with American Airlines, but is only a hotel booking service. When I called the phone number provided I was told the only available room was 10 miles away and given a rate of $80.00. It was getting late in the evening so took it. Then was advised there was a $15 service charge to book the room. American Airline paid none of this. The shuttle bus to the hotel was packed (Other delayed passengers). When I got home I checked the hotel rate and found the same room went for $105. I ""saved"" $10. The hotel was a Holiday Inn Express. Room not bad."

Lila of Alpharetta, GA," Aug. 13, 2015","Overall, (Un)American Airlines continues to disappoint.

United, Southwest, Jet Blue, Delta, every other airline doesn't discriminate between Active Duty and Reserve/Guardsmen when it comes to bag fees. So, along with uncomfortable, outdated planes and poor service, I spent a $100 checking bags to and from my destination."
Sheila of Louisville, KY," Aug. 13, 2015",American Airlines is the worst airlines to fly anywhere. They cram you in the seats with no leg room or any room for that matter. I requested a wheelchair at airport and waited 30 minutes upon someone finally arriving. They took me the wrong way to my next check in and I missed my flight. They said I would have to rebook my ticket and just wait for the next flight. Attendant at the gate was very disrespectful and not helpful at all. I had no control over this situation at all. Not to mention when I did finally arrive at my destination that I requested a wheelchair prior to my departure.
Julio of Doral, FL," Aug. 13, 2015","American Airlines is the worst airline in THE WORLD, and should change their name, it is utterly disgraceful that as an American they use this name. Their policy is to not apologize for anything, to be as rude as possible to people who are basically held hostage to them and their BS policies like closing the door to the gate while people are standing there then charging them money to rebook their flight, not caring at all about the bags on their way to a destination without the owners there to pick them up. Then being told when lodging a complaint that it was going in one ear and out the other. I have never been treated so poorly in my life, I will never again fly with this airline, I hope they go bankrupt and get the worst karma life can give. Oh yeah and I get to fly with them tomorrow. :/"
Clifford of Miami, FL," Aug. 13, 2015","Very disappointed. Unlikely I will ever choose American Airlines again. I didn't make my flight in the spring. I was given a voucher to use for future travel. Now I'm being told I can only use it myself, and not for my family. I don't want to use it for myself. What difference does it make? I'm being told different things by different people. The last guy hung up on me and I wasn't even rude to him. This is how AA does business? All I want is to not be penalized for cancelling a flight that was beyond my control. If you have a voucher it should be flexible to use for anyone. AA is the WORST! Hope they go out of business for this nonsense. Airline travel is a joke."
Megan of Miami, FL," Aug. 13, 2015","American Airlines canceled my 92-year-old father-in-law's flight to Key West due to Hurricane Irma. On that day American Airline was contacted and the representative said there would be no problem re-booking, just use the reference number. American Airlines even went on TV and said they would waive re-booking fees. Today when calling to re-book the flight and after 57 minutes on the phone, I was told the flight could not be re-booked because it was in their notes I requested a refund. At no time did I request a refund and American Airlines could not locate any record of a refund request. Even so, American Airlines still insisted they could not re-book the flight or issue a refund. If we did not have enough trouble dealing with a Cat 4 hurricane and its devastating aftermath, now American Airlines is adding to the misery. All my father-in-law wants is to come to Key West and see that everyone is alright. Thanks, AA."
A. J. of Pittsburgh, PA," Aug. 12, 2015",I bought tickets for my mother in law and son to meet my wife and I in Colorado. We had traveled on different airlines due to connections and therefore were going back on different airlines. My wife and I left on our airplane. My mother in law and son were stranded as the plane had a mechanical. This was 8 AM and the bottom line was it didn't get fixed that day. American gave them a 12.00 voucher good in the terminal and did nothing to get them a room as the rooms they usually used weren't available.
imelda of La Joya, TX," Aug. 12, 2015","I booked 2 separate flights on American Airlines in Economy since I pay for my air travel.

On the second flight they said I have to wait until I reach the boarding gate for any seat. This is ridiculous and unacceptable. The airline has sufficient revenue to - just a suggestion - increase the ""base"" fare to cover a first-come-first-served seat selection and not put everyone into 3rd class or worse status. If they want to surcharge certain premium seats, like middle seats toward the front, that's OK, but this behavior is totally unacceptable and I refuse to fly them (or any airline) that abuses their passengers."
Lynette of Rancho Santa Fe, CA," Aug. 12, 2015",Well I looked into changing my flight for my fiance and I to go home a day earlier... only to discover that American charges $200.00 a ticket PLUS the difference in price tickets! LIKE THAT IS GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE! So for the price of another ticket I can change my flight! I will be looking elsewhere for flights in the future. I have already paid for a flight and now you are trying to rip me off even more!?! Out of touch and terrible service to a customer of over 5 years.

I was informed by two customer service representatives that I would be able to rebook my flight to Miami with no additional charges in fare and no change fees. Of course, when it comes time to book my flight, I'm informed about a change fee. I told the agent, I was reassured twice that I would not be charged any additional fees because my initial cancellation was weather related. "

susan of Peterhead, Other," Aug. 12, 2015",My husband and I were scheduled to fly out at 7:15 am to go to California for a very important family matter. We do not live near the airport so we were up early to make sure we were early and nothing could go wrong. But things did go wrong. When we got to the airport we went and printed out tickets at the self checkout. We did notice that it mentioned no overhead storage for our carry on bags. So confused because we fly a lot and there is always overhead storage or they place in under the cabin. So we asked a lady that was standing in the area of self print and she looked and our tickets said we would be fine... Again we were told wrong.
Anthony of Austin, TX," Aug. 11, 2015","On September 4 my family of 5 arrived at the airport in Anchorage to fly home to Toronto via Dallas. Four of us had carry-on sized luggage but one had a mid-sized suitcase that we knew we would have to check. Our flight to Toronto included a 12.5-hour connection at DFW (not by choice). Since none of us sleep well on planes, we were considering going to a hotel following the overnight flight to DFW. When checking the suitcase, I specifically asked the American Airlines agent ""if we only check this bag to DFW and then go to a hotel for a few hours of sleep, will we be charged a second baggage fee to check the bag in for the flight to Toronto? If so we can rearrange the bags so that we can just check it through to Toronto."" "

In the future, I will do all I can to avoid flying with your airline and don't count on a positive recommendation from me to others! Also, stop charging for the first piece of checked in luggage!"

They told me that they were very sorry but the flight was canceled and they didnt' have flight for Sept 12. They gave me 1 stop flight for Sept 13. "
Dominick of Stockton, CA," Aug. 11, 2015","I was scheduled to fly out of Tampa International on Sunday, September, 17th to Durango, CO. I live in Sarasota, and just returned home the other day after evacuating for Hurricane Irma. I fled Florida and headed to Georgia, where I had to rent a hotel for a few nights. When I returned home I was fortunate enough not to have suffered damage. I of course have yard debris strewn about and I am still without power. The power company has estimated by the end of the day on September 22nd I will have power. With the extra costs incurred from having to leave my home, and the loss of power, I decided this was not a good time to travel."
Nick of Simpsonville, SC," Aug. 10, 2015","Hurricane Irma was mess for AA. I get it. I'm sure there were thousands who were stuck trying to get their flights changed. Unfortunately, I was in Costa Rica with a connection via Miami and I got, as the AA agent said ""the short end of the stick."" I would be stuck almost another week in Costa Rica as everything AA had was booked out or cancelled. I saw a little bit of silver lining when I found that if I could get to Mexico city, I could fly home via DFW. However, AA would not change the ticket as it is against their rules to change the country of origin on a ticket. ""We cannot do it."" However, a more accurate description is ""will not."""
Danilo of Marlborough, MA," Aug. 10, 2015","We were delayed on our AA out of Seattle due to having to wait on flight crew. Managed to make it to Dallas on time BUT had to sit on the tarmac for 20 mins waiting for a gait in order to deplane. This caused to miss our connecting flight. Next available flight is the next day. Asked about compensation for overnight hotel stay (there are 7 in our party, including a 3 year old) and were denied due to the delay being coded as weather related, which is absolutely bogus. So livid, frustrated, and tired at this point. Also found out AA has no number to call for complaints... You have to go through email so who knows if they will even read it or reply. Will never fly AA again if I can help it."
Erikka of Oakville, ON," Aug. 10, 2015","I was on an almost 2 hour flight (Flight AA3936) stuck sitting with one leg over my bag and the other on the edge of the aisle. Not once was I asked to check in my bag nor told it wouldn't fit on the overhead bin. By the time we landed my knees, hips and back were killing me and I had to have help from the gentleman next to me to be able to stand up. So glad there wasn't an emergency 'cause this would have been one hell of a hazard. Lesson learned not to use this airline again."
Victor of Las Vegas, NV," Aug. 10, 2015","American Airlines‰Û_the new standard for horrible service. Oh‰Û_I mean HORRIBLE! I travel very frequently for work and have stuck to one specific airline in order to build my status with them (ie. first class upgrades often, better seat choices, free checked bags). Recently, service has taken a turn for the worse. I‰Ûªm a reasonable guy and tolerate more than most. Call it my Southern hospitality, my upbringing or my service to the community when I served in law enforcement, but I just plain put up with more‰Û_until now."
Lori of Dedham, MA," Aug. 9, 2015","I travel 80%~ for Work and have flown with almost every airline multiple times. AA is by far the worst. Not due to their customer service/staff/delays or anything like that (at least that I‰Ûªve noticed), but their planes have no entertainment system on each seat, they do not play movies on the overhead screens, and they don‰Ûªt even have a free WiFi movie/tv option you can connect to using your phone! I‰Ûªm currently on a flight from Boston to Phoenix and was utterly shocked when I sat in my seat and noticed no form of entertainment for a cross-country flight. Delta and other airlines provide personal entertainment screens on each screen or a smartphone connect feature for 2+ hr flights, which in turn make the flights more enjoyable. Anyways, to avoid rambling on and on about the lack of technology on AA planes I‰Ûªll just say if you enjoyed traveling in the late 90s early 2000s, then AA is for you. If you want to travel in 2017 and beyond, find a different airline."

I, like many, had to cancel my trip because of hurricane Irma. I was informed by two customer service representatives that I would be able to rebook my flight to Miami with no additional charges in fare and no change fees. Of course, when it comes time to book my flight, I'm informed about a change fee. I told the agent, I was reassured twice that I would not be charged any additional fees because my initial cancellation was weather related. "
Adwoa of Newcastle , DE," Aug. 4, 2015","American Airlines is full of **. Our cruise was cancelled due to Hurricane Irma. It was beyond our control and the airline stated there was nothing that they could do. No partial credit, changes or anything! I will not be flying with them anymore!"
Paul of Garland, TX," Aug. 4, 2015",My husband and I were scheduled to fly out at 7:15 am to go to California for a very important family matter. We do not live near the airport so we were up early to make sure we were early and nothing could go wrong. But things did go wrong. When we got to the airport we went and printed out tickets at the self checkout. We did notice that it mentioned no overhead storage for our carry on bags. So confused because we fly a lot and there is always overhead storage or they place in under the cabin. So we asked a lady that was standing in the area of self print and she looked and our tickets said we would be fine... Again we were told wrong.
mark of San Diego, CA," Aug. 4, 2015","On September 4 my family of 5 arrived at the airport in Anchorage to fly home to Toronto via Dallas. Four of us had carry-on sized luggage but one had a mid-sized suitcase that we knew we would have to check. Our flight to Toronto included a 12.5-hour connection at DFW (not by choice). Since none of us sleep well on planes, we were considering going to a hotel following the overnight flight to DFW. When checking the suitcase, I specifically asked the American Airlines agent ""if we only check this bag to DFW and then go to a hotel for a few hours of sleep, will we be charged a second baggage fee to check the bag in for the flight to Toronto? If so we can rearrange the bags so that we can just check it through to Toronto."" "

When I was getting ready to board in Charlotte, the attendant mentioned that this was a new program for your airline and that customers have stated it was cost effective. However, this was not my case! I paid nearly $600 to fly from Columbus, OH to Asheville, NC. Absolutely absurd!!! In the future, I will do all I can to avoid flying with your airline and don't count on a positive recommendation from me to others! Also, stop charging for the first piece of checked in luggage!"

I called at night again because I was worried I saw it was still cancel. After almost 2 hours they answered the phone. I told them what happened. They told me that they were very sorry but the flight was canceled and they didnt' have flight for Sept 12. They gave me 1 stop flight for Sept 13. "
lynne of Philadelphia, PA," Aug. 3, 2015","I was scheduled to fly out of Tampa International on Sunday, September, 17th to Durango, CO. I live in Sarasota, and just returned home the other day after evacuating for Hurricane Irma. I fled Florida and headed to Georgia, where I had to rent a hotel for a few nights. When I returned home I was fortunate enough not to have suffered damage. I of course have yard debris strewn about and I am still without power. The power company has estimated by the end of the day on September 22nd I will have power. With the extra costs incurred from having to leave my home, and the loss of power, I decided this was not a good time to travel."
Inter of Coppell, TX," Aug. 3, 2015","Hurricane Irma was mess for AA. I get it. I'm sure there were thousands who were stuck trying to get their flights changed. Unfortunately, I was in Costa Rica with a connection via Miami and I got, as the AA agent said ""the short end of the stick."" I would be stuck almost another week in Costa Rica as everything AA had was booked out or cancelled. I saw a little bit of silver lining when I found that if I could get to Mexico city, I could fly home via DFW. However, AA would not change the ticket as it is against their rules to change the country of origin on a ticket. ""We cannot do it."" However, a more accurate description is ""will not."""
Emily of Philadelphia, PA," Aug. 2, 2015","We were delayed on our AA out of Seattle due to having to wait on flight crew. Managed to make it to Dallas on time BUT had to sit on the tarmac for 20 mins waiting for a gait in order to deplane. This caused to miss our connecting flight. Next available flight is the next day. Asked about compensation for overnight hotel stay (there are 7 in our party, including a 3 year old) and were denied due to the delay being coded as weather related, which is absolutely bogus. So livid, frustrated, and tired at this point. Also found out AA has no number to call for complaints... You have to go through email so who knows if they will even read it or reply. Will never fly AA again if I can help it."
Oliver of Dallas, TX," Aug. 2, 2015","I was on an almost 2 hour flight (Flight AA3936) stuck sitting with one leg over my bag and the other on the edge of the aisle. Not once was I asked to check in my bag nor told it wouldn't fit on the overhead bin. By the time we landed my knees, hips and back were killing me and I had to have help from the gentleman next to me to be able to stand up. So glad there wasn't an emergency 'cause this would have been one hell of a hazard. Lesson learned not to use this airline again."
david of Boise, ID," Aug. 1, 2015","American Airlines‰Û_the new standard for horrible service. Oh‰Û_I mean HORRIBLE! I travel very frequently for work and have stuck to one specific airline in order to build my status with them (ie. first class upgrades often, better seat choices, free checked bags). Recently, service has taken a turn for the worse. I‰Ûªm a reasonable guy and tolerate more than most. Call it my Southern hospitality, my upbringing or my service to the community when I served in law enforcement, but I just plain put up with more‰Û_until now."
Jack of Kansas City, MO," Aug. 1, 2015","I travel 80%~ for Work and have flown with almost every airline multiple times. AA is by far the worst. Not due to their customer service/staff/delays or anything like that (at least that I‰Ûªve noticed), but their planes have no entertainment system on each seat, they do not play movies on the overhead screens, and they don‰Ûªt even have a free WiFi movie/tv option you can connect to using your phone! I‰Ûªm currently on a flight from Boston to Phoenix and was utterly shocked when I sat in my seat and noticed no form of entertainment for a cross-country flight. Delta and other airlines provide personal entertainment screens on each screen or a smartphone connect feature for 2+ hr flights, which in turn make the flights more enjoyable. Anyways, to avoid rambling on and on about the lack of technology on AA planes I‰Ûªll just say if you enjoyed traveling in the late 90s early 2000s, then AA is for you. If you want to travel in 2017 and beyond, find a different airline."
Elizabeth of Lakeville, MA," Aug. 1, 2015","I had a horrible experience today on my flight back to Miami. I have been an AAdvantage member for many years now and have always chosen to be loyal to American but after today's experience that may change. The onboarding process was fine and the flight was on time, which to be honest is rare but I was happy. When the snacks and beverage cart came the attendant did not smile, looked unhappy to take our beverage order, handed me and my husband 2 cookies, I then I told her, ""Can we just get pretzels?"" She said ""Then I need the cookies back."" I was honestly appalled."
yvette of Cypress, CA," Aug. 1, 2015","Don't deserve single star. Also, I have a flight from Chicago to Minneapolis 5 hours from now. And they have seats available on the earlier flight but won't give you without charging $75. They are ok to make you wait or fly a flight with empty seats but no customer delight which is no cost to them. No customer driven company and not looking for going extra mile to make customer happy. Never travel on American Airlines again."
Darby of Lexington, KY," Aug. 1, 2015","Worst experience ever with AA never again, they treated my dad like garbage, they humiliated my dad in front of my niece travelling with him and in front of all passengers, just because my dad is ** and not fluent in English. I wish I could sue them for discrimination against my dad for not speaking English fluent instead of offering assistance in Spanish which, the sky harbor airport in Arizona has plenty of bilingual employees. DO NOT FLY AA EVER, pay more with a different airline. The only reason why my dad and niece flew AA to go to my brother's funeral, thank you AA for the worst day ever. It's a shame I have to put a star instead of no stars service."
Rupasingha of North Bethesda, MD," July 31, 2015","This American Airlines review is out of frustration due to a lot of things. They're a disgrace! The employees are rude, there is no leg room, no entertainment, and treat people like herds of sheep. They have a ""New"" rule where they charge $50 at the gate to carry on your luggage. Are you kidding me? $50 for a carry on? And I can't even use the overhead bin! Disgraceful! Basically these guys are crooks! They're a disgrace. Last time I flew with American their flight was delayed by 2 hours and we ended up missing our connecting flight because it was the last flight out. We ended up having to stay an extra day and had to pay $100 for a hotel. We missed my sisters wedding. On the way back we ended up stuck on the tarmac for 2 hours. Of course!"
Terrell of Provo, UT," July 31, 2015","I booked a ticket back when the hurricane were hitting down south every other week. Because of that I was not able to attend my trip in GA. They told me I had up to a year to use my ticket. So when I try to rebook my ticket they are now close to $500. Mind you this is the highest rate out of all the airlines for my particular dates, I asked for a refund because I didn't wanna double what I paid the first time and I was told by the Supervisor (Willie ** in Dallas ) that my only option was to ""use it or lost it"". Being a supervisor myself I thought the tone in which he said it was very careless and he didn't try to help the situation at all. I would never talk to my customers the way he spoke to me especially after losing out on $300!!"
Douglas of Greenacres, FL," July 30, 2015","I just completed a flight on American Airlines. I had read negative reviews, but I found the American Airlines people I had contact with were great, tried to provide all the service they could because our flight had been cancelled due WX and had to layover at ORD. My complaint is the phoney coupon given for a hotel room for a ""discounted rate"". The coupon has nothing to do with American Airlines, but is only a hotel booking service. When I called the phone number provided I was told the only available room was 10 miles away and given a rate of $80.00. It was getting late in the evening so took it. Then was advised there was a $15 service charge to book the room. American Airline paid none of this. The shuttle bus to the hotel was packed (Other delayed passengers). When I got home I checked the hotel rate and found the same room went for $105. I ""saved"" $10. The hotel was a Holiday Inn Express. Room not bad."

She made up some baloney about Homeland Security not letting people fly with spots on their passport. I told her I checked their website and there was no mention of anything like that. She then claimed, ""Oh, they don't tell you."" I said, ""Then how are you supposed to know?""

While I was away, I heard the news that my dad had passed away. In which, I contacted American Airlines right away and asked if anything can be done. I wanted to fly back before my actual trip date, due to obvious reasons. I even offered to provide them with a death certificate if need be (although, I don't think that is even something they should ask for right away). I spoke to 3 different customer service reps who were all horrible to speak with. They had zero compassion and empathy and just dismissed me as if what I was experiencing was far from a big deal to them. "
Nh of Athens, GA," July 30, 2015","I was on the plane for 14 hours due to a delay. Sitting in a broken seat that would not recline. I told the stewardess and she could care less, said nothing she can do. After I got home I contacted the airline and they issued me a fourteen dollar credit. I had paid 197.34 dollars for preferred seats. The worst flight of my life, never again w/ this airline."
anne of Dover, NH," July 29, 2015","Overall, (Un)American Airlines continues to disappoint. I really only ever fly with AA as a last resort, and I can't see any reason to recommend traveling with AA. I was prior active duty Army, and now I'm a reservist, and only American Airlines makes me feel like my service is less important now. United, Southwest, Jet Blue, Delta, every other airline doesn't discriminate between Active Duty and Reserve/Guardsmen when it comes to bag fees. So, along with uncomfortable, outdated planes and poor service, I spent a $100 checking bags to and from my destination."
Jessica of Waterford, NY," July 28, 2015",American Airlines is the worst airlines to fly anywhere. They cram you in the seats with no leg room or any room for that matter. I requested a wheelchair at airport and waited 30 minutes upon someone finally arriving. They took me the wrong way to my next check in and I missed my flight. They said I would have to rebook my ticket and just wait for the next flight. Attendant at the gate was very disrespectful and not helpful at all. I had no control over this situation at all. Not to mention when I did finally arrive at my destination that I requested a wheelchair prior to my departure.
kimberley of Rio Claro, Other," July 28, 2015","American Airlines is the worst airline in THE WORLD, and should change their name, it is utterly disgraceful that as an American they use this name. Their policy is to not apologize for anything, to be as rude as possible to people who are basically held hostage to them and their BS policies like closing the door to the gate while people are standing there then charging them money to rebook their flight, not caring at all about the bags on their way to a destination without the owners there to pick them up. Then being told when lodging a complaint that it was going in one ear and out the other. I have never been treated so poorly in my life, I will never again fly with this airline, I hope they go bankrupt and get the worst karma life can give. Oh yeah and I get to fly with them tomorrow. :/"
Breindy of Brooklyn, NY," July 28, 2015","Very disappointed. Unlikely I will ever choose American Airlines again. I didn't make my flight in the spring. I was given a voucher to use for future travel. Now I'm being told I can only use it myself, and not for my family. I don't want to use it for myself. What difference does it make? I'm being told different things by different people. The last guy hung up on me and I wasn't even rude to him. This is how AA does business? All I want is to not be penalized for cancelling a flight that was beyond my control. If you have a voucher it should be flexible to use for anyone. AA is the WORST! Hope they go out of business for this nonsense. Airline travel is a joke."
TWEET of Los Angeles, CA," July 28, 2015","American Airlines canceled my 92-year-old father-in-law's flight to Key West due to Hurricane Irma. On that day American Airline was contacted and the representative said there would be no problem re-booking, just use the reference number. American Airlines even went on TV and said they would waive re-booking fees. Today when calling to re-book the flight and after 57 minutes on the phone, I was told the flight could not be re-booked because it was in their notes I requested a refund. At no time did I request a refund and American Airlines could not locate any record of a refund request. Even so, American Airlines still insisted they could not re-book the flight or issue a refund. If we did not have enough trouble dealing with a Cat 4 hurricane and its devastating aftermath, now American Airlines is adding to the misery. All my father-in-law wants is to come to Key West and see that everyone is alright. Thanks, AA."
jackie of Kirkwood, MO," July 28, 2015",I bought tickets for my mother in law and son to meet my wife and I in Colorado. We had traveled on different airlines due to connections and therefore were going back on different airlines. My wife and I left on our airplane. My mother in law and son were stranded as the plane had a mechanical. This was 8 AM and the bottom line was it didn't get fixed that day. American gave them a 12.00 voucher good in the terminal and did nothing to get them a room as the rooms they usually used weren't available.
Mysty of Beckley, WV," July 27, 2015","I booked 2 separate flights on American Airlines in Economy since I pay for my air travel. On one they pre-assigned me a back-of-plane middle seat and said that I was required to pay some increased fee for window, aisle or closer to the front. On the second flight they said I have to wait until I reach the boarding gate for any seat. This is ridiculous and unacceptable. The airline has sufficient revenue to - just a suggestion - increase the ""base"" fare to cover a first-come-first-served seat selection and not put everyone into 3rd class or worse status. If they want to surcharge certain premium seats, like middle seats toward the front, that's OK, but this behavior is totally unacceptable and I refuse to fly them (or any airline) that abuses their passengers."

When I got home I checked the hotel rate and found the same room went for $105. I ""saved"" $10. The hotel was a Holiday Inn Express. Room not bad."

She then claimed, ""Oh, they don't tell you."" I said, ""Then how are you supposed to know?""

I wanted to fly back before my actual trip date, due to obvious reasons. I even offered to provide them with a death certificate if need be (although, I don't think that is even something they should ask for right away). I spoke to 3 different customer service reps who were all horrible to speak with. They had zero compassion and empathy and just dismissed me as if what I was experiencing was far from a big deal to them. "
dale of Scottsdale, AZ," July 17, 2015","I was on the plane for 14 hours due to a delay. Sitting in a broken seat that would not recline. I told the stewardess and she could care less, said nothing she can do. After I got home I contacted the airline and they issued me a fourteen dollar credit. I had paid 197.34 dollars for preferred seats. The worst flight of my life, never again w/ this airline."
Michael of Cheshire, CT," July 17, 2015","Overall, (Un)American Airlines continues to disappoint. I really only ever fly with AA as a last resort, and I can't see any reason to recommend traveling with AA. I was prior active duty Army, and now I'm a reservist, and only American Airlines makes me feel like my service is less important now. United, Southwest, Jet Blue, Delta, every other airline doesn't discriminate between Active Duty and Reserve/Guardsmen when it comes to bag fees. So, along with uncomfortable, outdated planes and poor service, I spent a $100 checking bags to and from my destination."
Dan of Arlington, TX," July 16, 2015",American Airlines is the worst airlines to fly anywhere. They cram you in the seats with no leg room or any room for that matter. I requested a wheelchair at airport and waited 30 minutes upon someone finally arriving. They took me the wrong way to my next check in and I missed my flight. They said I would have to rebook my ticket and just wait for the next flight. Attendant at the gate was very disrespectful and not helpful at all. I had no control over this situation at all. Not to mention when I did finally arrive at my destination that I requested a wheelchair prior to my departure.
Tony of Newport News, VA," July 16, 2015","American Airlines is the worst airline in THE WORLD, and should change their name, it is utterly disgraceful that as an American they use this name. Their policy is to not apologize for anything, to be as rude as possible to people who are basically held hostage to them and their BS policies like closing the door to the gate while people are standing there then charging them money to rebook their flight, not caring at all about the bags on their way to a destination without the owners there to pick them up. Then being told when lodging a complaint that it was going in one ear and out the other. I have never been treated so poorly in my life, I will never again fly with this airline, I hope they go bankrupt and get the worst karma life can give. Oh yeah and I get to fly with them tomorrow. :/"
christine of Merrick, NY," July 16, 2015","Very disappointed. Unlikely I will ever choose American Airlines again. I didn't make my flight in the spring. I was given a voucher to use for future travel. Now I'm being told I can only use it myself, and not for my family. I don't want to use it for myself. What difference does it make? I'm being told different things by different people. The last guy hung up on me and I wasn't even rude to him. This is how AA does business? All I want is to not be penalized for cancelling a flight that was beyond my control. If you have a voucher it should be flexible to use for anyone. AA is the WORST! Hope they go out of business for this nonsense. Airline travel is a joke."
Daniel of Bremerton, WA," July 15, 2015","American Airlines canceled my 92-year-old father-in-law's flight to Key West due to Hurricane Irma. On that day American Airline was contacted and the representative said there would be no problem re-booking, just use the reference number. American Airlines even went on TV and said they would waive re-booking fees. Today when calling to re-book the flight and after 57 minutes on the phone, I was told the flight could not be re-booked because it was in their notes I requested a refund. At no time did I request a refund and American Airlines could not locate any record of a refund request. Even so, American Airlines still insisted they could not re-book the flight or issue a refund. If we did not have enough trouble dealing with a Cat 4 hurricane and its devastating aftermath, now American Airlines is adding to the misery. All my father-in-law wants is to come to Key West and see that everyone is alright. Thanks, AA."
Elizabeth of Norfolk, VA," July 15, 2015",I bought tickets for my mother in law and son to meet my wife and I in Colorado. We had traveled on different airlines due to connections and therefore were going back on different airlines. My wife and I left on our airplane. My mother in law and son were stranded as the plane had a mechanical. This was 8 AM and the bottom line was it didn't get fixed that day. American gave them a 12.00 voucher good in the terminal and did nothing to get them a room as the rooms they usually used weren't available.
Luis of Gambrills, MD," July 15, 2015","I booked 2 separate flights on American Airlines in Economy since I pay for my air travel. On one they pre-assigned me a back-of-plane middle seat and said that I was required to pay some increased fee for window, aisle or closer to the front. On the second flight they said I have to wait until I reach the boarding gate for any seat. This is ridiculous and unacceptable. The airline has sufficient revenue to - just a suggestion - increase the ""base"" fare to cover a first-come-first-served seat selection and not put everyone into 3rd class or worse status. If they want to surcharge certain premium seats, like middle seats toward the front, that's OK, but this behavior is totally unacceptable and I refuse to fly them (or any airline) that abuses their passengers."
brett of Sierra Madre, CA," July 15, 2015",Well I looked into changing my flight for my fiance and I to go home a day earlier... only to discover that American charges $200.00 a ticket PLUS the difference in price tickets! LIKE THAT IS GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE! So for the price of another ticket I can change my flight! I will be looking elsewhere for flights in the future. I have already paid for a flight and now you are trying to rip me off even more!?! Out of touch and terrible service to a customer of over 5 years. I will be going elsewhere where I don't get bent over the table. Thank you American!

I was informed by two customer service representatives that I would be able to rebook my flight to Miami with no additional charges in fare and no change fees. Of course, when it comes time to book my flight, I'm informed about a change fee. I told the agent, I was reassured twice that I would not be charged any additional fees because my initial cancellation was weather related. "

joy of Lascassas, TN," July 14, 2015",My husband and I were scheduled to fly out at 7:15 am to go to California for a very important family matter. We do not live near the airport so we were up early to make sure we were early and nothing could go wrong. But things did go wrong. When we got to the airport we went and printed out tickets at the self checkout. We did notice that it mentioned no overhead storage for our carry on bags. So confused because we fly a lot and there is always overhead storage or they place in under the cabin. So we asked a lady that was standing in the area of self print and she looked and our tickets said we would be fine... Again we were told wrong.
Sara Jane of Glenmoore, PA," July 14, 2015","On September 4 my family of 5 arrived at the airport in Anchorage to fly home to Toronto via Dallas. Four of us had carry-on sized luggage but one had a mid-sized suitcase that we knew we would have to check. Our flight to Toronto included a 12.5-hour connection at DFW (not by choice). Since none of us sleep well on planes, we were considering going to a hotel following the overnight flight to DFW. When checking the suitcase, I specifically asked the American Airlines agent ""if we only check this bag to DFW and then go to a hotel for a few hours of sleep, will we be charged a second baggage fee to check the bag in for the flight to Toronto? If so we can rearrange the bags so that we can just check it through to Toronto."" "

In the future, I will do all I can to avoid flying with your airline and don't count on a positive recommendation from me to others! Also, stop charging for the first piece of checked in luggage!"

Greg of Lenexa, KS," July 13, 2015","I was scheduled to fly out of Tampa International on Sunday, September, 17th to Durango, CO. I live in Sarasota, and just returned home the other day after evacuating for Hurricane Irma. I fled Florida and headed to Georgia, where I had to rent a hotel for a few nights. When I returned home I was fortunate enough not to have suffered damage. I of course have yard debris strewn about and I am still without power. The power company has estimated by the end of the day on September 22nd I will have power. With the extra costs incurred from having to leave my home, and the loss of power, I decided this was not a good time to travel."
Ashley of Springfield, OR," July 12, 2015","Hurricane Irma was mess for AA. I get it. I'm sure there were thousands who were stuck trying to get their flights changed. Unfortunately, I was in Costa Rica with a connection via Miami and I got, as the AA agent said ""the short end of the stick."" I would be stuck almost another week in Costa Rica as everything AA had was booked out or cancelled. I saw a little bit of silver lining when I found that if I could get to Mexico city, I could fly home via DFW. However, AA would not change the ticket as it is against their rules to change the country of origin on a ticket. ""We cannot do it."" However, a more accurate description is ""will not."""
Gary of College Station, TX," July 10, 2015","We were delayed on our AA out of Seattle due to having to wait on flight crew. Managed to make it to Dallas on time BUT had to sit on the tarmac for 20 mins waiting for a gait in order to deplane. This caused to miss our connecting flight. Next available flight is the next day. Asked about compensation for overnight hotel stay (there are 7 in our party, including a 3 year old) and were denied due to the delay being coded as weather related, which is absolutely bogus. So livid, frustrated, and tired at this point. Also found out AA has no number to call for complaints... You have to go through email so who knows if they will even read it or reply. Will never fly AA again if I can help it."
Larry of Agoura Hills, CA," July 9, 2015","I was on an almost 2 hour flight (Flight AA3936) stuck sitting with one leg over my bag and the other on the edge of the aisle. Not once was I asked to check in my bag nor told it wouldn't fit on the overhead bin. By the time we landed my knees, hips and back were killing me and I had to have help from the gentleman next to me to be able to stand up. So glad there wasn't an emergency 'cause this would have been one hell of a hazard. Lesson learned not to use this airline again."
Scott of Tampa, FL," July 9, 2015","American Airlines‰Û_the new standard for horrible service. Oh‰Û_I mean HORRIBLE! I travel very frequently for work and have stuck to one specific airline in order to build my status with them (ie. first class upgrades often, better seat choices, free checked bags). Recently, service has taken a turn for the worse. I‰Ûªm a reasonable guy and tolerate more than most. Call it my Southern hospitality, my upbringing or my service to the community when I served in law enforcement, but I just plain put up with more‰Û_until now."
Ceylon of Mt Gretna, PA," July 9, 2015","I travel 80%~ for Work and have flown with almost every airline multiple times. AA is by far the worst. Not due to their customer service/staff/delays or anything like that (at least that I‰Ûªve noticed), but their planes have no entertainment system on each seat, they do not play movies on the overhead screens, and they don‰Ûªt even have a free WiFi movie/tv option you can connect to using your phone! I‰Ûªm currently on a flight from Boston to Phoenix and was utterly shocked when I sat in my seat and noticed no form of entertainment for a cross-country flight. Delta and other airlines provide personal entertainment screens on each screen or a smartphone connect feature for 2+ hr flights, which in turn make the flights more enjoyable. Anyways, to avoid rambling on and on about the lack of technology on AA planes I‰Ûªll just say if you enjoyed traveling in the late 90s early 2000s, then AA is for you. If you want to travel in 2017 and beyond, find a different airline."
Florence of Tucson, AZ," July 9, 2015","I had a horrible experience today on my flight back to Miami. I have been an AAdvantage member for many years now and have always chosen to be loyal to American but after today's experience that may change. The onboarding process was fine and the flight was on time, which to be honest is rare but I was happy. When the snacks and beverage cart came the attendant did not smile, looked unhappy to take our beverage order, handed me and my husband 2 cookies, I then I told her, ""Can we just get pretzels?"" She said ""Then I need the cookies back."" I was honestly appalled."
Cathy of Ellijay , GA," July 9, 2015","Don't deserve single star. Also, I have a flight from Chicago to Minneapolis 5 hours from now. And they have seats available on the earlier flight but won't give you without charging $75. They are ok to make you wait or fly a flight with empty seats but no customer delight which is no cost to them. No customer driven company and not looking for going extra mile to make customer happy. Never travel on American Airlines again."
Juan of Phoenix, AZ," July 9, 2015","Worst experience ever with AA never again, they treated my dad like garbage, they humiliated my dad in front of my niece travelling with him and in front of all passengers, just because my dad is ** and not fluent in English. I wish I could sue them for discrimination against my dad for not speaking English fluent instead of offering assistance in Spanish which, the sky harbor airport in Arizona has plenty of bilingual employees. DO NOT FLY AA EVER, pay more with a different airline. The only reason why my dad and niece flew AA to go to my brother's funeral, thank you AA for the worst day ever. It's a shame I have to put a star instead of no stars service."
melissa of Allen, TX," July 8, 2015","This American Airlines review is out of frustration due to a lot of things. They're a disgrace! The employees are rude, there is no leg room, no entertainment, and treat people like herds of sheep. They have a ""New"" rule where they charge $50 at the gate to carry on your luggage. Are you kidding me? $50 for a carry on? And I can't even use the overhead bin! Disgraceful! Basically these guys are crooks! They're a disgrace. Last time I flew with American their flight was delayed by 2 hours and we ended up missing our connecting flight because it was the last flight out. We ended up having to stay an extra day and had to pay $100 for a hotel. We missed my sisters wedding. On the way back we ended up stuck on the tarmac for 2 hours. Of course!"
Mikaella of Aurora, CO," July 7, 2015","I booked a ticket back when the hurricane were hitting down south every other week. Because of that I was not able to attend my trip in GA.

Mind you this is the highest rate out of all the airlines for my particular dates, I asked for a refund because I didn't wanna double what I paid the first time and I was told by the Supervisor (Willie ** in Dallas ) that my only option was to ""use it or lost it"". Being a supervisor myself I thought the tone in which he said it was very careless and he didn't try to help the situation at all.

I live in Sarasota, and just returned home the other day after evacuating for Hurricane Irma. I fled Florida and headed to Georgia, where I had to rent a hotel for a few nights. When I returned home I was fortunate enough not to have suffered damage. I of course have yard debris strewn about and I am still without power. The power company has estimated by the end of the day on September 22nd I will have power. With the extra costs incurred from having to leave my home, and the loss of power, I decided this was not a good time to travel."
Michael of Houston , TX," June 29, 2015","Hurricane Irma was mess for AA. I get it. I'm sure there were thousands who were stuck trying to get their flights changed. Unfortunately, I was in Costa Rica with a connection via Miami and I got, as the AA agent said ""the short end of the stick."" I would be stuck almost another week in Costa Rica as everything AA had was booked out or cancelled. I saw a little bit of silver lining when I found that if I could get to Mexico city, I could fly home via DFW. However, AA would not change the ticket as it is against their rules to change the country of origin on a ticket. ""We cannot do it."" However, a more accurate description is ""will not."""
yifat of La Jolla, CA," June 29, 2015","We were delayed on our AA out of Seattle due to having to wait on flight crew. Managed to make it to Dallas on time BUT had to sit on the tarmac for 20 mins waiting for a gait in order to deplane. This caused to miss our connecting flight. Next available flight is the next day. Asked about compensation for overnight hotel stay (there are 7 in our party, including a 3 year old) and were denied due to the delay being coded as weather related, which is absolutely bogus. So livid, frustrated, and tired at this point. Also found out AA has no number to call for complaints... You have to go through email so who knows if they will even read it or reply. Will never fly AA again if I can help it."
Don of Cranberry Twp, PA," June 29, 2015","I was on an almost 2 hour flight (Flight AA3936) stuck sitting with one leg over my bag and the other on the edge of the aisle. Not once was I asked to check in my bag nor told it wouldn't fit on the overhead bin. By the time we landed my knees, hips and back were killing me and I had to have help from the gentleman next to me to be able to stand up. So glad there wasn't an emergency 'cause this would have been one hell of a hazard. Lesson learned not to use this airline again."
Hannah of Corydon, IN," June 28, 2015","American Airlines‰Û_the new standard for horrible service. Oh‰Û_I mean HORRIBLE! I travel very frequently for work and have stuck to one specific airline in order to build my status with them (ie. first class upgrades often, better seat choices, free checked bags). Recently, service has taken a turn for the worse. I‰Ûªm a reasonable guy and tolerate more than most. Call it my Southern hospitality, my upbringing or my service to the community when I served in law enforcement, but I just plain put up with more‰Û_until now."
Anatoli of Flushing, NY," June 28, 2015","I travel 80%~ for Work and have flown with almost every airline multiple times. AA is by far the worst. Not due to their customer service/staff/delays or anything like that (at least that I‰Ûªve noticed), but their planes have no entertainment system on each seat, they do not play movies on the overhead screens, and they don‰Ûªt even have a free WiFi movie/tv option you can connect to using your phone! I‰Ûªm currently on a flight from Boston to Phoenix and was utterly shocked when I sat in my seat and noticed no form of entertainment for a cross-country flight. Delta and other airlines provide personal entertainment screens on each screen or a smartphone connect feature for 2+ hr flights, which in turn make the flights more enjoyable. Anyways, to avoid rambling on and on about the lack of technology on AA planes I‰Ûªll just say if you enjoyed traveling in the late 90s early 2000s, then AA is for you. If you want to travel in 2017 and beyond, find a different airline."
Rick of Keansburg, NJ," June 28, 2015","I had a horrible experience today on my flight back to Miami. I have been an AAdvantage member for many years now and have always chosen to be loyal to American but after today's experience that may change. The onboarding process was fine and the flight was on time, which to be honest is rare but I was happy. When the snacks and beverage cart came the attendant did not smile, looked unhappy to take our beverage order, handed me and my husband 2 cookies, I then I told her, ""Can we just get pretzels?"" She said ""Then I need the cookies back."" I was honestly appalled."
Sergey of New York, NY," June 27, 2015","Don't deserve single star. Also, I have a flight from Chicago to Minneapolis 5 hours from now. And they have seats available on the earlier flight but won't give you without charging $75. They are ok to make you wait or fly a flight with empty seats but no customer delight which is no cost to them. No customer driven company and not looking for going extra mile to make customer happy. Never travel on American Airlines again."
Ashley of Hudson, NC," June 27, 2015","Worst experience ever with AA never again, they treated my dad like garbage, they humiliated my dad in front of my niece travelling with him and in front of all passengers, just because my dad is ** and not fluent in English. I wish I could sue them for discrimination against my dad for not speaking English fluent instead of offering assistance in Spanish which, the sky harbor airport in Arizona has plenty of bilingual employees. DO NOT FLY AA EVER, pay more with a different airline. The only reason why my dad and niece flew AA to go to my brother's funeral, thank you AA for the worst day ever. It's a shame I have to put a star instead of no stars service."

Are you kidding me? $50 for a carry on? And I can't even use the overhead bin! Disgraceful! Basically these guys are crooks! They're a disgrace. Last time I flew with American their flight was delayed by 2 hours and we ended up missing our connecting flight because it was the last flight out. We ended up having to stay an extra day and had to pay $100 for a hotel. We missed my sisters wedding. On the way back we ended up stuck on the tarmac for 2 hours. Of course!"
Maria of Wichita, KS," June 27, 2015","I booked a ticket back when the hurricane were hitting down south every other week. Because of that I was not able to attend my trip in GA.

Mind you this is the highest rate out of all the airlines for my particular dates, I asked for a refund because I didn't wanna double what I paid the first time and I was told by the Supervisor (Willie ** in Dallas ) that my only option was to ""use it or lost it"". Being a supervisor myself I thought the tone in which he said it was very careless and he didn't try to help the situation at all. I would never talk to my customers the way he spoke to me especially after losing out on $300!!"
Chris of Plainsboro, NJ," June 27, 2015","I just completed a flight on American Airlines. I had read negative reviews, but I found the American Airlines people I had contact with were great, tried to provide all the service they could because our flight had been cancelled due WX and had to layover at ORD. My complaint is the phoney coupon given for a hotel room for a ""discounted rate"". The coupon has nothing to do with American Airlines, but is only a hotel booking service. When I called the phone number provided I was told the only available room was 10 miles away and given a rate of $80.00. It was getting late in the evening so took it. Then was advised there was a $15 service charge to book the room. American Airline paid none of this. The shuttle bus to the hotel was packed (Other delayed passengers). When I got home I checked the hotel rate and found the same room went for $105. I ""saved"" $10. The hotel was a Holiday Inn Express. Room not bad."

I wanted to fly back before my actual trip date, due to obvious reasons. I even offered to provide them with a death certificate if need be (although, I don't think that is even something they should ask for right away). I spoke to 3 different customer service reps who were all horrible to speak with.

Jessica of Everett, WA," June 25, 2015","Overall, (Un)American Airlines continues to disappoint. I really only ever fly with AA as a last resort, and I can't see any reason to recommend traveling with AA. I was prior active duty Army, and now I'm a reservist, and only American Airlines makes me feel like my service is less important now. United, Southwest, Jet Blue, Delta, every other airline doesn't discriminate between Active Duty and Reserve/Guardsmen when it comes to bag fees. So, along with uncomfortable, outdated planes and poor service, I spent a $100 checking bags to and from my destination."
Sandra of Oakland, CA," June 25, 2015",American Airlines is the worst airlines to fly anywhere. They cram you in the seats with no leg room or any room for that matter. I requested a wheelchair at airport and waited 30 minutes upon someone finally arriving. They took me the wrong way to my next check in and I missed my flight. They said I would have to rebook my ticket and just wait for the next flight. Attendant at the gate was very disrespectful and not helpful at all. I had no control over this situation at all. Not to mention when I did finally arrive at my destination that I requested a wheelchair prior to my departure.
Matt of Austin, TX," June 25, 2015","American Airlines is the worst airline in THE WORLD, and should change their name, it is utterly disgraceful that as an American they use this name. Their policy is to not apologize for anything, to be as rude as possible to people who are basically held hostage to them and their BS policies like closing the door to the gate while people are standing there then charging them money to rebook their flight, not caring at all about the bags on their way to a destination without the owners there to pick them up. Then being told when lodging a complaint that it was going in one ear and out the other. I have never been treated so poorly in my life, I will never again fly with this airline, I hope they go bankrupt and get the worst karma life can give. Oh yeah and I get to fly with them tomorrow. :/"
J. of Manassas, VA," June 24, 2015","Very disappointed. Unlikely I will ever choose American Airlines again. I didn't make my flight in the spring. I was given a voucher to use for future travel. Now I'm being told I can only use it myself, and not for my family. I don't want to use it for myself. What difference does it make? I'm being told different things by different people. The last guy hung up on me and I wasn't even rude to him. This is how AA does business? All I want is to not be penalized for cancelling a flight that was beyond my control. If you have a voucher it should be flexible to use for anyone. AA is the WORST! Hope they go out of business for this nonsense. Airline travel is a joke."
Grace of Beverly Hills , CA," June 24, 2015","American Airlines canceled my 92-year-old father-in-law's flight to Key West due to Hurricane Irma. On that day American Airline was contacted and the representative said there would be no problem re-booking, just use the reference number. American Airlines even went on TV and said they would waive re-booking fees. Today when calling to re-book the flight and after 57 minutes on the phone, I was told the flight could not be re-booked because it was in their notes I requested a refund. At no time did I request a refund and American Airlines could not locate any record of a refund request. Even so, American Airlines still insisted they could not re-book the flight or issue a refund. If we did not have enough trouble dealing with a Cat 4 hurricane and its devastating aftermath, now American Airlines is adding to the misery. All my father-in-law wants is to come to Key West and see that everyone is alright. Thanks, AA."
Yiting of Singapore, Other," June 23, 2015",I bought tickets for my mother in law and son to meet my wife and I in Colorado. We had traveled on different airlines due to connections and therefore were going back on different airlines. My wife and I left on our airplane. My mother in law and son were stranded as the plane had a mechanical. This was 8 AM and the bottom line was it didn't get fixed that day. American gave them a 12.00 voucher good in the terminal and did nothing to get them a room as the rooms they usually used weren't available.
Deanna of Rancho Cucamonga, CA," June 23, 2015","I booked 2 separate flights on American Airlines in Economy since I pay for my air travel. On one they pre-assigned me a back-of-plane middle seat and said that I was required to pay some increased fee for window, aisle or closer to the front. On the second flight they said I have to wait until I reach the boarding gate for any seat. This is ridiculous and unacceptable. The airline has sufficient revenue to - just a suggestion - increase the ""base"" fare to cover a first-come-first-served seat selection and not put everyone into 3rd class or worse status. If they want to surcharge certain premium seats, like middle seats toward the front, that's OK, but this behavior is totally unacceptable and I refuse to fly them (or any airline) that abuses their passengers."
Melba of Phoenix, AZ," June 23, 2015",Well I looked into changing my flight for my fiance and I to go home a day earlier... only to discover that American charges $200.00 a ticket PLUS the difference in price tickets!

I have already paid for a flight and now you are trying to rip me off even more!?! Out of touch and terrible service to a customer of over 5 years.

David of Mount Pleasant, SC," June 22, 2015",My husband and I were scheduled to fly out at 7:15 am to go to California for a very important family matter. We do not live near the airport so we were up early to make sure we were early and nothing could go wrong. But things did go wrong. When we got to the airport we went and printed out tickets at the self checkout. We did notice that it mentioned no overhead storage for our carry on bags. So confused because we fly a lot and there is always overhead storage or they place in under the cabin. So we asked a lady that was standing in the area of self print and she looked and our tickets said we would be fine... Again we were told wrong.
Ida of Bend, OR," June 22, 2015","On September 4 my family of 5 arrived at the airport in Anchorage to fly home to Toronto via Dallas. Four of us had carry-on sized luggage but one had a mid-sized suitcase that we knew we would have to check. Our flight to Toronto included a 12.5-hour connection at DFW (not by choice). Since none of us sleep well on planes, we were considering going to a hotel following the overnight flight to DFW. When checking the suitcase, I specifically asked the American Airlines agent ""if we only check this bag to DFW and then go to a hotel for a few hours of sleep, will we be charged a second baggage fee to check the bag in for the flight to Toronto? If so we can rearrange the bags so that we can just check it through to Toronto."" "

They said I would have to rebook my ticket and just wait for the next flight. Attendant at the gate was very disrespectful and not helpful at all. I had no control over this situation at all. Not to mention when I did finally arrive at my destination that I requested a wheelchair prior to my departure.
Victoria of San Jose, CA," June 16, 2015","American Airlines is the worst airline in THE WORLD, and should change their name, it is utterly disgraceful that as an American they use this name. Their policy is to not apologize for anything, to be as rude as possible to people who are basically held hostage to them and their BS policies like closing the door to the gate while people are standing there then charging them money to rebook their flight, not caring at all about the bags on their way to a destination without the owners there to pick them up. Then being told when lodging a complaint that it was going in one ear and out the other. I have never been treated so poorly in my life, I will never again fly with this airline, I hope they go bankrupt and get the worst karma life can give. Oh yeah and I get to fly with them tomorrow. :/"
Scott of Washington, DC," June 16, 2015","Very disappointed. Unlikely I will ever choose American Airlines again. I didn't make my flight in the spring. I was given a voucher to use for future travel. Now I'm being told I can only use it myself, and not for my family. I don't want to use it for myself. What difference does it make? I'm being told different things by different people. The last guy hung up on me and I wasn't even rude to him. This is how AA does business? All I want is to not be penalized for cancelling a flight that was beyond my control. If you have a voucher it should be flexible to use for anyone. AA is the WORST! Hope they go out of business for this nonsense. Airline travel is a joke."
Cheryl of San Jose, CA," June 16, 2015","American Airlines canceled my 92-year-old father-in-law's flight to Key West due to Hurricane Irma. On that day American Airline was contacted and the representative said there would be no problem re-booking, just use the reference number. American Airlines even went on TV and said they would waive re-booking fees. Today when calling to re-book the flight and after 57 minutes on the phone, I was told the flight could not be re-booked because it was in their notes I requested a refund. At no time did I request a refund and American Airlines could not locate any record of a refund request. Even so, American Airlines still insisted they could not re-book the flight or issue a refund. If we did not have enough trouble dealing with a Cat 4 hurricane and its devastating aftermath, now American Airlines is adding to the misery. All my father-in-law wants is to come to Key West and see that everyone is alright. Thanks, AA."
Tom of Destin, FL," June 16, 2015",I bought tickets for my mother in law and son to meet my wife and I in Colorado. We had traveled on different airlines due to connections and therefore were going back on different airlines. My wife and I left on our airplane. My mother in law and son were stranded as the plane had a mechanical. This was 8 AM and the bottom line was it didn't get fixed that day. American gave them a 12.00 voucher good in the terminal and did nothing to get them a room as the rooms they usually used weren't available.
Melisa of Bardstown, KY," June 16, 2015","I booked 2 separate flights on American Airlines in Economy since I pay for my air travel. On one they pre-assigned me a back-of-plane middle seat and said that I was required to pay some increased fee for window, aisle or closer to the front. On the second flight they said I have to wait until I reach the boarding gate for any seat. This is ridiculous and unacceptable. The airline has sufficient revenue to - just a suggestion - increase the ""base"" fare to cover a first-come-first-served seat selection and not put everyone into 3rd class or worse status. If they want to surcharge certain premium seats, like middle seats toward the front, that's OK, but this behavior is totally unacceptable and I refuse to fly them (or any airline) that abuses their passengers."
Alexander of Mason, OH," June 15, 2015",Well I looked into changing my flight for my fiance and I to go home a day earlier... only to discover that American charges $200.00 a ticket PLUS the difference in price tickets! LIKE THAT IS GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE! So for the price of another ticket I can change my flight! I will be looking elsewhere for flights in the future. I have already paid for a flight and now you are trying to rip me off even more!?! Out of touch and terrible service to a customer of over 5 years. I will be going elsewhere where I don't get bent over the table. Thank you American!
Danyeale of Charlotte, NC," June 15, 2015","I originally booked my flight to Miami from Washington, DC back in July 2017. I was scheduled to fly September 13-18, 2017. I, like many, had to cancel my trip because of hurricane Irma. I was informed by two customer service representatives that I would be able to rebook my flight to Miami with no additional charges in fare and no change fees. Of course, when it comes time to book my flight, I'm informed about a change fee. I told the agent, I was reassured twice that I would not be charged any additional fees because my initial cancellation was weather related. "
Jason of Philadelphia, PA," June 14, 2015","American Airlines is full of **. Our cruise was cancelled due to Hurricane Irma. It was beyond our control and the airline stated there was nothing that they could do. No partial credit, changes or anything! I will not be flying with them anymore!"
Jadeyn of Tucson, AZ," June 13, 2015",My husband and I were scheduled to fly out at 7:15 am to go to California for a very important family matter. We do not live near the airport so we were up early to make sure we were early and nothing could go wrong. But things did go wrong. When we got to the airport we went and printed out tickets at the self checkout. We did notice that it mentioned no overhead storage for our carry on bags. So confused because we fly a lot and there is always overhead storage or they place in under the cabin. So we asked a lady that was standing in the area of self print and she looked and our tickets said we would be fine... Again we were told wrong.
Jackie of Clovis, CA," June 13, 2015","On September 4 my family of 5 arrived at the airport in Anchorage to fly home to Toronto via Dallas. Four of us had carry-on sized luggage but one had a mid-sized suitcase that we knew we would have to check. Our flight to Toronto included a 12.5-hour connection at DFW (not by choice). Since none of us sleep well on planes, we were considering going to a hotel following the overnight flight to DFW. When checking the suitcase, I specifically asked the American Airlines agent ""if we only check this bag to DFW and then go to a hotel for a few hours of sleep, will we be charged a second baggage fee to check the bag in for the flight to Toronto? If so we can rearrange the bags so that we can just check it through to Toronto."" "
Marylene of Aliso Viejo, CA," June 12, 2015","I purchased the basic economy ticket. When I was getting ready to board in Charlotte, the attendant mentioned that this was a new program for your airline and that customers have stated it was cost effective. However, this was not my case! I paid nearly $600 to fly from Columbus, OH to Asheville, NC. Absolutely absurd!!! In the future, I will do all I can to avoid flying with your airline and don't count on a positive recommendation from me to others! Also, stop charging for the first piece of checked in luggage!"
JoeAnn of Marshall , NC," June 12, 2015","I did a reservation with AA Sept 10, 2017 over the phone to Miami for Sept 12, 2017 in the flight # 1399. September 11 I checked the flight online and it was canceled. I called customer service. Patricia told me that I was wrong it wasn't cancel. I called at night again because I was worried I saw it was still cancel. After almost 2 hours they answered the phone. I told them what happened. They told me that they were very sorry but the flight was canceled and they didnt' have flight for Sept 12. They gave me 1 stop flight for Sept 13. "
Raymond of Elkton, MD," June 12, 2015","I was scheduled to fly out of Tampa International on Sunday, September, 17th to Durango, CO. I live in Sarasota, and just returned home the other day after evacuating for Hurricane Irma. I fled Florida and headed to Georgia, where I had to rent a hotel for a few nights. When I returned home I was fortunate enough not to have suffered damage. I of course have yard debris strewn about and I am still without power. The power company has estimated by the end of the day on September 22nd I will have power. With the extra costs incurred from having to leave my home, and the loss of power, I decided this was not a good time to travel."
Larry of Dayton, OH," June 12, 2015","Hurricane Irma was mess for AA. I get it. I'm sure there were thousands who were stuck trying to get their flights changed. Unfortunately, I was in Costa Rica with a connection via Miami and I got, as the AA agent said ""the short end of the stick."" I would be stuck almost another week in Costa Rica as everything AA had was booked out or cancelled. I saw a little bit of silver lining when I found that if I could get to Mexico city, I could fly home via DFW. However, AA would not change the ticket as it is against their rules to change the country of origin on a ticket. ""We cannot do it."" However, a more accurate description is ""will not."""
Marlee of La Mesa, CA," June 11, 2015","We were delayed on our AA out of Seattle due to having to wait on flight crew. Managed to make it to Dallas on time BUT had to sit on the tarmac for 20 mins waiting for a gait in order to deplane. This caused to miss our connecting flight. Next available flight is the next day. Asked about compensation for overnight hotel stay (there are 7 in our party, including a 3 year old) and were denied due to the delay being coded as weather related, which is absolutely bogus. So livid, frustrated, and tired at this point. Also found out AA has no number to call for complaints... You have to go through email so who knows if they will even read it or reply. Will never fly AA again if I can help it."
Makita of Waukegan, IL," June 11, 2015","I was on an almost 2 hour flight (Flight AA3936) stuck sitting with one leg over my bag and the other on the edge of the aisle. Not once was I asked to check in my bag nor told it wouldn't fit on the overhead bin. By the time we landed my knees, hips and back were killing me and I had to have help from the gentleman next to me to be able to stand up. So glad there wasn't an emergency 'cause this would have been one hell of a hazard. Lesson learned not to use this airline again."
Mary of Dallas, TX," June 11, 2015","American Airlines‰Û_the new standard for horrible service. Oh‰Û_I mean HORRIBLE! I travel very frequently for work and have stuck to one specific airline in order to build my status with them (ie. first class upgrades often, better seat choices, free checked bags). Recently, service has taken a turn for the worse. I‰Ûªm a reasonable guy and tolerate more than most. Call it my Southern hospitality, my upbringing or my service to the community when I served in law enforcement, but I just plain put up with more‰Û_until now."
E of Apopka, FL," June 11, 2015","I travel 80%~ for Work and have flown with almost every airline multiple times. AA is by far the worst. Not due to their customer service/staff/delays or anything like that (at least that I‰Ûªve noticed), but their planes have no entertainment system on each seat, they do not play movies on the overhead screens, and they don‰Ûªt even have a free WiFi movie/tv option you can connect to using your phone! I‰Ûªm currently on a flight from Boston to Phoenix and was utterly shocked when I sat in my seat and noticed no form of entertainment for a cross-country flight. Delta and other airlines provide personal entertainment screens on each screen or a smartphone connect feature for 2+ hr flights, which in turn make the flights more enjoyable. Anyways, to avoid rambling on and on about the lack of technology on AA planes I‰Ûªll just say if you enjoyed traveling in the late 90s early 2000s, then AA is for you. If you want to travel in 2017 and beyond, find a different airline."
Lee of Brooklyn, NY," June 11, 2015","I had a horrible experience today on my flight back to Miami. I have been an AAdvantage member for many years now and have always chosen to be loyal to American but after today's experience that may change. The onboarding process was fine and the flight was on time, which to be honest is rare but I was happy. When the snacks and beverage cart came the attendant did not smile, looked unhappy to take our beverage order, handed me and my husband 2 cookies, I then I told her, ""Can we just get pretzels?"" She said ""Then I need the cookies back."" I was honestly appalled."
Richard of Titusville, FL," June 11, 2015","Don't deserve single star. Also, I have a flight from Chicago to Minneapolis 5 hours from now. And they have seats available on the earlier flight but won't give you without charging $75. They are ok to make you wait or fly a flight with empty seats but no customer delight which is no cost to them. No customer driven company and not looking for going extra mile to make customer happy. Never travel on American Airlines again."
Ray of Tualatin, OR," June 10, 2015","Worst experience ever with AA never again, they treated my dad like garbage, they humiliated my dad in front of my niece travelling with him and in front of all passengers, just because my dad is ** and not fluent in English. I wish I could sue them for discrimination against my dad for not speaking English fluent instead of offering assistance in Spanish which, the sky harbor airport in Arizona has plenty of bilingual employees. DO NOT FLY AA EVER, pay more with a different airline. The only reason why my dad and niece flew AA to go to my brother's funeral, thank you AA for the worst day ever. It's a shame I have to put a star instead of no stars service."
Kelandis of Killeen, TX," June 10, 2015","This American Airlines review is out of frustration due to a lot of things. They're a disgrace! The employees are rude, there is no leg room, no entertainment, and treat people like herds of sheep. They have a ""New"" rule where they charge $50 at the gate to carry on your luggage. Are you kidding me? $50 for a carry on? And I can't even use the overhead bin! Disgraceful! Basically these guys are crooks! They're a disgrace. Last time I flew with American their flight was delayed by 2 hours and we ended up missing our connecting flight because it was the last flight out. We ended up having to stay an extra day and had to pay $100 for a hotel. We missed my sisters wedding. On the way back we ended up stuck on the tarmac for 2 hours. Of course!"
Debra of Fargo, ND," June 10, 2015","I booked a ticket back when the hurricane were hitting down south every other week. Because of that I was not able to attend my trip in GA. They told me I had up to a year to use my ticket. So when I try to rebook my ticket they are now close to $500. Mind you this is the highest rate out of all the airlines for my particular dates, I asked for a refund because I didn't wanna double what I paid the first time and I was told by the Supervisor (Willie ** in Dallas ) that my only option was to ""use it or lost it"". Being a supervisor myself I thought the tone in which he said it was very careless and he didn't try to help the situation at all. I would never talk to my customers the way he spoke to me especially after losing out on $300!!"
Ken of Fresno, OK," June 10, 2015","I just completed a flight on American Airlines. I had read negative reviews, but I found the American Airlines people I had contact with were great, tried to provide all the service they could because our flight had been cancelled due WX and had to layover at ORD. My complaint is the phoney coupon given for a hotel room for a ""discounted rate"". The coupon has nothing to do with American Airlines, but is only a hotel booking service. When I called the phone number provided I was told the only available room was 10 miles away and given a rate of $80.00. It was getting late in the evening so took it. Then was advised there was a $15 service charge to book the room. American Airline paid none of this. The shuttle bus to the hotel was packed (Other delayed passengers). When I got home I checked the hotel rate and found the same room went for $105. I ""saved"" $10. The hotel was a Holiday Inn Express. Room not bad."

She made up some baloney about Homeland Security not letting people fly with spots on their passport. I told her I checked their website and there was no mention of anything like that. She then claimed, ""Oh, they don't tell you."" I said, ""Then how are you supposed to know?""

I wanted to fly back before my actual trip date, due to obvious reasons. I even offered to provide them with a death certificate if need be (although, I don't think that is even something they should ask for right away). I spoke to 3 different customer service reps who were all horrible to speak with. They had zero compassion and empathy and just dismissed me as if what I was experiencing was far from a big deal to them. "

Sandra of Daphne, AL," June 7, 2015","Overall, (Un)American Airlines continues to disappoint. I really only ever fly with AA as a last resort, and I can't see any reason to recommend traveling with AA. I was prior active duty Army, and now I'm a reservist, and only American Airlines makes me feel like my service is less important now. United, Southwest, Jet Blue, Delta, every other airline doesn't discriminate between Active Duty and Reserve/Guardsmen when it comes to bag fees. So, along with uncomfortable, outdated planes and poor service, I spent a $100 checking bags to and from my destination."

I‰Ûªm currently on a flight from Boston to Phoenix and was utterly shocked when I sat in my seat and noticed no form of entertainment for a cross-country flight. Delta and other airlines provide personal entertainment screens on each screen or a smartphone connect feature for 2+ hr flights, which in turn make the flights more enjoyable. Anyways, to avoid rambling on and on about the lack of technology on AA planes I‰Ûªll just say if you enjoyed traveling in the late 90s early 2000s, then AA is for you. If you want to travel in 2017 and beyond, find a different airline."
LuAnn of Otsego, MI," May 25, 2015","I had a horrible experience today on my flight back to Miami. I have been an AAdvantage member for many years now and have always chosen to be loyal to American but after today's experience that may change. The onboarding process was fine and the flight was on time, which to be honest is rare but I was happy. When the snacks and beverage cart came the attendant did not smile, looked unhappy to take our beverage order, handed me and my husband 2 cookies, I then I told her, ""Can we just get pretzels?"" She said ""Then I need the cookies back."" I was honestly appalled."
Olga of New York, NY," May 25, 2015","Don't deserve single star. Also, I have a flight from Chicago to Minneapolis 5 hours from now. And they have seats available on the earlier flight but won't give you without charging $75. They are ok to make you wait or fly a flight with empty seats but no customer delight which is no cost to them. No customer driven company and not looking for going extra mile to make customer happy. Never travel on American Airlines again."
Manrique of Mesquite, TX," May 23, 2015","Worst experience ever with AA never again, they treated my dad like garbage, they humiliated my dad in front of my niece travelling with him and in front of all passengers, just because my dad is ** and not fluent in English. I wish I could sue them for discrimination against my dad for not speaking English fluent instead of offering assistance in Spanish which, the sky harbor airport in Arizona has plenty of bilingual employees. DO NOT FLY AA EVER, pay more with a different airline. The only reason why my dad and niece flew AA to go to my brother's funeral, thank you AA for the worst day ever. It's a shame I have to put a star instead of no stars service."
Phyllis of Riverside, RI," May 23, 2015","This American Airlines review is out of frustration due to a lot of things. They're a disgrace! The employees are rude, there is no leg room, no entertainment, and treat people like herds of sheep. They have a ""New"" rule where they charge $50 at the gate to carry on your luggage. Are you kidding me? $50 for a carry on? And I can't even use the overhead bin! Disgraceful! Basically these guys are crooks! They're a disgrace. Last time I flew with American their flight was delayed by 2 hours and we ended up missing our connecting flight because it was the last flight out. We ended up having to stay an extra day and had to pay $100 for a hotel. We missed my sisters wedding. On the way back we ended up stuck on the tarmac for 2 hours. Of course!"
Patrcia of Miami, FL," May 22, 2015","I booked a ticket back when the hurricane were hitting down south every other week. Because of that I was not able to attend my trip in GA. They told me I had up to a year to use my ticket. So when I try to rebook my ticket they are now close to $500. Mind you this is the highest rate out of all the airlines for my particular dates, I asked for a refund because I didn't wanna double what I paid the first time and I was told by the Supervisor (Willie ** in Dallas ) that my only option was to ""use it or lost it"". Being a supervisor myself I thought the tone in which he said it was very careless and he didn't try to help the situation at all. I would never talk to my customers the way he spoke to me especially after losing out on $300!!"
laura of Palm City, FL," May 22, 2015","I just completed a flight on American Airlines. I had read negative reviews, but I found the American Airlines people I had contact with were great, tried to provide all the service they could because our flight had been cancelled due WX and had to layover at ORD. My complaint is the phoney coupon given for a hotel room for a ""discounted rate"". The coupon has nothing to do with American Airlines, but is only a hotel booking service. When I called the phone number provided I was told the only available room was 10 miles away and given a rate of $80.00. It was getting late in the evening so took it. Then was advised there was a $15 service charge to book the room. American Airline paid none of this. The shuttle bus to the hotel was packed (Other delayed passengers). When I got home I checked the hotel rate and found the same room went for $105. I ""saved"" $10. The hotel was a Holiday Inn Express. Room not bad."

She made up some baloney about Homeland Security not letting people fly with spots on their passport. I told her I checked their website and there was no mention of anything like that. She then claimed, ""Oh, they don't tell you."" I said, ""Then how are you supposed to know?""

While I was away, I heard the news that my dad had passed away. In which, I contacted American Airlines right away and asked if anything can be done. I wanted to fly back before my actual trip date, due to obvious reasons. I even offered to provide them with a death certificate if need be (although, I don't think that is even something they should ask for right away). I spoke to 3 different customer service reps who were all horrible to speak with. They had zero compassion and empathy and just dismissed me as if what I was experiencing was far from a big deal to them. "
Shawana of Beaumont, TX," May 20, 2015","I was on the plane for 14 hours due to a delay. Sitting in a broken seat that would not recline. I told the stewardess and she could care less, said nothing she can do. After I got home I contacted the airline and they issued me a fourteen dollar credit. I had paid 197.34 dollars for preferred seats. The worst flight of my life, never again w/ this airline."
Emily of Kentucky, KY," May 20, 2015","Overall, (Un)American Airlines continues to disappoint. I really only ever fly with AA as a last resort, and I can't see any reason to recommend traveling with AA. I was prior active duty Army, and now I'm a reservist, and only American Airlines makes me feel like my service is less important now. United, Southwest, Jet Blue, Delta, every other airline doesn't discriminate between Active Duty and Reserve/Guardsmen when it comes to bag fees. So, along with uncomfortable, outdated planes and poor service, I spent a $100 checking bags to and from my destination."
Matt of Fayetteville, AR," May 20, 2015",American Airlines is the worst airlines to fly anywhere. They cram you in the seats with no leg room or any room for that matter. I requested a wheelchair at airport and waited 30 minutes upon someone finally arriving. They took me the wrong way to my next check in and I missed my flight. They said I would have to rebook my ticket and just wait for the next flight. Attendant at the gate was very disrespectful and not helpful at all. I had no control over this situation at all. Not to mention when I did finally arrive at my destination that I requested a wheelchair prior to my departure.
Carmen of Hugoton, KS," May 20, 2015","American Airlines is the worst airline in THE WORLD, and should change their name, it is utterly disgraceful that as an American they use this name. Their policy is to not apologize for anything, to be as rude as possible to people who are basically held hostage to them and their BS policies like closing the door to the gate while people are standing there then charging them money to rebook their flight, not caring at all about the bags on their way to a destination without the owners there to pick them up. Then being told when lodging a complaint that it was going in one ear and out the other. I have never been treated so poorly in my life, I will never again fly with this airline, I hope they go bankrupt and get the worst karma life can give. Oh yeah and I get to fly with them tomorrow. :/"
Jennifer of Peoria, AZ," May 19, 2015","Very disappointed. Unlikely I will ever choose American Airlines again. I didn't make my flight in the spring. I was given a voucher to use for future travel. Now I'm being told I can only use it myself, and not for my family. I don't want to use it for myself. What difference does it make? I'm being told different things by different people. The last guy hung up on me and I wasn't even rude to him. This is how AA does business? All I want is to not be penalized for cancelling a flight that was beyond my control. If you have a voucher it should be flexible to use for anyone. AA is the WORST! Hope they go out of business for this nonsense. Airline travel is a joke."
mathew of Calrksville, TN," May 19, 2015","American Airlines canceled my 92-year-old father-in-law's flight to Key West due to Hurricane Irma. On that day American Airline was contacted and the representative said there would be no problem re-booking, just use the reference number. American Airlines even went on TV and said they would waive re-booking fees. Today when calling to re-book the flight and after 57 minutes on the phone, I was told the flight could not be re-booked because it was in their notes I requested a refund. At no time did I request a refund and American Airlines could not locate any record of a refund request. Even so, American Airlines still insisted they could not re-book the flight or issue a refund. If we did not have enough trouble dealing with a Cat 4 hurricane and its devastating aftermath, now American Airlines is adding to the misery. All my father-in-law wants is to come to Key West and see that everyone is alright. Thanks, AA."
Jim of Tucson, AZ," May 19, 2015",I bought tickets for my mother in law and son to meet my wife and I in Colorado. We had traveled on different airlines due to connections and therefore were going back on different airlines. My wife and I left on our airplane. My mother in law and son were stranded as the plane had a mechanical. This was 8 AM and the bottom line was it didn't get fixed that day. American gave them a 12.00 voucher good in the terminal and did nothing to get them a room as the rooms they usually used weren't available.
Penny of Warner Robins, GA," May 19, 2015","I booked 2 separate flights on American Airlines in Economy since I pay for my air travel. On one they pre-assigned me a back-of-plane middle seat and said that I was required to pay some increased fee for window, aisle or closer to the front. On the second flight they said I have to wait until I reach the boarding gate for any seat. This is ridiculous and unacceptable. The airline has sufficient revenue to - just a suggestion - increase the ""base"" fare to cover a first-come-first-served seat selection and not put everyone into 3rd class or worse status. If they want to surcharge certain premium seats, like middle seats toward the front, that's OK, but this behavior is totally unacceptable and I refuse to fly them (or any airline) that abuses their passengers."
Beverley of Silver Spring, MD," May 19, 2015",Well I looked into changing my flight for my fiance and I to go home a day earlier... only to discover that American charges $200.00 a ticket PLUS the difference in price tickets! LIKE THAT IS GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE! So for the price of another ticket I can change my flight! I will be looking elsewhere for flights in the future. I have already paid for a flight and now you are trying to rip me off even more!?! Out of touch and terrible service to a customer of over 5 years. I will be going elsewhere where I don't get bent over the table. Thank you American!
Dorothe of Colonial Heights, VA," May 19, 2015","I originally booked my flight to Miami from Washington, DC back in July 2017. I was scheduled to fly September 13-18, 2017. I, like many, had to cancel my trip because of hurricane Irma. I was informed by two customer service representatives that I would be able to rebook my flight to Miami with no additional charges in fare and no change fees. Of course, when it comes time to book my flight, I'm informed about a change fee. I told the agent, I was reassured twice that I would not be charged any additional fees because my initial cancellation was weather related. "
Tariq of Windsor Locks, CT," May 19, 2015","American Airlines is full of **. Our cruise was cancelled due to Hurricane Irma. It was beyond our control and the airline stated there was nothing that they could do. No partial credit, changes or anything! I will not be flying with them anymore!"
Joe of Peekskill, NY," May 18, 2015",My husband and I were scheduled to fly out at 7:15 am to go to California for a very important family matter. We do not live near the airport so we were up early to make sure we were early and nothing could go wrong. But things did go wrong. When we got to the airport we went and printed out tickets at the self checkout. We did notice that it mentioned no overhead storage for our carry on bags. So confused because we fly a lot and there is always overhead storage or they place in under the cabin. So we asked a lady that was standing in the area of self print and she looked and our tickets said we would be fine... Again we were told wrong.
Andrew of Sparta, NJ," May 17, 2015","On September 4 my family of 5 arrived at the airport in Anchorage to fly home to Toronto via Dallas. Four of us had carry-on sized luggage but one had a mid-sized suitcase that we knew we would have to check. Our flight to Toronto included a 12.5-hour connection at DFW (not by choice). Since none of us sleep well on planes, we were considering going to a hotel following the overnight flight to DFW. When checking the suitcase, I specifically asked the American Airlines agent ""if we only check this bag to DFW and then go to a hotel for a few hours of sleep, will we be charged a second baggage fee to check the bag in for the flight to Toronto? If so we can rearrange the bags so that we can just check it through to Toronto."" "
Vic of Daphne, AL," May 17, 2015","I purchased the basic economy ticket. When I was getting ready to board in Charlotte, the attendant mentioned that this was a new program for your airline and that customers have stated it was cost effective. However, this was not my case! I paid nearly $600 to fly from Columbus, OH to Asheville, NC. Absolutely absurd!!! In the future, I will do all I can to avoid flying with your airline and don't count on a positive recommendation from me to others! Also, stop charging for the first piece of checked in luggage!"

They told me that they were very sorry but the flight was canceled and they didnt' have flight for Sept 12. They gave me 1 stop flight for Sept 13. "
Victor of Baton Rouge , LA," May 16, 2015","I was scheduled to fly out of Tampa International on Sunday, September, 17th to Durango, CO. I live in Sarasota, and just returned home the other day after evacuating for Hurricane Irma. I fled Florida and headed to Georgia, where I had to rent a hotel for a few nights. When I returned home I was fortunate enough not to have suffered damage. I of course have yard debris strewn about and I am still without power. The power company has estimated by the end of the day on September 22nd I will have power. With the extra costs incurred from having to leave my home, and the loss of power, I decided this was not a good time to travel."
Jay of San Antonio, TX," May 15, 2015","Hurricane Irma was mess for AA. I get it. I'm sure there were thousands who were stuck trying to get their flights changed. Unfortunately, I was in Costa Rica with a connection via Miami and I got, as the AA agent said ""the short end of the stick."" I would be stuck almost another week in Costa Rica as everything AA had was booked out or cancelled. I saw a little bit of silver lining when I found that if I could get to Mexico city, I could fly home via DFW. However, AA would not change the ticket as it is against their rules to change the country of origin on a ticket. ""We cannot do it."" However, a more accurate description is ""will not."""
Riauna of Tempe, AZ," May 14, 2015","We were delayed on our AA out of Seattle due to having to wait on flight crew. Managed to make it to Dallas on time BUT had to sit on the tarmac for 20 mins waiting for a gait in order to deplane. This caused to miss our connecting flight. Next available flight is the next day. Asked about compensation for overnight hotel stay (there are 7 in our party, including a 3 year old) and were denied due to the delay being coded as weather related, which is absolutely bogus. So livid, frustrated, and tired at this point. Also found out AA has no number to call for complaints... You have to go through email so who knows if they will even read it or reply. Will never fly AA again if I can help it."
Michael of Clinton, IA," May 14, 2015","I was on an almost 2 hour flight (Flight AA3936) stuck sitting with one leg over my bag and the other on the edge of the aisle. Not once was I asked to check in my bag nor told it wouldn't fit on the overhead bin. By the time we landed my knees, hips and back were killing me and I had to have help from the gentleman next to me to be able to stand up. So glad there wasn't an emergency 'cause this would have been one hell of a hazard. Lesson learned not to use this airline again."

On the second flight they said I have to wait until I reach the boarding gate for any seat. This is ridiculous and unacceptable. The airline has sufficient revenue to - just a suggestion - increase the ""base"" fare to cover a first-come-first-served seat selection and not put everyone into 3rd class or worse status. If they want to surcharge certain premium seats, like middle seats toward the front, that's OK, but this behavior is totally unacceptable and I refuse to fly them (or any airline) that abuses their passengers."
HITAISHI of Bristol, VA," May 4, 2015",Well I looked into changing my flight for my fiance and I to go home a day earlier... only to discover that American charges $200.00 a ticket PLUS the difference in price tickets! LIKE THAT IS GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE! So for the price of another ticket I can change my flight! I will be looking elsewhere for flights in the future. I have already paid for a flight and now you are trying to rip me off even more!?! Out of touch and terrible service to a customer of over 5 years. I will be going elsewhere where I don't get bent over the table. Thank you American!
Maurie of Clayton, MO," May 4, 2015","I originally booked my flight to Miami from Washington, DC back in July 2017. I was scheduled to fly September 13-18, 2017. I, like many, had to cancel my trip because of hurricane Irma. I was informed by two customer service representatives that I would be able to rebook my flight to Miami with no additional charges in fare and no change fees. Of course, when it comes time to book my flight, I'm informed about a change fee. I told the agent, I was reassured twice that I would not be charged any additional fees because my initial cancellation was weather related. "

Linda of Richmond, VA," May 3, 2015",My husband and I were scheduled to fly out at 7:15 am to go to California for a very important family matter. We do not live near the airport so we were up early to make sure we were early and nothing could go wrong. But things did go wrong. When we got to the airport we went and printed out tickets at the self checkout. We did notice that it mentioned no overhead storage for our carry on bags. So confused because we fly a lot and there is always overhead storage or they place in under the cabin. So we asked a lady that was standing in the area of self print and she looked and our tickets said we would be fine... Again we were told wrong.
wes of Mcminnville, OR," May 2, 2015","On September 4 my family of 5 arrived at the airport in Anchorage to fly home to Toronto via Dallas. Four of us had carry-on sized luggage but one had a mid-sized suitcase that we knew we would have to check. Our flight to Toronto included a 12.5-hour connection at DFW (not by choice). Since none of us sleep well on planes, we were considering going to a hotel following the overnight flight to DFW. When checking the suitcase, I specifically asked the American Airlines agent ""if we only check this bag to DFW and then go to a hotel for a few hours of sleep, will we be charged a second baggage fee to check the bag in for the flight to Toronto? If so we can rearrange the bags so that we can just check it through to Toronto."" "

In the future, I will do all I can to avoid flying with your airline and don't count on a positive recommendation from me to others! Also, stop charging for the first piece of checked in luggage!"

When I returned home I was fortunate enough not to have suffered damage. I of course have yard debris strewn about and I am still without power. The power company has estimated by the end of the day on September 22nd I will have power. With the extra costs incurred from having to leave my home, and the loss of power, I decided this was not a good time to travel."
Karim of Stanmore, Other," May 1, 2015","Hurricane Irma was mess for AA. I get it. I'm sure there were thousands who were stuck trying to get their flights changed. Unfortunately, I was in Costa Rica with a connection via Miami and I got, as the AA agent said ""the short end of the stick."" I would be stuck almost another week in Costa Rica as everything AA had was booked out or cancelled. I saw a little bit of silver lining when I found that if I could get to Mexico city, I could fly home via DFW. However, AA would not change the ticket as it is against their rules to change the country of origin on a ticket. ""We cannot do it."" However, a more accurate description is ""will not."""
Nadia of Gilbert, AZ," May 1, 2015","We were delayed on our AA out of Seattle due to having to wait on flight crew. Managed to make it to Dallas on time BUT had to sit on the tarmac for 20 mins waiting for a gait in order to deplane. This caused to miss our connecting flight. Next available flight is the next day. Asked about compensation for overnight hotel stay (there are 7 in our party, including a 3 year old) and were denied due to the delay being coded as weather related, which is absolutely bogus. So livid, frustrated, and tired at this point. Also found out AA has no number to call for complaints... You have to go through email so who knows if they will even read it or reply. Will never fly AA again if I can help it."
Jennifer of Grants Pass , OR," April 30, 2015","I was on an almost 2 hour flight (Flight AA3936) stuck sitting with one leg over my bag and the other on the edge of the aisle.

By the time we landed my knees, hips and back were killing me and I had to have help from the gentleman next to me to be able to stand up. So glad there wasn't an emergency 'cause this would have been one hell of a hazard. Lesson learned not to use this airline again."
Marco of Hong Kong, Other," April 29, 2015","American Airlines‰Û_the new standard for horrible service. Oh‰Û_I mean HORRIBLE!

ronald of Sanborn, NY," April 28, 2015","I travel 80%~ for Work and have flown with almost every airline multiple times. AA is by far the worst. Not due to their customer service/staff/delays or anything like that (at least that I‰Ûªve noticed), but their planes have no entertainment system on each seat, they do not play movies on the overhead screens, and they don‰Ûªt even have a free WiFi movie/tv option you can connect to using your phone! I‰Ûªm currently on a flight from Boston to Phoenix and was utterly shocked when I sat in my seat and noticed no form of entertainment for a cross-country flight. Delta and other airlines provide personal entertainment screens on each screen or a smartphone connect feature for 2+ hr flights, which in turn make the flights more enjoyable. Anyways, to avoid rambling on and on about the lack of technology on AA planes I‰Ûªll just say if you enjoyed traveling in the late 90s early 2000s, then AA is for you. If you want to travel in 2017 and beyond, find a different airline."
Alex of Portland, OR," April 27, 2015","I had a horrible experience today on my flight back to Miami. I have been an AAdvantage member for many years now and have always chosen to be loyal to American but after today's experience that may change. The onboarding process was fine and the flight was on time, which to be honest is rare but I was happy. When the snacks and beverage cart came the attendant did not smile, looked unhappy to take our beverage order, handed me and my husband 2 cookies, I then I told her, ""Can we just get pretzels?"" She said ""Then I need the cookies back."" I was honestly appalled."
Lue Ella of Fontana, CA," April 26, 2015","Don't deserve single star. Also, I have a flight from Chicago to Minneapolis 5 hours from now. And they have seats available on the earlier flight but won't give you without charging $75. They are ok to make you wait or fly a flight with empty seats but no customer delight which is no cost to them. No customer driven company and not looking for going extra mile to make customer happy. Never travel on American Airlines again."
Kelly of Whitefish Bay, WI," April 26, 2015","Worst experience ever with AA never again, they treated my dad like garbage, they humiliated my dad in front of my niece travelling with him and in front of all passengers, just because my dad is ** and not fluent in English. I wish I could sue them for discrimination against my dad for not speaking English fluent instead of offering assistance in Spanish which, the sky harbor airport in Arizona has plenty of bilingual employees. DO NOT FLY AA EVER, pay more with a different airline. The only reason why my dad and niece flew AA to go to my brother's funeral, thank you AA for the worst day ever. It's a shame I have to put a star instead of no stars service."
Stephen of Springtown, TX," April 25, 2015","This American Airlines review is out of frustration due to a lot of things. They're a disgrace! The employees are rude, there is no leg room, no entertainment, and treat people like herds of sheep. They have a ""New"" rule where they charge $50 at the gate to carry on your luggage. Are you kidding me? $50 for a carry on? And I can't even use the overhead bin! Disgraceful! Basically these guys are crooks! They're a disgrace. Last time I flew with American their flight was delayed by 2 hours and we ended up missing our connecting flight because it was the last flight out. We ended up having to stay an extra day and had to pay $100 for a hotel. We missed my sisters wedding. On the way back we ended up stuck on the tarmac for 2 hours. Of course!"
Sandra of Mastic, NY," April 25, 2015","I booked a ticket back when the hurricane were hitting down south every other week. Because of that I was not able to attend my trip in GA. They told me I had up to a year to use my ticket. So when I try to rebook my ticket they are now close to $500. Mind you this is the highest rate out of all the airlines for my particular dates, I asked for a refund because I didn't wanna double what I paid the first time and I was told by the Supervisor (Willie ** in Dallas ) that my only option was to ""use it or lost it"". Being a supervisor myself I thought the tone in which he said it was very careless and he didn't try to help the situation at all. I would never talk to my customers the way he spoke to me especially after losing out on $300!!"
Lorraine of Brooklyn , NY," April 25, 2015","I just completed a flight on American Airlines. I had read negative reviews, but I found the American Airlines people I had contact with were great, tried to provide all the service they could because our flight had been cancelled due WX and had to layover at ORD. My complaint is the phoney coupon given for a hotel room for a ""discounted rate"". The coupon has nothing to do with American Airlines, but is only a hotel booking service. When I called the phone number provided I was told the only available room was 10 miles away and given a rate of $80.00. It was getting late in the evening so took it. Then was advised there was a $15 service charge to book the room. American Airline paid none of this. The shuttle bus to the hotel was packed (Other delayed passengers). When I got home I checked the hotel rate and found the same room went for $105. I ""saved"" $10. The hotel was a Holiday Inn Express. Room not bad."

She made up some baloney about Homeland Security not letting people fly with spots on their passport. I told her I checked their website and there was no mention of anything like that. She then claimed, ""Oh, they don't tell you."" I said, ""Then how are you supposed to know?""

While I was away, I heard the news that my dad had passed away. In which, I contacted American Airlines right away and asked if anything can be done. I wanted to fly back before my actual trip date, due to obvious reasons. I even offered to provide them with a death certificate if need be (although, I don't think that is even something they should ask for right away). I spoke to 3 different customer service reps who were all horrible to speak with. They had zero compassion and empathy and just dismissed me as if what I was experiencing was far from a big deal to them. "

I had paid 197.34 dollars for preferred seats. The worst flight of my life, never again w/ this airline."
Dennis of Valley Village, CA," April 20, 2015","Overall, (Un)American Airlines continues to disappoint. I really only ever fly with AA as a last resort, and I can't see any reason to recommend traveling with AA. I was prior active duty Army, and now I'm a reservist, and only American Airlines makes me feel like my service is less important now. United, Southwest, Jet Blue, Delta, every other airline doesn't discriminate between Active Duty and Reserve/Guardsmen when it comes to bag fees. So, along with uncomfortable, outdated planes and poor service, I spent a $100 checking bags to and from my destination."
TREVOR of Spring Valley, NY," April 20, 2015",American Airlines is the worst airlines to fly anywhere. They cram you in the seats with no leg room or any room for that matter. I requested a wheelchair at airport and waited 30 minutes upon someone finally arriving. They took me the wrong way to my next check in and I missed my flight. They said I would have to rebook my ticket and just wait for the next flight. Attendant at the gate was very disrespectful and not helpful at all. I had no control over this situation at all. Not to mention when I did finally arrive at my destination that I requested a wheelchair prior to my departure.
Linda of Santa Barbara, CA," April 20, 2015","American Airlines is the worst airline in THE WORLD, and should change their name, it is utterly disgraceful that as an American they use this name. Their policy is to not apologize for anything, to be as rude as possible to people who are basically held hostage to them and their BS policies like closing the door to the gate while people are standing there then charging them money to rebook their flight, not caring at all about the bags on their way to a destination without the owners there to pick them up. Then being told when lodging a complaint that it was going in one ear and out the other. I have never been treated so poorly in my life, I will never again fly with this airline, I hope they go bankrupt and get the worst karma life can give. Oh yeah and I get to fly with them tomorrow. :/"
Krista of Santa Fe , NM," April 20, 2015","Very disappointed. Unlikely I will ever choose American Airlines again. I didn't make my flight in the spring. I was given a voucher to use for future travel. Now I'm being told I can only use it myself, and not for my family. I don't want to use it for myself. What difference does it make? I'm being told different things by different people. The last guy hung up on me and I wasn't even rude to him. This is how AA does business? All I want is to not be penalized for cancelling a flight that was beyond my control. If you have a voucher it should be flexible to use for anyone. AA is the WORST! Hope they go out of business for this nonsense. Airline travel is a joke."
Christina of Leichhardt Nsw , Other," April 20, 2015","American Airlines canceled my 92-year-old father-in-law's flight to Key West due to Hurricane Irma. On that day American Airline was contacted and the representative said there would be no problem re-booking, just use the reference number. American Airlines even went on TV and said they would waive re-booking fees. Today when calling to re-book the flight and after 57 minutes on the phone, I was told the flight could not be re-booked because it was in their notes I requested a refund. At no time did I request a refund and American Airlines could not locate any record of a refund request. Even so, American Airlines still insisted they could not re-book the flight or issue a refund. If we did not have enough trouble dealing with a Cat 4 hurricane and its devastating aftermath, now American Airlines is adding to the misery. All my father-in-law wants is to come to Key West and see that everyone is alright. Thanks, AA."

Mind you this is the highest rate out of all the airlines for my particular dates, I asked for a refund because I didn't wanna double what I paid the first time and I was told by the Supervisor (Willie ** in Dallas ) that my only option was to ""use it or lost it"". Being a supervisor myself I thought the tone in which he said it was very careless and he didn't try to help the situation at all. I would never talk to my customers the way he spoke to me especially after losing out on $300!!"
Andrew of Schaumburg , IL," April 10, 2015","I just completed a flight on American Airlines. I had read negative reviews, but I found the American Airlines people I had contact with were great, tried to provide all the service they could because our flight had been cancelled due WX and had to layover at ORD. My complaint is the phoney coupon given for a hotel room for a ""discounted rate"". The coupon has nothing to do with American Airlines, but is only a hotel booking service. When I called the phone number provided I was told the only available room was 10 miles away and given a rate of $80.00. It was getting late in the evening so took it. Then was advised there was a $15 service charge to book the room. American Airline paid none of this. The shuttle bus to the hotel was packed (Other delayed passengers). When I got home I checked the hotel rate and found the same room went for $105. I ""saved"" $10. The hotel was a Holiday Inn Express. Room not bad."

She made up some baloney about Homeland Security not letting people fly with spots on their passport. I told her I checked their website and there was no mention of anything like that. She then claimed, ""Oh, they don't tell you."" I said, ""Then how are you supposed to know?""

While I was away, I heard the news that my dad had passed away. In which, I contacted American Airlines right away and asked if anything can be done. I wanted to fly back before my actual trip date, due to obvious reasons. I even offered to provide them with a death certificate if need be (although, I don't think that is even something they should ask for right away). I spoke to 3 different customer service reps who were all horrible to speak with. They had zero compassion and empathy and just dismissed me as if what I was experiencing was far from a big deal to them. "
Cherie of Wheatley Hts, NY," April 8, 2015","I was on the plane for 14 hours due to a delay. Sitting in a broken seat that would not recline. I told the stewardess and she could care less, said nothing she can do. After I got home I contacted the airline and they issued me a fourteen dollar credit. I had paid 197.34 dollars for preferred seats. The worst flight of my life, never again w/ this airline."
Bing of Lexington, KY," April 8, 2015","Overall, (Un)American Airlines continues to disappoint. I really only ever fly with AA as a last resort, and I can't see any reason to recommend traveling with AA. I was prior active duty Army, and now I'm a reservist, and only American Airlines makes me feel like my service is less important now. United, Southwest, Jet Blue, Delta, every other airline doesn't discriminate between Active Duty and Reserve/Guardsmen when it comes to bag fees. So, along with uncomfortable, outdated planes and poor service, I spent a $100 checking bags to and from my destination."
Emily of Garfield, NJ," April 7, 2015",American Airlines is the worst airlines to fly anywhere. They cram you in the seats with no leg room or any room for that matter. I requested a wheelchair at airport and waited 30 minutes upon someone finally arriving. They took me the wrong way to my next check in and I missed my flight. They said I would have to rebook my ticket and just wait for the next flight. Attendant at the gate was very disrespectful and not helpful at all. I had no control over this situation at all. Not to mention when I did finally arrive at my destination that I requested a wheelchair prior to my departure.
Nina of Eagleville, PA," April 6, 2015","American Airlines is the worst airline in THE WORLD, and should change their name, it is utterly disgraceful that as an American they use this name. Their policy is to not apologize for anything, to be as rude as possible to people who are basically held hostage to them and their BS policies like closing the door to the gate while people are standing there then charging them money to rebook their flight, not caring at all about the bags on their way to a destination without the owners there to pick them up. Then being told when lodging a complaint that it was going in one ear and out the other. I have never been treated so poorly in my life, I will never again fly with this airline, I hope they go bankrupt and get the worst karma life can give. Oh yeah and I get to fly with them tomorrow. :/"
Lauren of Burlington, MA," April 5, 2015","Very disappointed. Unlikely I will ever choose American Airlines again. I didn't make my flight in the spring. I was given a voucher to use for future travel. Now I'm being told I can only use it myself, and not for my family. I don't want to use it for myself. What difference does it make? I'm being told different things by different people. The last guy hung up on me and I wasn't even rude to him. This is how AA does business? All I want is to not be penalized for cancelling a flight that was beyond my control. If you have a voucher it should be flexible to use for anyone. AA is the WORST! Hope they go out of business for this nonsense. Airline travel is a joke."
Alicia of Toronto, ON," April 4, 2015","American Airlines canceled my 92-year-old father-in-law's flight to Key West due to Hurricane Irma. On that day American Airline was contacted and the representative said there would be no problem re-booking, just use the reference number. American Airlines even went on TV and said they would waive re-booking fees. Today when calling to re-book the flight and after 57 minutes on the phone, I was told the flight could not be re-booked because it was in their notes I requested a refund. At no time did I request a refund and American Airlines could not locate any record of a refund request. Even so, American Airlines still insisted they could not re-book the flight or issue a refund. If we did not have enough trouble dealing with a Cat 4 hurricane and its devastating aftermath, now American Airlines is adding to the misery. All my father-in-law wants is to come to Key West and see that everyone is alright. Thanks, AA."
Carol of New Haven, CT," April 4, 2015",I bought tickets for my mother in law and son to meet my wife and I in Colorado. We had traveled on different airlines due to connections and therefore were going back on different airlines. My wife and I left on our airplane. My mother in law and son were stranded as the plane had a mechanical. This was 8 AM and the bottom line was it didn't get fixed that day. American gave them a 12.00 voucher good in the terminal and did nothing to get them a room as the rooms they usually used weren't available.
Greg of Las Vegas, NV," April 3, 2015","I booked 2 separate flights on American Airlines in Economy since I pay for my air travel. On one they pre-assigned me a back-of-plane middle seat and said that I was required to pay some increased fee for window, aisle or closer to the front. On the second flight they said I have to wait until I reach the boarding gate for any seat. This is ridiculous and unacceptable. The airline has sufficient revenue to - just a suggestion - increase the ""base"" fare to cover a first-come-first-served seat selection and not put everyone into 3rd class or worse status. If they want to surcharge certain premium seats, like middle seats toward the front, that's OK, but this behavior is totally unacceptable and I refuse to fly them (or any airline) that abuses their passengers."
Aneta of Lawrence, MA," April 3, 2015",Well I looked into changing my flight for my fiance and I to go home a day earlier... only to discover that American charges $200.00 a ticket PLUS the difference in price tickets! LIKE THAT IS GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE! So for the price of another ticket I can change my flight! I will be looking elsewhere for flights in the future. I have already paid for a flight and now you are trying to rip me off even more!?! Out of touch and terrible service to a customer of over 5 years. I will be going elsewhere where I don't get bent over the table. Thank you American!

I was informed by two customer service representatives that I would be able to rebook my flight to Miami with no additional charges in fare and no change fees. Of course, when it comes time to book my flight, I'm informed about a change fee. I told the agent, I was reassured twice that I would not be charged any additional fees because my initial cancellation was weather related. "
tori of Newton, NC," April 2, 2015","American Airlines is full of **. Our cruise was cancelled due to Hurricane Irma. It was beyond our control and the airline stated there was nothing that they could do. No partial credit, changes or anything! I will not be flying with them anymore!"
tim of Chico, CA," April 2, 2015",My husband and I were scheduled to fly out at 7:15 am to go to California for a very important family matter. We do not live near the airport so we were up early to make sure we were early and nothing could go wrong. But things did go wrong. When we got to the airport we went and printed out tickets at the self checkout. We did notice that it mentioned no overhead storage for our carry on bags. So confused because we fly a lot and there is always overhead storage or they place in under the cabin. So we asked a lady that was standing in the area of self print and she looked and our tickets said we would be fine... Again we were told wrong.
Larry of Cameron Park, CA," April 1, 2015","On September 4 my family of 5 arrived at the airport in Anchorage to fly home to Toronto via Dallas. Four of us had carry-on sized luggage but one had a mid-sized suitcase that we knew we would have to check. Our flight to Toronto included a 12.5-hour connection at DFW (not by choice). Since none of us sleep well on planes, we were considering going to a hotel following the overnight flight to DFW. When checking the suitcase, I specifically asked the American Airlines agent ""if we only check this bag to DFW and then go to a hotel for a few hours of sleep, will we be charged a second baggage fee to check the bag in for the flight to Toronto? If so we can rearrange the bags so that we can just check it through to Toronto."" "

In the future, I will do all I can to avoid flying with your airline and don't count on a positive recommendation from me to others! Also, stop charging for the first piece of checked in luggage!"

I called at night again because I was worried I saw it was still cancel. After almost 2 hours they answered the phone. I told them what happened. They told me that they were very sorry but the flight was canceled and they didnt' have flight for Sept 12. They gave me 1 stop flight for Sept 13. "
Arati of Herndon, VA," March 31, 2015","I was scheduled to fly out of Tampa International on Sunday, September, 17th to Durango, CO. I live in Sarasota, and just returned home the other day after evacuating for Hurricane Irma. I fled Florida and headed to Georgia, where I had to rent a hotel for a few nights. When I returned home I was fortunate enough not to have suffered damage. I of course have yard debris strewn about and I am still without power. The power company has estimated by the end of the day on September 22nd I will have power. With the extra costs incurred from having to leave my home, and the loss of power, I decided this was not a good time to travel."
Ronaldo of Sao Paulo, Other," March 31, 2015","Hurricane Irma was mess for AA. I get it. I'm sure there were thousands who were stuck trying to get their flights changed. Unfortunately, I was in Costa Rica with a connection via Miami and I got, as the AA agent said ""the short end of the stick."" I would be stuck almost another week in Costa Rica as everything AA had was booked out or cancelled. I saw a little bit of silver lining when I found that if I could get to Mexico city, I could fly home via DFW. However, AA would not change the ticket as it is against their rules to change the country of origin on a ticket. ""We cannot do it."" However, a more accurate description is ""will not."""
SANDRA of Dallas, TX," March 29, 2015","We were delayed on our AA out of Seattle due to having to wait on flight crew. Managed to make it to Dallas on time BUT had to sit on the tarmac for 20 mins waiting for a gait in order to deplane. This caused to miss our connecting flight. Next available flight is the next day. Asked about compensation for overnight hotel stay (there are 7 in our party, including a 3 year old) and were denied due to the delay being coded as weather related, which is absolutely bogus. So livid, frustrated, and tired at this point. Also found out AA has no number to call for complaints... You have to go through email so who knows if they will even read it or reply. Will never fly AA again if I can help it."
Levina of Los Angeles, CA," March 29, 2015","I was on an almost 2 hour flight (Flight AA3936) stuck sitting with one leg over my bag and the other on the edge of the aisle. Not once was I asked to check in my bag nor told it wouldn't fit on the overhead bin. By the time we landed my knees, hips and back were killing me and I had to have help from the gentleman next to me to be able to stand up. So glad there wasn't an emergency 'cause this would have been one hell of a hazard. Lesson learned not to use this airline again."
Regina of Rancho Palos Verdes, CA," March 29, 2015","American Airlines‰Û_the new standard for horrible service. Oh‰Û_I mean HORRIBLE! I travel very frequently for work and have stuck to one specific airline in order to build my status with them (ie. first class upgrades often, better seat choices, free checked bags). Recently, service has taken a turn for the worse. I‰Ûªm a reasonable guy and tolerate more than most. Call it my Southern hospitality, my upbringing or my service to the community when I served in law enforcement, but I just plain put up with more‰Û_until now."
Jonathan of Anchorage, AK," March 28, 2015","I travel 80%~ for Work and have flown with almost every airline multiple times. AA is by far the worst. Not due to their customer service/staff/delays or anything like that (at least that I‰Ûªve noticed), but their planes have no entertainment system on each seat, they do not play movies on the overhead screens, and they don‰Ûªt even have a free WiFi movie/tv option you can connect to using your phone! I‰Ûªm currently on a flight from Boston to Phoenix and was utterly shocked when I sat in my seat and noticed no form of entertainment for a cross-country flight. Delta and other airlines provide personal entertainment screens on each screen or a smartphone connect feature for 2+ hr flights, which in turn make the flights more enjoyable. Anyways, to avoid rambling on and on about the lack of technology on AA planes I‰Ûªll just say if you enjoyed traveling in the late 90s early 2000s, then AA is for you. If you want to travel in 2017 and beyond, find a different airline."
Carol of Brooklyn, NY," March 27, 2015","I had a horrible experience today on my flight back to Miami. I have been an AAdvantage member for many years now and have always chosen to be loyal to American but after today's experience that may change. The onboarding process was fine and the flight was on time, which to be honest is rare but I was happy. When the snacks and beverage cart came the attendant did not smile, looked unhappy to take our beverage order, handed me and my husband 2 cookies, I then I told her, ""Can we just get pretzels?"" She said ""Then I need the cookies back."" I was honestly appalled."
Dan of Colorado Springs, CO," March 27, 2015","Don't deserve single star. Also, I have a flight from Chicago to Minneapolis 5 hours from now. And they have seats available on the earlier flight but won't give you without charging $75. They are ok to make you wait or fly a flight with empty seats but no customer delight which is no cost to them. No customer driven company and not looking for going extra mile to make customer happy. Never travel on American Airlines again."
Kim of Calgaey, AB," March 27, 2015","Worst experience ever with AA never again, they treated my dad like garbage, they humiliated my dad in front of my niece travelling with him and in front of all passengers, just because my dad is ** and not fluent in English. I wish I could sue them for discrimination against my dad for not speaking English fluent instead of offering assistance in Spanish which, the sky harbor airport in Arizona has plenty of bilingual employees. DO NOT FLY AA EVER, pay more with a different airline. The only reason why my dad and niece flew AA to go to my brother's funeral, thank you AA for the worst day ever. It's a shame I have to put a star instead of no stars service."
Boris of Upland, CA," March 25, 2015","This American Airlines review is out of frustration due to a lot of things. They're a disgrace!

Are you kidding me? $50 for a carry on? And I can't even use the overhead bin! Disgraceful! Basically these guys are crooks! They're a disgrace. Last time I flew with American their flight was delayed by 2 hours and we ended up missing our connecting flight because it was the last flight out. We ended up having to stay an extra day and had to pay $100 for a hotel. We missed my sisters wedding. On the way back we ended up stuck on the tarmac for 2 hours. Of course!"

However, this was not my case! I paid nearly $600 to fly from Columbus, OH to Asheville, NC. Absolutely absurd!!! In the future, I will do all I can to avoid flying with your airline and don't count on a positive recommendation from me to others! Also, stop charging for the first piece of checked in luggage!"

I called at night again because I was worried I saw it was still cancel. After almost 2 hours they answered the phone. I told them what happened. They told me that they were very sorry but the flight was canceled and they didnt' have flight for Sept 12. They gave me 1 stop flight for Sept 13. "
laura of Brooklyn, NY," March 15, 2015","I was scheduled to fly out of Tampa International on Sunday, September, 17th to Durango, CO. I live in Sarasota, and just returned home the other day after evacuating for Hurricane Irma. I fled Florida and headed to Georgia, where I had to rent a hotel for a few nights. When I returned home I was fortunate enough not to have suffered damage. I of course have yard debris strewn about and I am still without power. The power company has estimated by the end of the day on September 22nd I will have power. With the extra costs incurred from having to leave my home, and the loss of power, I decided this was not a good time to travel."
Angela of Marina Del Rey, CA," March 15, 2015","Hurricane Irma was mess for AA. I get it. I'm sure there were thousands who were stuck trying to get their flights changed. Unfortunately, I was in Costa Rica with a connection via Miami and I got, as the AA agent said ""the short end of the stick."" I would be stuck almost another week in Costa Rica as everything AA had was booked out or cancelled. I saw a little bit of silver lining when I found that if I could get to Mexico city, I could fly home via DFW. However, AA would not change the ticket as it is against their rules to change the country of origin on a ticket. ""We cannot do it."" However, a more accurate description is ""will not."""
Warren of Waterford , CT," March 14, 2015","We were delayed on our AA out of Seattle due to having to wait on flight crew. Managed to make it to Dallas on time BUT had to sit on the tarmac for 20 mins waiting for a gait in order to deplane. This caused to miss our connecting flight. Next available flight is the next day. Asked about compensation for overnight hotel stay (there are 7 in our party, including a 3 year old) and were denied due to the delay being coded as weather related, which is absolutely bogus. So livid, frustrated, and tired at this point. Also found out AA has no number to call for complaints... You have to go through email so who knows if they will even read it or reply. Will never fly AA again if I can help it."
Liz of Houston, TX," March 14, 2015","I was on an almost 2 hour flight (Flight AA3936) stuck sitting with one leg over my bag and the other on the edge of the aisle.

By the time we landed my knees, hips and back were killing me and I had to have help from the gentleman next to me to be able to stand up. So glad there wasn't an emergency 'cause this would have been one hell of a hazard. Lesson learned not to use this airline again."
monica of Louisville, KY," March 13, 2015","American Airlines‰Û_the new standard for horrible service. Oh‰Û_I mean HORRIBLE! I travel very frequently for work and have stuck to one specific airline in order to build my status with them (ie. first class upgrades often, better seat choices, free checked bags). Recently, service has taken a turn for the worse. I‰Ûªm a reasonable guy and tolerate more than most.

Susan of Cranston, RI," March 12, 2015","I travel 80%~ for Work and have flown with almost every airline multiple times. AA is by far the worst. Not due to their customer service/staff/delays or anything like that (at least that I‰Ûªve noticed), but their planes have no entertainment system on each seat, they do not play movies on the overhead screens, and they don‰Ûªt even have a free WiFi movie/tv option you can connect to using your phone! I‰Ûªm currently on a flight from Boston to Phoenix and was utterly shocked when I sat in my seat and noticed no form of entertainment for a cross-country flight. Delta and other airlines provide personal entertainment screens on each screen or a smartphone connect feature for 2+ hr flights, which in turn make the flights more enjoyable. Anyways, to avoid rambling on and on about the lack of technology on AA planes I‰Ûªll just say if you enjoyed traveling in the late 90s early 2000s, then AA is for you. If you want to travel in 2017 and beyond, find a different airline."
jill of Chesapeake, VA," March 12, 2015","I had a horrible experience today on my flight back to Miami. I have been an AAdvantage member for many years now and have always chosen to be loyal to American but after today's experience that may change. The onboarding process was fine and the flight was on time, which to be honest is rare but I was happy. When the snacks and beverage cart came the attendant did not smile, looked unhappy to take our beverage order, handed me and my husband 2 cookies, I then I told her, ""Can we just get pretzels?"" She said ""Then I need the cookies back."" I was honestly appalled."
Nicole of Charlottesville, VA," March 11, 2015","Don't deserve single star. Also, I have a flight from Chicago to Minneapolis 5 hours from now. And they have seats available on the earlier flight but won't give you without charging $75. They are ok to make you wait or fly a flight with empty seats but no customer delight which is no cost to them. No customer driven company and not looking for going extra mile to make customer happy. Never travel on American Airlines again."
Lisa-Marie of Westland, MI," March 10, 2015","Worst experience ever with AA never again, they treated my dad like garbage, they humiliated my dad in front of my niece travelling with him and in front of all passengers, just because my dad is ** and not fluent in English. I wish I could sue them for discrimination against my dad for not speaking English fluent instead of offering assistance in Spanish which, the sky harbor airport in Arizona has plenty of bilingual employees. DO NOT FLY AA EVER, pay more with a different airline. The only reason why my dad and niece flew AA to go to my brother's funeral, thank you AA for the worst day ever.

neal of Phoenix, AZ," March 10, 2015","This American Airlines review is out of frustration due to a lot of things. They're a disgrace! The employees are rude, there is no leg room, no entertainment, and treat people like herds of sheep. They have a ""New"" rule where they charge $50 at the gate to carry on your luggage. Are you kidding me? $50 for a carry on? And I can't even use the overhead bin! Disgraceful! Basically these guys are crooks! They're a disgrace. Last time I flew with American their flight was delayed by 2 hours and we ended up missing our connecting flight because it was the last flight out. We ended up having to stay an extra day and had to pay $100 for a hotel. We missed my sisters wedding. On the way back we ended up stuck on the tarmac for 2 hours. Of course!"
Lynne of Peoria, AZ," March 10, 2015","I booked a ticket back when the hurricane were hitting down south every other week. Because of that I was not able to attend my trip in GA. They told me I had up to a year to use my ticket. So when I try to rebook my ticket they are now close to $500. Mind you this is the highest rate out of all the airlines for my particular dates, I asked for a refund because I didn't wanna double what I paid the first time and I was told by the Supervisor (Willie ** in Dallas ) that my only option was to ""use it or lost it"". Being a supervisor myself I thought the tone in which he said it was very careless and he didn't try to help the situation at all. I would never talk to my customers the way he spoke to me especially after losing out on $300!!"
Julie of Lakeway, TX," March 10, 2015","I just completed a flight on American Airlines. I had read negative reviews, but I found the American Airlines people I had contact with were great, tried to provide all the service they could because our flight had been cancelled due WX and had to layover at ORD. My complaint is the phoney coupon given for a hotel room for a ""discounted rate"". The coupon has nothing to do with American Airlines, but is only a hotel booking service. When I called the phone number provided I was told the only available room was 10 miles away and given a rate of $80.00. It was getting late in the evening so took it. Then was advised there was a $15 service charge to book the room. American Airline paid none of this. The shuttle bus to the hotel was packed (Other delayed passengers). When I got home I checked the hotel rate and found the same room went for $105. I ""saved"" $10. The hotel was a Holiday Inn Express. Room not bad."

I wanted to fly back before my actual trip date, due to obvious reasons. I even offered to provide them with a death certificate if need be (although, I don't think that is even something they should ask for right away).

I told the stewardess and she could care less, said nothing she can do. After I got home I contacted the airline and they issued me a fourteen dollar credit. I had paid 197.34 dollars for preferred seats. The worst flight of my life, never again w/ this airline."
Alesia of Lynchburg, VA," March 8, 2015","Overall, (Un)American Airlines continues to disappoint. I really only ever fly with AA as a last resort, and I can't see any reason to recommend traveling with AA. I was prior active duty Army, and now I'm a reservist, and only American Airlines makes me feel like my service is less important now. United, Southwest, Jet Blue, Delta, every other airline doesn't discriminate between Active Duty and Reserve/Guardsmen when it comes to bag fees. So, along with uncomfortable, outdated planes and poor service, I spent a $100 checking bags to and from my destination."
Rachel of Minneapolis, MN," March 7, 2015",American Airlines is the worst airlines to fly anywhere. They cram you in the seats with no leg room or any room for that matter. I requested a wheelchair at airport and waited 30 minutes upon someone finally arriving. They took me the wrong way to my next check in and I missed my flight. They said I would have to rebook my ticket and just wait for the next flight. Attendant at the gate was very disrespectful and not helpful at all. I had no control over this situation at all. Not to mention when I did finally arrive at my destination that I requested a wheelchair prior to my departure.
MIKE of Pulaski, NY," March 7, 2015","American Airlines is the worst airline in THE WORLD, and should change their name, it is utterly disgraceful that as an American they use this name. Their policy is to not apologize for anything, to be as rude as possible to people who are basically held hostage to them and their BS policies like closing the door to the gate while people are standing there then charging them money to rebook their flight, not caring at all about the bags on their way to a destination without the owners there to pick them up. Then being told when lodging a complaint that it was going in one ear and out the other. I have never been treated so poorly in my life, I will never again fly with this airline, I hope they go bankrupt and get the worst karma life can give. Oh yeah and I get to fly with them tomorrow. :/"
Teresa of Auburn, CA," March 6, 2015","Very disappointed. Unlikely I will ever choose American Airlines again. I didn't make my flight in the spring. I was given a voucher to use for future travel. Now I'm being told I can only use it myself, and not for my family. I don't want to use it for myself. What difference does it make? I'm being told different things by different people. The last guy hung up on me and I wasn't even rude to him. This is how AA does business? All I want is to not be penalized for cancelling a flight that was beyond my control. If you have a voucher it should be flexible to use for anyone. AA is the WORST! Hope they go out of business for this nonsense. Airline travel is a joke."
Douglas of Yorba Linda, CA," March 6, 2015","American Airlines canceled my 92-year-old father-in-law's flight to Key West due to Hurricane Irma. On that day American Airline was contacted and the representative said there would be no problem re-booking, just use the reference number. American Airlines even went on TV and said they would waive re-booking fees. Today when calling to re-book the flight and after 57 minutes on the phone, I was told the flight could not be re-booked because it was in their notes I requested a refund. At no time did I request a refund and American Airlines could not locate any record of a refund request. Even so, American Airlines still insisted they could not re-book the flight or issue a refund. If we did not have enough trouble dealing with a Cat 4 hurricane and its devastating aftermath, now American Airlines is adding to the misery. All my father-in-law wants is to come to Key West and see that everyone is alright. Thanks, AA."
Cindy of Brandon, MS," March 6, 2015",I bought tickets for my mother in law and son to meet my wife and I in Colorado. We had traveled on different airlines due to connections and therefore were going back on different airlines. My wife and I left on our airplane. My mother in law and son were stranded as the plane had a mechanical. This was 8 AM and the bottom line was it didn't get fixed that day. American gave them a 12.00 voucher good in the terminal and did nothing to get them a room as the rooms they usually used weren't available.
DJ of Plano, TX," March 6, 2015","I booked 2 separate flights on American Airlines in Economy since I pay for my air travel. On one they pre-assigned me a back-of-plane middle seat and said that I was required to pay some increased fee for window, aisle or closer to the front. On the second flight they said I have to wait until I reach the boarding gate for any seat. This is ridiculous and unacceptable. The airline has sufficient revenue to - just a suggestion - increase the ""base"" fare to cover a first-come-first-served seat selection and not put everyone into 3rd class or worse status. If they want to surcharge certain premium seats, like middle seats toward the front, that's OK, but this behavior is totally unacceptable and I refuse to fly them (or any airline) that abuses their passengers."
brittany of Santa Cruz, CA," March 6, 2015",Well I looked into changing my flight for my fiance and I to go home a day earlier... only to discover that American charges $200.00 a ticket PLUS the difference in price tickets!

I have already paid for a flight and now you are trying to rip me off even more!?! Out of touch and terrible service to a customer of over 5 years. I will be going elsewhere where I don't get bent over the table. Thank you American!

Carla of Camby, IN," March 5, 2015",My husband and I were scheduled to fly out at 7:15 am to go to California for a very important family matter. We do not live near the airport so we were up early to make sure we were early and nothing could go wrong. But things did go wrong. When we got to the airport we went and printed out tickets at the self checkout. We did notice that it mentioned no overhead storage for our carry on bags. So confused because we fly a lot and there is always overhead storage or they place in under the cabin. So we asked a lady that was standing in the area of self print and she looked and our tickets said we would be fine... Again we were told wrong.
D of Seattle, WA," March 5, 2015","On September 4 my family of 5 arrived at the airport in Anchorage to fly home to Toronto via Dallas. Four of us had carry-on sized luggage but one had a mid-sized suitcase that we knew we would have to check. Our flight to Toronto included a 12.5-hour connection at DFW (not by choice). Since none of us sleep well on planes, we were considering going to a hotel following the overnight flight to DFW. When checking the suitcase, I specifically asked the American Airlines agent ""if we only check this bag to DFW and then go to a hotel for a few hours of sleep, will we be charged a second baggage fee to check the bag in for the flight to Toronto? If so we can rearrange the bags so that we can just check it through to Toronto."" "

I really only ever fly with AA as a last resort, and I can't see any reason to recommend traveling with AA. I was prior active duty Army, and now I'm a reservist, and only American Airlines makes me feel like my service is less important now. United, Southwest, Jet Blue, Delta, every other airline doesn't discriminate between Active Duty and Reserve/Guardsmen when it comes to bag fees. So, along with uncomfortable, outdated planes and poor service, I spent a $100 checking bags to and from my destination."
Irina of Brooklyn, NY," Feb. 27, 2015",American Airlines is the worst airlines to fly anywhere. They cram you in the seats with no leg room or any room for that matter. I requested a wheelchair at airport and waited 30 minutes upon someone finally arriving. They took me the wrong way to my next check in and I missed my flight. They said I would have to rebook my ticket and just wait for the next flight. Attendant at the gate was very disrespectful and not helpful at all. I had no control over this situation at all. Not to mention when I did finally arrive at my destination that I requested a wheelchair prior to my departure.
Erik of Venetia, PA," Feb. 26, 2015","American Airlines is the worst airline in THE WORLD, and should change their name, it is utterly disgraceful that as an American they use this name. Their policy is to not apologize for anything, to be as rude as possible to people who are basically held hostage to them and their BS policies like closing the door to the gate while people are standing there then charging them money to rebook their flight, not caring at all about the bags on their way to a destination without the owners there to pick them up. Then being told when lodging a complaint that it was going in one ear and out the other. I have never been treated so poorly in my life, I will never again fly with this airline, I hope they go bankrupt and get the worst karma life can give. Oh yeah and I get to fly with them tomorrow. :/"
monique of Hartford, CT," Feb. 26, 2015","Very disappointed. Unlikely I will ever choose American Airlines again. I didn't make my flight in the spring. I was given a voucher to use for future travel. Now I'm being told I can only use it myself, and not for my family. I don't want to use it for myself. What difference does it make? I'm being told different things by different people. The last guy hung up on me and I wasn't even rude to him. This is how AA does business? All I want is to not be penalized for cancelling a flight that was beyond my control. If you have a voucher it should be flexible to use for anyone. AA is the WORST! Hope they go out of business for this nonsense. Airline travel is a joke."
Ben of Nashville , TN," Feb. 26, 2015","American Airlines canceled my 92-year-old father-in-law's flight to Key West due to Hurricane Irma. On that day American Airline was contacted and the representative said there would be no problem re-booking, just use the reference number. American Airlines even went on TV and said they would waive re-booking fees. Today when calling to re-book the flight and after 57 minutes on the phone, I was told the flight could not be re-booked because it was in their notes I requested a refund. At no time did I request a refund and American Airlines could not locate any record of a refund request. Even so, American Airlines still insisted they could not re-book the flight or issue a refund. If we did not have enough trouble dealing with a Cat 4 hurricane and its devastating aftermath, now American Airlines is adding to the misery. All my father-in-law wants is to come to Key West and see that everyone is alright. Thanks, AA."
Lauren of Phoenixville, PA," Feb. 26, 2015",I bought tickets for my mother in law and son to meet my wife and I in Colorado. We had traveled on different airlines due to connections and therefore were going back on different airlines. My wife and I left on our airplane. My mother in law and son were stranded as the plane had a mechanical. This was 8 AM and the bottom line was it didn't get fixed that day. American gave them a 12.00 voucher good in the terminal and did nothing to get them a room as the rooms they usually used weren't available.
William of Bowling Green, KY," Feb. 26, 2015","I booked 2 separate flights on American Airlines in Economy since I pay for my air travel. On one they pre-assigned me a back-of-plane middle seat and said that I was required to pay some increased fee for window, aisle or closer to the front. On the second flight they said I have to wait until I reach the boarding gate for any seat. This is ridiculous and unacceptable. The airline has sufficient revenue to - just a suggestion - increase the ""base"" fare to cover a first-come-first-served seat selection and not put everyone into 3rd class or worse status. If they want to surcharge certain premium seats, like middle seats toward the front, that's OK, but this behavior is totally unacceptable and I refuse to fly them (or any airline) that abuses their passengers."
Vendetta of Huntington, IN," Feb. 25, 2015",Well I looked into changing my flight for my fiance and I to go home a day earlier... only to discover that American charges $200.00 a ticket PLUS the difference in price tickets! LIKE THAT IS GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE! So for the price of another ticket I can change my flight! I will be looking elsewhere for flights in the future. I have already paid for a flight and now you are trying to rip me off even more!?! Out of touch and terrible service to a customer of over 5 years. I will be going elsewhere where I don't get bent over the table. Thank you American!
Michael of New York, NY," Feb. 25, 2015","I originally booked my flight to Miami from Washington, DC back in July 2017. I was scheduled to fly September 13-18, 2017.

I was informed by two customer service representatives that I would be able to rebook my flight to Miami with no additional charges in fare and no change fees. Of course, when it comes time to book my flight, I'm informed about a change fee. I told the agent, I was reassured twice that I would not be charged any additional fees because my initial cancellation was weather related. "
Cheyenne of Kittery, ME," Feb. 23, 2015","American Airlines is full of **. Our cruise was cancelled due to Hurricane Irma. It was beyond our control and the airline stated there was nothing that they could do. No partial credit, changes or anything! I will not be flying with them anymore!"
Arnold of Mendota, VA," Feb. 23, 2015",My husband and I were scheduled to fly out at 7:15 am to go to California for a very important family matter. We do not live near the airport so we were up early to make sure we were early and nothing could go wrong. But things did go wrong. When we got to the airport we went and printed out tickets at the self checkout. We did notice that it mentioned no overhead storage for our carry on bags. So confused because we fly a lot and there is always overhead storage or they place in under the cabin. So we asked a lady that was standing in the area of self print and she looked and our tickets said we would be fine... Again we were told wrong.
jeff of Dallast, TX," Feb. 22, 2015","On September 4 my family of 5 arrived at the airport in Anchorage to fly home to Toronto via Dallas. Four of us had carry-on sized luggage but one had a mid-sized suitcase that we knew we would have to check. Our flight to Toronto included a 12.5-hour connection at DFW (not by choice). Since none of us sleep well on planes, we were considering going to a hotel following the overnight flight to DFW. When checking the suitcase, I specifically asked the American Airlines agent ""if we only check this bag to DFW and then go to a hotel for a few hours of sleep, will we be charged a second baggage fee to check the bag in for the flight to Toronto? If so we can rearrange the bags so that we can just check it through to Toronto."" "
Karla of East Northport, NY," Feb. 21, 2015","I purchased the basic economy ticket. When I was getting ready to board in Charlotte, the attendant mentioned that this was a new program for your airline and that customers have stated it was cost effective. However, this was not my case! I paid nearly $600 to fly from Columbus, OH to Asheville, NC. Absolutely absurd!!! In the future, I will do all I can to avoid flying with your airline and don't count on a positive recommendation from me to others! Also, stop charging for the first piece of checked in luggage!"

I called at night again because I was worried I saw it was still cancel. After almost 2 hours they answered the phone. I told them what happened. They told me that they were very sorry but the flight was canceled and they didnt' have flight for Sept 12. They gave me 1 stop flight for Sept 13. "
Tom of Des Moines, IA," Feb. 19, 2015","I was scheduled to fly out of Tampa International on Sunday, September, 17th to Durango, CO. I live in Sarasota, and just returned home the other day after evacuating for Hurricane Irma. I fled Florida and headed to Georgia, where I had to rent a hotel for a few nights. When I returned home I was fortunate enough not to have suffered damage. I of course have yard debris strewn about and I am still without power. The power company has estimated by the end of the day on September 22nd I will have power. With the extra costs incurred from having to leave my home, and the loss of power, I decided this was not a good time to travel."
Anosha of Springfield, MO," Feb. 18, 2015","Hurricane Irma was mess for AA. I get it. I'm sure there were thousands who were stuck trying to get their flights changed. Unfortunately, I was in Costa Rica with a connection via Miami and I got, as the AA agent said ""the short end of the stick."" I would be stuck almost another week in Costa Rica as everything AA had was booked out or cancelled. I saw a little bit of silver lining when I found that if I could get to Mexico city, I could fly home via DFW. However, AA would not change the ticket as it is against their rules to change the country of origin on a ticket. ""We cannot do it."" However, a more accurate description is ""will not."""
William of Tucson, AZ," Feb. 17, 2015","We were delayed on our AA out of Seattle due to having to wait on flight crew. Managed to make it to Dallas on time BUT had to sit on the tarmac for 20 mins waiting for a gait in order to deplane. This caused to miss our connecting flight. Next available flight is the next day. Asked about compensation for overnight hotel stay (there are 7 in our party, including a 3 year old) and were denied due to the delay being coded as weather related, which is absolutely bogus. So livid, frustrated, and tired at this point. Also found out AA has no number to call for complaints... You have to go through email so who knows if they will even read it or reply. Will never fly AA again if I can help it."
steven of Dearborn, MI," Feb. 17, 2015","I was on an almost 2 hour flight (Flight AA3936) stuck sitting with one leg over my bag and the other on the edge of the aisle. Not once was I asked to check in my bag nor told it wouldn't fit on the overhead bin. By the time we landed my knees, hips and back were killing me and I had to have help from the gentleman next to me to be able to stand up. So glad there wasn't an emergency 'cause this would have been one hell of a hazard. Lesson learned not to use this airline again."
Mark of Minneapolis, MN," Feb. 16, 2015","American Airlines‰Û_the new standard for horrible service. Oh‰Û_I mean HORRIBLE! I travel very frequently for work and have stuck to one specific airline in order to build my status with them (ie. first class upgrades often, better seat choices, free checked bags). Recently, service has taken a turn for the worse. I‰Ûªm a reasonable guy and tolerate more than most. Call it my Southern hospitality, my upbringing or my service to the community when I served in law enforcement, but I just plain put up with more‰Û_until now."
Pam of Los Angelas, CA," Feb. 14, 2015","I travel 80%~ for Work and have flown with almost every airline multiple times. AA is by far the worst. Not due to their customer service/staff/delays or anything like that (at least that I‰Ûªve noticed), but their planes have no entertainment system on each seat, they do not play movies on the overhead screens, and they don‰Ûªt even have a free WiFi movie/tv option you can connect to using your phone! I‰Ûªm currently on a flight from Boston to Phoenix and was utterly shocked when I sat in my seat and noticed no form of entertainment for a cross-country flight. Delta and other airlines provide personal entertainment screens on each screen or a smartphone connect feature for 2+ hr flights, which in turn make the flights more enjoyable. Anyways, to avoid rambling on and on about the lack of technology on AA planes I‰Ûªll just say if you enjoyed traveling in the late 90s early 2000s, then AA is for you. If you want to travel in 2017 and beyond, find a different airline."
Britt of Indian Land, SC," Feb. 12, 2015","I had a horrible experience today on my flight back to Miami. I have been an AAdvantage member for many years now and have always chosen to be loyal to American but after today's experience that may change. The onboarding process was fine and the flight was on time, which to be honest is rare but I was happy. When the snacks and beverage cart came the attendant did not smile, looked unhappy to take our beverage order, handed me and my husband 2 cookies, I then I told her, ""Can we just get pretzels?"" She said ""Then I need the cookies back."" I was honestly appalled."
Aditya of Gurgaon, Other," Feb. 10, 2015","Don't deserve single star. Also, I have a flight from Chicago to Minneapolis 5 hours from now. And they have seats available on the earlier flight but won't give you without charging $75. They are ok to make you wait or fly a flight with empty seats but no customer delight which is no cost to them. No customer driven company and not looking for going extra mile to make customer happy. Never travel on American Airlines again."
A of Austin, TX," Feb. 10, 2015","Worst experience ever with AA never again, they treated my dad like garbage, they humiliated my dad in front of my niece travelling with him and in front of all passengers, just because my dad is ** and not fluent in English. I wish I could sue them for discrimination against my dad for not speaking English fluent instead of offering assistance in Spanish which, the sky harbor airport in Arizona has plenty of bilingual employees. DO NOT FLY AA EVER, pay more with a different airline. The only reason why my dad and niece flew AA to go to my brother's funeral, thank you AA for the worst day ever. It's a shame I have to put a star instead of no stars service."
Aviram of Sea Cliff, NY," Feb. 8, 2015","This American Airlines review is out of frustration due to a lot of things. They're a disgrace! The employees are rude, there is no leg room, no entertainment, and treat people like herds of sheep. They have a ""New"" rule where they charge $50 at the gate to carry on your luggage. Are you kidding me? $50 for a carry on? And I can't even use the overhead bin! Disgraceful! Basically these guys are crooks! They're a disgrace. Last time I flew with American their flight was delayed by 2 hours and we ended up missing our connecting flight because it was the last flight out. We ended up having to stay an extra day and had to pay $100 for a hotel. We missed my sisters wedding. On the way back we ended up stuck on the tarmac for 2 hours. Of course!"
Burgess of Santa Clarita, CA," Feb. 6, 2015","I booked a ticket back when the hurricane were hitting down south every other week. Because of that I was not able to attend my trip in GA. They told me I had up to a year to use my ticket. So when I try to rebook my ticket they are now close to $500. Mind you this is the highest rate out of all the airlines for my particular dates, I asked for a refund because I didn't wanna double what I paid the first time and I was told by the Supervisor (Willie ** in Dallas ) that my only option was to ""use it or lost it"". Being a supervisor myself I thought the tone in which he said it was very careless and he didn't try to help the situation at all. I would never talk to my customers the way he spoke to me especially after losing out on $300!!"
Reilly of Bloomington, IN," Feb. 6, 2015","I just completed a flight on American Airlines. I had read negative reviews, but I found the American Airlines people I had contact with were great, tried to provide all the service they could because our flight had been cancelled due WX and had to layover at ORD. My complaint is the phoney coupon given for a hotel room for a ""discounted rate"". The coupon has nothing to do with American Airlines, but is only a hotel booking service. When I called the phone number provided I was told the only available room was 10 miles away and given a rate of $80.00. It was getting late in the evening so took it. Then was advised there was a $15 service charge to book the room. American Airline paid none of this. The shuttle bus to the hotel was packed (Other delayed passengers). When I got home I checked the hotel rate and found the same room went for $105. I ""saved"" $10. The hotel was a Holiday Inn Express. Room not bad."
Ray of Milwaukee, WI," Feb. 3, 2015","I was en route from San Antonio Texas to Hong Kong and when checking in for the domestic portion of the flight at the ticket counter, the woman claimed there was a problem with my passport. I asked for details and she claimed ""There are spots on your passport."" I told her the passport was still valid and did not expire until the following year."" She made up some baloney about Homeland Security not letting people fly with spots on their passport. I told her I checked their website and there was no mention of anything like that. She then claimed, ""Oh, they don't tell you."" I said, ""Then how are you supposed to know?""

While I was away, I heard the news that my dad had passed away. In which, I contacted American Airlines right away and asked if anything can be done. I wanted to fly back before my actual trip date, due to obvious reasons. I even offered to provide them with a death certificate if need be (although, I don't think that is even something they should ask for right away). I spoke to 3 different customer service reps who were all horrible to speak with. They had zero compassion and empathy and just dismissed me as if what I was experiencing was far from a big deal to them. "

Sanjaya of Melbourne, Other," Jan. 19, 2015","American Airlines‰Û_the new standard for horrible service. Oh‰Û_I mean HORRIBLE! I travel very frequently for work and have stuck to one specific airline in order to build my status with them (ie. first class upgrades often, better seat choices, free checked bags). Recently, service has taken a turn for the worse. I‰Ûªm a reasonable guy and tolerate more than most. Call it my Southern hospitality, my upbringing or my service to the community when I served in law enforcement, but I just plain put up with more‰Û_until now."
Pam of Richmond, TX," Jan. 18, 2015","I travel 80%~ for Work and have flown with almost every airline multiple times. AA is by far the worst. Not due to their customer service/staff/delays or anything like that (at least that I‰Ûªve noticed), but their planes have no entertainment system on each seat, they do not play movies on the overhead screens, and they don‰Ûªt even have a free WiFi movie/tv option you can connect to using your phone! I‰Ûªm currently on a flight from Boston to Phoenix and was utterly shocked when I sat in my seat and noticed no form of entertainment for a cross-country flight. Delta and other airlines provide personal entertainment screens on each screen or a smartphone connect feature for 2+ hr flights, which in turn make the flights more enjoyable. Anyways, to avoid rambling on and on about the lack of technology on AA planes I‰Ûªll just say if you enjoyed traveling in the late 90s early 2000s, then AA is for you. If you want to travel in 2017 and beyond, find a different airline."
Tiefu of San Jose, CA," Jan. 18, 2015","I had a horrible experience today on my flight back to Miami. I have been an AAdvantage member for many years now and have always chosen to be loyal to American but after today's experience that may change. The onboarding process was fine and the flight was on time, which to be honest is rare but I was happy. When the snacks and beverage cart came the attendant did not smile, looked unhappy to take our beverage order, handed me and my husband 2 cookies, I then I told her, ""Can we just get pretzels?"" She said ""Then I need the cookies back."" I was honestly appalled."
Magnolia of Phoenix, AR," Jan. 17, 2015","Don't deserve single star. Also, I have a flight from Chicago to Minneapolis 5 hours from now. And they have seats available on the earlier flight but won't give you without charging $75. They are ok to make you wait or fly a flight with empty seats but no customer delight which is no cost to them. No customer driven company and not looking for going extra mile to make customer happy. Never travel on American Airlines again."
Patti of Portsmouth, VA," Jan. 17, 2015","Worst experience ever with AA never again, they treated my dad like garbage, they humiliated my dad in front of my niece travelling with him and in front of all passengers, just because my dad is ** and not fluent in English. I wish I could sue them for discrimination against my dad for not speaking English fluent instead of offering assistance in Spanish which, the sky harbor airport in Arizona has plenty of bilingual employees. DO NOT FLY AA EVER, pay more with a different airline. The only reason why my dad and niece flew AA to go to my brother's funeral, thank you AA for the worst day ever. It's a shame I have to put a star instead of no stars service."
Jessica Ann of Antioch , CA," Jan. 16, 2015","This American Airlines review is out of frustration due to a lot of things. They're a disgrace! The employees are rude, there is no leg room, no entertainment, and treat people like herds of sheep. They have a ""New"" rule where they charge $50 at the gate to carry on your luggage. Are you kidding me? $50 for a carry on? And I can't even use the overhead bin! Disgraceful! Basically these guys are crooks! They're a disgrace. Last time I flew with American their flight was delayed by 2 hours and we ended up missing our connecting flight because it was the last flight out. We ended up having to stay an extra day and had to pay $100 for a hotel. We missed my sisters wedding. On the way back we ended up stuck on the tarmac for 2 hours. Of course!"
Zoe of Surry, ME," Jan. 15, 2015","I booked a ticket back when the hurricane were hitting down south every other week. Because of that I was not able to attend my trip in GA. They told me I had up to a year to use my ticket. So when I try to rebook my ticket they are now close to $500. Mind you this is the highest rate out of all the airlines for my particular dates, I asked for a refund because I didn't wanna double what I paid the first time and I was told by the Supervisor (Willie ** in Dallas ) that my only option was to ""use it or lost it"". Being a supervisor myself I thought the tone in which he said it was very careless and he didn't try to help the situation at all. I would never talk to my customers the way he spoke to me especially after losing out on $300!!"
Lesley of Leeds, Other," Jan. 15, 2015","I just completed a flight on American Airlines. I had read negative reviews, but I found the American Airlines people I had contact with were great, tried to provide all the service they could because our flight had been cancelled due WX and had to layover at ORD. My complaint is the phoney coupon given for a hotel room for a ""discounted rate"". The coupon has nothing to do with American Airlines, but is only a hotel booking service. When I called the phone number provided I was told the only available room was 10 miles away and given a rate of $80.00. It was getting late in the evening so took it. Then was advised there was a $15 service charge to book the room. American Airline paid none of this. The shuttle bus to the hotel was packed (Other delayed passengers). When I got home I checked the hotel rate and found the same room went for $105. I ""saved"" $10. The hotel was a Holiday Inn Express. Room not bad."

She made up some baloney about Homeland Security not letting people fly with spots on their passport. I told her I checked their website and there was no mention of anything like that. She then claimed, ""Oh, they don't tell you."" I said, ""Then how are you supposed to know?"" She then sarcastically claimed I needed glasses, so I put my glasses on and told her those so called spots are not a problem. "

I wanted to fly back before my actual trip date, due to obvious reasons. I even offered to provide them with a death certificate if need be (although, I don't think that is even something they should ask for right away). I spoke to 3 different customer service reps who were all horrible to speak with. They had zero compassion and empathy and just dismissed me as if what I was experiencing was far from a big deal to them. "
Isobel of Berwyn, PA," Jan. 9, 2015","I was on the plane for 14 hours due to a delay. Sitting in a broken seat that would not recline. I told the stewardess and she could care less, said nothing she can do. After I got home I contacted the airline and they issued me a fourteen dollar credit. I had paid 197.34 dollars for preferred seats. The worst flight of my life, never again w/ this airline."
jie of Fairfax Station, VA," Jan. 8, 2015","Overall, (Un)American Airlines continues to disappoint. I really only ever fly with AA as a last resort, and I can't see any reason to recommend traveling with AA. I was prior active duty Army, and now I'm a reservist, and only American Airlines makes me feel like my service is less important now. United, Southwest, Jet Blue, Delta, every other airline doesn't discriminate between Active Duty and Reserve/Guardsmen when it comes to bag fees. So, along with uncomfortable, outdated planes and poor service, I spent a $100 checking bags to and from my destination."
shiek of St Cloud, MN," Jan. 8, 2015",American Airlines is the worst airlines to fly anywhere. They cram you in the seats with no leg room or any room for that matter. I requested a wheelchair at airport and waited 30 minutes upon someone finally arriving. They took me the wrong way to my next check in and I missed my flight. They said I would have to rebook my ticket and just wait for the next flight. Attendant at the gate was very disrespectful and not helpful at all. I had no control over this situation at all. Not to mention when I did finally arrive at my destination that I requested a wheelchair prior to my departure.
brandi of Bakersfield, CA," Jan. 8, 2015","American Airlines is the worst airline in THE WORLD, and should change their name, it is utterly disgraceful that as an American they use this name. Their policy is to not apologize for anything, to be as rude as possible to people who are basically held hostage to them and their BS policies like closing the door to the gate while people are standing there then charging them money to rebook their flight, not caring at all about the bags on their way to a destination without the owners there to pick them up. Then being told when lodging a complaint that it was going in one ear and out the other. I have never been treated so poorly in my life, I will never again fly with this airline, I hope they go bankrupt and get the worst karma life can give. Oh yeah and I get to fly with them tomorrow. :/"
Samia of Brooklyn, NY," Jan. 8, 2015","Very disappointed. Unlikely I will ever choose American Airlines again. I didn't make my flight in the spring. I was given a voucher to use for future travel. Now I'm being told I can only use it myself, and not for my family. I don't want to use it for myself. What difference does it make? I'm being told different things by different people. The last guy hung up on me and I wasn't even rude to him. This is how AA does business? All I want is to not be penalized for cancelling a flight that was beyond my control. If you have a voucher it should be flexible to use for anyone. AA is the WORST! Hope they go out of business for this nonsense. Airline travel is a joke."
Mauro of Orlando, FL," Jan. 6, 2015","American Airlines canceled my 92-year-old father-in-law's flight to Key West due to Hurricane Irma. On that day American Airline was contacted and the representative said there would be no problem re-booking, just use the reference number. American Airlines even went on TV and said they would waive re-booking fees. Today when calling to re-book the flight and after 57 minutes on the phone, I was told the flight could not be re-booked because it was in their notes I requested a refund. At no time did I request a refund and American Airlines could not locate any record of a refund request. Even so, American Airlines still insisted they could not re-book the flight or issue a refund. If we did not have enough trouble dealing with a Cat 4 hurricane and its devastating aftermath, now American Airlines is adding to the misery. All my father-in-law wants is to come to Key West and see that everyone is alright. Thanks, AA."
Beth of Saint Paul, MN," Jan. 6, 2015",I bought tickets for my mother in law and son to meet my wife and I in Colorado. We had traveled on different airlines due to connections and therefore were going back on different airlines. My wife and I left on our airplane. My mother in law and son were stranded as the plane had a mechanical. This was 8 AM and the bottom line was it didn't get fixed that day. American gave them a 12.00 voucher good in the terminal and did nothing to get them a room as the rooms they usually used weren't available.
Christian of Miami Lakes, FL," Jan. 6, 2015","I booked 2 separate flights on American Airlines in Economy since I pay for my air travel. On one they pre-assigned me a back-of-plane middle seat and said that I was required to pay some increased fee for window, aisle or closer to the front. On the second flight they said I have to wait until I reach the boarding gate for any seat. This is ridiculous and unacceptable. The airline has sufficient revenue to - just a suggestion - increase the ""base"" fare to cover a first-come-first-served seat selection and not put everyone into 3rd class or worse status. If they want to surcharge certain premium seats, like middle seats toward the front, that's OK, but this behavior is totally unacceptable and I refuse to fly them (or any airline) that abuses their passengers."
Nima of Hackensack, NJ," Jan. 5, 2015",Well I looked into changing my flight for my fiance and I to go home a day earlier... only to discover that American charges $200.00 a ticket PLUS the difference in price tickets! LIKE THAT IS GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE! So for the price of another ticket I can change my flight! I will be looking elsewhere for flights in the future. I have already paid for a flight and now you are trying to rip me off even more!?! Out of touch and terrible service to a customer of over 5 years. I will be going elsewhere where I don't get bent over the table. Thank you American!

I, like many, had to cancel my trip because of hurricane Irma. I was informed by two customer service representatives that I would be able to rebook my flight to Miami with no additional charges in fare and no change fees. Of course, when it comes time to book my flight, I'm informed about a change fee. I told the agent, I was reassured twice that I would not be charged any additional fees because my initial cancellation was weather related. "
Trina of Halifax, NS," Jan. 3, 2015","American Airlines is full of **. Our cruise was cancelled due to Hurricane Irma. It was beyond our control and the airline stated there was nothing that they could do. No partial credit, changes or anything! I will not be flying with them anymore!"
Silvana of Lutz, FL," Jan. 2, 2015",My husband and I were scheduled to fly out at 7:15 am to go to California for a very important family matter. We do not live near the airport so we were up early to make sure we were early and nothing could go wrong. But things did go wrong. When we got to the airport we went and printed out tickets at the self checkout. We did notice that it mentioned no overhead storage for our carry on bags. So confused because we fly a lot and there is always overhead storage or they place in under the cabin. So we asked a lady that was standing in the area of self print and she looked and our tickets said we would be fine... Again we were told wrong.
Cassandra of Vacherie, LA," Jan. 2, 2015","On September 4 my family of 5 arrived at the airport in Anchorage to fly home to Toronto via Dallas. Four of us had carry-on sized luggage but one had a mid-sized suitcase that we knew we would have to check. Our flight to Toronto included a 12.5-hour connection at DFW (not by choice). Since none of us sleep well on planes, we were considering going to a hotel following the overnight flight to DFW. When checking the suitcase, I specifically asked the American Airlines agent ""if we only check this bag to DFW and then go to a hotel for a few hours of sleep, will we be charged a second baggage fee to check the bag in for the flight to Toronto? If so we can rearrange the bags so that we can just check it through to Toronto."" "

However, this was not my case! I paid nearly $600 to fly from Columbus, OH to Asheville, NC. Absolutely absurd!!! In the future, I will do all I can to avoid flying with your airline and don't count on a positive recommendation from me to others! Also, stop charging for the first piece of checked in luggage!"

I called at night again because I was worried I saw it was still cancel. After almost 2 hours they answered the phone. I told them what happened. They told me that they were very sorry but the flight was canceled and they didnt' have flight for Sept 12. They gave me 1 stop flight for Sept 13. "
J of Huntington, WV," Jan. 1, 2015","I was scheduled to fly out of Tampa International on Sunday, September, 17th to Durango, CO. I live in Sarasota, and just returned home the other day after evacuating for Hurricane Irma. I fled Florida and headed to Georgia, where I had to rent a hotel for a few nights. When I returned home I was fortunate enough not to have suffered damage. I of course have yard debris strewn about and I am still without power. The power company has estimated by the end of the day on September 22nd I will have power. With the extra costs incurred from having to leave my home, and the loss of power, I decided this was not a good time to travel."
James of Boston, MA," Dec. 31, 2014","Hurricane Irma was mess for AA. I get it. I'm sure there were thousands who were stuck trying to get their flights changed. Unfortunately, I was in Costa Rica with a connection via Miami and I got, as the AA agent said ""the short end of the stick."" I would be stuck almost another week in Costa Rica as everything AA had was booked out or cancelled. I saw a little bit of silver lining when I found that if I could get to Mexico city, I could fly home via DFW. However, AA would not change the ticket as it is against their rules to change the country of origin on a ticket. ""We cannot do it."" However, a more accurate description is ""will not."""
Pat of X, FL," Dec. 30, 2014","We were delayed on our AA out of Seattle due to having to wait on flight crew. Managed to make it to Dallas on time BUT had to sit on the tarmac for 20 mins waiting for a gait in order to deplane. This caused to miss our connecting flight. Next available flight is the next day. Asked about compensation for overnight hotel stay (there are 7 in our party, including a 3 year old) and were denied due to the delay being coded as weather related, which is absolutely bogus. So livid, frustrated, and tired at this point. Also found out AA has no number to call for complaints... You have to go through email so who knows if they will even read it or reply. Will never fly AA again if I can help it."

If we did not have enough trouble dealing with a Cat 4 hurricane and its devastating aftermath, now American Airlines is adding to the misery. All my father-in-law wants is to come to Key West and see that everyone is alright. Thanks, AA."
Jessica of Paris, Other," Dec. 8, 2014",I bought tickets for my mother in law and son to meet my wife and I in Colorado. We had traveled on different airlines due to connections and therefore were going back on different airlines. My wife and I left on our airplane. My mother in law and son were stranded as the plane had a mechanical. This was 8 AM and the bottom line was it didn't get fixed that day. American gave them a 12.00 voucher good in the terminal and did nothing to get them a room as the rooms they usually used weren't available.
todd of Holyoke, MA," Dec. 7, 2014","I booked 2 separate flights on American Airlines in Economy since I pay for my air travel. On one they pre-assigned me a back-of-plane middle seat and said that I was required to pay some increased fee for window, aisle or closer to the front. On the second flight they said I have to wait until I reach the boarding gate for any seat. This is ridiculous and unacceptable. The airline has sufficient revenue to - just a suggestion - increase the ""base"" fare to cover a first-come-first-served seat selection and not put everyone into 3rd class or worse status. If they want to surcharge certain premium seats, like middle seats toward the front, that's OK, but this behavior is totally unacceptable and I refuse to fly them (or any airline) that abuses their passengers."
Cathy of Bristol , VA," Dec. 4, 2014",Well I looked into changing my flight for my fiance and I to go home a day earlier... only to discover that American charges $200.00 a ticket PLUS the difference in price tickets! LIKE THAT IS GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE! So for the price of another ticket I can change my flight! I will be looking elsewhere for flights in the future. I have already paid for a flight and now you are trying to rip me off even more!?! Out of touch and terrible service to a customer of over 5 years. I will be going elsewhere where I don't get bent over the table. Thank you American!
Karen of Anchorage, AK," Dec. 4, 2014","I originally booked my flight to Miami from Washington, DC back in July 2017. I was scheduled to fly September 13-18, 2017. I, like many, had to cancel my trip because of hurricane Irma. I was informed by two customer service representatives that I would be able to rebook my flight to Miami with no additional charges in fare and no change fees. Of course, when it comes time to book my flight, I'm informed about a change fee. I told the agent, I was reassured twice that I would not be charged any additional fees because my initial cancellation was weather related. "
youssef of Tarrant, AL," Nov. 30, 2014","American Airlines is full of **. Our cruise was cancelled due to Hurricane Irma. It was beyond our control and the airline stated there was nothing that they could do. No partial credit, changes or anything! I will not be flying with them anymore!"
Shun of Balitmore, MD," Nov. 29, 2014",My husband and I were scheduled to fly out at 7:15 am to go to California for a very important family matter. We do not live near the airport so we were up early to make sure we were early and nothing could go wrong. But things did go wrong. When we got to the airport we went and printed out tickets at the self checkout. We did notice that it mentioned no overhead storage for our carry on bags. So confused because we fly a lot and there is always overhead storage or they place in under the cabin. So we asked a lady that was standing in the area of self print and she looked and our tickets said we would be fine... Again we were told wrong.
Diana of New Fairfield, CT," Nov. 26, 2014","On September 4 my family of 5 arrived at the airport in Anchorage to fly home to Toronto via Dallas. Four of us had carry-on sized luggage but one had a mid-sized suitcase that we knew we would have to check. Our flight to Toronto included a 12.5-hour connection at DFW (not by choice). Since none of us sleep well on planes, we were considering going to a hotel following the overnight flight to DFW. When checking the suitcase, I specifically asked the American Airlines agent ""if we only check this bag to DFW and then go to a hotel for a few hours of sleep, will we be charged a second baggage fee to check the bag in for the flight to Toronto? If so we can rearrange the bags so that we can just check it through to Toronto."" "

When I was getting ready to board in Charlotte, the attendant mentioned that this was a new program for your airline and that customers have stated it was cost effective. However, this was not my case! I paid nearly $600 to fly from Columbus, OH to Asheville, NC. Absolutely absurd!!! In the future, I will do all I can to avoid flying with your airline and don't count on a positive recommendation from me to others! Also, stop charging for the first piece of checked in luggage!"

I called at night again because I was worried I saw it was still cancel. After almost 2 hours they answered the phone. I told them what happened. They told me that they were very sorry but the flight was canceled and they didnt' have flight for Sept 12. They gave me 1 stop flight for Sept 13. "
Connie of Hemphill, TX," Nov. 22, 2014","I was scheduled to fly out of Tampa International on Sunday, September, 17th to Durango, CO. I live in Sarasota, and just returned home the other day after evacuating for Hurricane Irma. I fled Florida and headed to Georgia, where I had to rent a hotel for a few nights. When I returned home I was fortunate enough not to have suffered damage. I of course have yard debris strewn about and I am still without power. The power company has estimated by the end of the day on September 22nd I will have power. With the extra costs incurred from having to leave my home, and the loss of power, I decided this was not a good time to travel."
Rob of Daphne, AL," Nov. 22, 2014","Hurricane Irma was mess for AA. I get it. I'm sure there were thousands who were stuck trying to get their flights changed. Unfortunately, I was in Costa Rica with a connection via Miami and I got, as the AA agent said ""the short end of the stick."" I would be stuck almost another week in Costa Rica as everything AA had was booked out or cancelled. I saw a little bit of silver lining when I found that if I could get to Mexico city, I could fly home via DFW. However, AA would not change the ticket as it is against their rules to change the country of origin on a ticket. ""We cannot do it."" However, a more accurate description is ""will not."""
aaron of Portland, OR," Nov. 21, 2014","We were delayed on our AA out of Seattle due to having to wait on flight crew. Managed to make it to Dallas on time BUT had to sit on the tarmac for 20 mins waiting for a gait in order to deplane. This caused to miss our connecting flight. Next available flight is the next day. Asked about compensation for overnight hotel stay (there are 7 in our party, including a 3 year old) and were denied due to the delay being coded as weather related, which is absolutely bogus. So livid, frustrated, and tired at this point. Also found out AA has no number to call for complaints... You have to go through email so who knows if they will even read it or reply. Will never fly AA again if I can help it."
Amanda of Cortlandt Manor, NY," Nov. 19, 2014","I was on an almost 2 hour flight (Flight AA3936) stuck sitting with one leg over my bag and the other on the edge of the aisle. Not once was I asked to check in my bag nor told it wouldn't fit on the overhead bin. By the time we landed my knees, hips and back were killing me and I had to have help from the gentleman next to me to be able to stand up. So glad there wasn't an emergency 'cause this would have been one hell of a hazard. Lesson learned not to use this airline again."
Luis of San Antonio, TX," Nov. 18, 2014","American Airlines‰Û_the new standard for horrible service. Oh‰Û_I mean HORRIBLE! I travel very frequently for work and have stuck to one specific airline in order to build my status with them (ie. first class upgrades often, better seat choices, free checked bags). Recently, service has taken a turn for the worse. I‰Ûªm a reasonable guy and tolerate more than most.

Martin of Westlake Village, CA," Nov. 17, 2014","I travel 80%~ for Work and have flown with almost every airline multiple times. AA is by far the worst. Not due to their customer service/staff/delays or anything like that (at least that I‰Ûªve noticed), but their planes have no entertainment system on each seat, they do not play movies on the overhead screens, and they don‰Ûªt even have a free WiFi movie/tv option you can connect to using your phone! I‰Ûªm currently on a flight from Boston to Phoenix and was utterly shocked when I sat in my seat and noticed no form of entertainment for a cross-country flight. Delta and other airlines provide personal entertainment screens on each screen or a smartphone connect feature for 2+ hr flights, which in turn make the flights more enjoyable. Anyways, to avoid rambling on and on about the lack of technology on AA planes I‰Ûªll just say if you enjoyed traveling in the late 90s early 2000s, then AA is for you. If you want to travel in 2017 and beyond, find a different airline."
Terry of Canyon Lake, CA," Nov. 15, 2014","I had a horrible experience today on my flight back to Miami. I have been an AAdvantage member for many years now and have always chosen to be loyal to American but after today's experience that may change. The onboarding process was fine and the flight was on time, which to be honest is rare but I was happy. When the snacks and beverage cart came the attendant did not smile, looked unhappy to take our beverage order, handed me and my husband 2 cookies, I then I told her, ""Can we just get pretzels?"" She said ""Then I need the cookies back."" I was honestly appalled."
scott of Egg Harbor Township, NJ," Nov. 14, 2014","Don't deserve single star. Also, I have a flight from Chicago to Minneapolis 5 hours from now. And they have seats available on the earlier flight but won't give you without charging $75. They are ok to make you wait or fly a flight with empty seats but no customer delight which is no cost to them. No customer driven company and not looking for going extra mile to make customer happy. Never travel on American Airlines again."
Edlira of Worcester, MA," Nov. 13, 2014","Worst experience ever with AA never again, they treated my dad like garbage, they humiliated my dad in front of my niece travelling with him and in front of all passengers, just because my dad is ** and not fluent in English. I wish I could sue them for discrimination against my dad for not speaking English fluent instead of offering assistance in Spanish which, the sky harbor airport in Arizona has plenty of bilingual employees. DO NOT FLY AA EVER, pay more with a different airline. The only reason why my dad and niece flew AA to go to my brother's funeral, thank you AA for the worst day ever. It's a shame I have to put a star instead of no stars service."
Tammy of Georgetown, TX," Nov. 12, 2014","This American Airlines review is out of frustration due to a lot of things. They're a disgrace! The employees are rude, there is no leg room, no entertainment, and treat people like herds of sheep. They have a ""New"" rule where they charge $50 at the gate to carry on your luggage. Are you kidding me? $50 for a carry on? And I can't even use the overhead bin! Disgraceful! Basically these guys are crooks! They're a disgrace. Last time I flew with American their flight was delayed by 2 hours and we ended up missing our connecting flight because it was the last flight out. We ended up having to stay an extra day and had to pay $100 for a hotel. We missed my sisters wedding. On the way back we ended up stuck on the tarmac for 2 hours. Of course!"
Katrina of Casselberry, FL," Nov. 10, 2014","I booked a ticket back when the hurricane were hitting down south every other week. Because of that I was not able to attend my trip in GA. They told me I had up to a year to use my ticket. So when I try to rebook my ticket they are now close to $500. Mind you this is the highest rate out of all the airlines for my particular dates, I asked for a refund because I didn't wanna double what I paid the first time and I was told by the Supervisor (Willie ** in Dallas ) that my only option was to ""use it or lost it"". Being a supervisor myself I thought the tone in which he said it was very careless and he didn't try to help the situation at all. I would never talk to my customers the way he spoke to me especially after losing out on $300!!"
Louis of Ellicott City, MD," Nov. 10, 2014","I just completed a flight on American Airlines. I had read negative reviews, but I found the American Airlines people I had contact with were great, tried to provide all the service they could because our flight had been cancelled due WX and had to layover at ORD. My complaint is the phoney coupon given for a hotel room for a ""discounted rate"". The coupon has nothing to do with American Airlines, but is only a hotel booking service. When I called the phone number provided I was told the only available room was 10 miles away and given a rate of $80.00. It was getting late in the evening so took it. Then was advised there was a $15 service charge to book the room. American Airline paid none of this. The shuttle bus to the hotel was packed (Other delayed passengers). When I got home I checked the hotel rate and found the same room went for $105. I ""saved"" $10. The hotel was a Holiday Inn Express. Room not bad."
S of Connelly Springs, NC," Nov. 7, 2014","I was en route from San Antonio Texas to Hong Kong and when checking in for the domestic portion of the flight at the ticket counter, the woman claimed there was a problem with my passport. I asked for details and she claimed ""There are spots on your passport."" I told her the passport was still valid and did not expire until the following year."" She made up some baloney about Homeland Security not letting people fly with spots on their passport. I told her I checked their website and there was no mention of anything like that. She then claimed, ""Oh, they don't tell you."" I said, ""Then how are you supposed to know?"" She then sarcastically claimed I needed glasses, so I put my glasses on and told her those so called spots are not a problem. "

Jennifer of Bainbridge Island, WA," Nov. 7, 2014","Where do I even begin? I had a round trip flight booked from Toronto, Ontario to Busan, South Korea back in the month of July (2017). While I was away, I heard the news that my dad had passed away. In which, I contacted American Airlines right away and asked if anything can be done. I wanted to fly back before my actual trip date, due to obvious reasons. I even offered to provide them with a death certificate if need be (although, I don't think that is even something they should ask for right away). I spoke to 3 different customer service reps who were all horrible to speak with. They had zero compassion and empathy and just dismissed me as if what I was experiencing was far from a big deal to them. "
Michele of Comerville, ME," Nov. 4, 2014","I was on the plane for 14 hours due to a delay. Sitting in a broken seat that would not recline. I told the stewardess and she could care less, said nothing she can do. After I got home I contacted the airline and they issued me a fourteen dollar credit. I had paid 197.34 dollars for preferred seats. The worst flight of my life, never again w/ this airline."
Richelle of Ashland City, TN," Nov. 4, 2014","Overall, (Un)American Airlines continues to disappoint. I really only ever fly with AA as a last resort, and I can't see any reason to recommend traveling with AA. I was prior active duty Army, and now I'm a reservist, and only American Airlines makes me feel like my service is less important now. United, Southwest, Jet Blue, Delta, every other airline doesn't discriminate between Active Duty and Reserve/Guardsmen when it comes to bag fees. So, along with uncomfortable, outdated planes and poor service, I spent a $100 checking bags to and from my destination."
Nicole of Orlando, FL," Nov. 4, 2014",American Airlines is the worst airlines to fly anywhere. They cram you in the seats with no leg room or any room for that matter. I requested a wheelchair at airport and waited 30 minutes upon someone finally arriving. They took me the wrong way to my next check in and I missed my flight. They said I would have to rebook my ticket and just wait for the next flight. Attendant at the gate was very disrespectful and not helpful at all. I had no control over this situation at all. Not to mention when I did finally arrive at my destination that I requested a wheelchair prior to my departure.
Thomas of Denver , CO," Nov. 4, 2014","American Airlines is the worst airline in THE WORLD, and should change their name, it is utterly disgraceful that as an American they use this name. Their policy is to not apologize for anything, to be as rude as possible to people who are basically held hostage to them and their BS policies like closing the door to the gate while people are standing there then charging them money to rebook their flight, not caring at all about the bags on their way to a destination without the owners there to pick them up. Then being told when lodging a complaint that it was going in one ear and out the other. I have never been treated so poorly in my life, I will never again fly with this airline, I hope they go bankrupt and get the worst karma life can give. Oh yeah and I get to fly with them tomorrow. :/"
Roger of Roanoke, VA," Nov. 2, 2014","Very disappointed. Unlikely I will ever choose American Airlines again. I didn't make my flight in the spring. I was given a voucher to use for future travel. Now I'm being told I can only use it myself, and not for my family. I don't want to use it for myself. What difference does it make? I'm being told different things by different people. The last guy hung up on me and I wasn't even rude to him. This is how AA does business? All I want is to not be penalized for cancelling a flight that was beyond my control. If you have a voucher it should be flexible to use for anyone. AA is the WORST! Hope they go out of business for this nonsense. Airline travel is a joke."
WALLY of Oakland Township, MI," Oct. 26, 2014","American Airlines canceled my 92-year-old father-in-law's flight to Key West due to Hurricane Irma. On that day American Airline was contacted and the representative said there would be no problem re-booking, just use the reference number. American Airlines even went on TV and said they would waive re-booking fees. Today when calling to re-book the flight and after 57 minutes on the phone, I was told the flight could not be re-booked because it was in their notes I requested a refund.

It's a shame I have to put a star instead of no stars service."
Charlotte of Memphis, TN," Oct. 6, 2014","This American Airlines review is out of frustration due to a lot of things. They're a disgrace! The employees are rude, there is no leg room, no entertainment, and treat people like herds of sheep. They have a ""New"" rule where they charge $50 at the gate to carry on your luggage. Are you kidding me? $50 for a carry on? And I can't even use the overhead bin! Disgraceful! Basically these guys are crooks! They're a disgrace. Last time I flew with American their flight was delayed by 2 hours and we ended up missing our connecting flight because it was the last flight out. We ended up having to stay an extra day and had to pay $100 for a hotel. We missed my sisters wedding. On the way back we ended up stuck on the tarmac for 2 hours. Of course!"
Shawn of Mckinney, TX," Oct. 3, 2014","I booked a ticket back when the hurricane were hitting down south every other week. Because of that I was not able to attend my trip in GA. They told me I had up to a year to use my ticket. So when I try to rebook my ticket they are now close to $500. Mind you this is the highest rate out of all the airlines for my particular dates, I asked for a refund because I didn't wanna double what I paid the first time and I was told by the Supervisor (Willie ** in Dallas ) that my only option was to ""use it or lost it"". Being a supervisor myself I thought the tone in which he said it was very careless and he didn't try to help the situation at all. I would never talk to my customers the way he spoke to me especially after losing out on $300!!"
Joylynn of San Jose, CA," Sept. 30, 2014","I just completed a flight on American Airlines. I had read negative reviews, but I found the American Airlines people I had contact with were great, tried to provide all the service they could because our flight had been cancelled due WX and had to layover at ORD. My complaint is the phoney coupon given for a hotel room for a ""discounted rate"". The coupon has nothing to do with American Airlines, but is only a hotel booking service. When I called the phone number provided I was told the only available room was 10 miles away and given a rate of $80.00. It was getting late in the evening so took it. Then was advised there was a $15 service charge to book the room. American Airline paid none of this. The shuttle bus to the hotel was packed (Other delayed passengers). When I got home I checked the hotel rate and found the same room went for $105. I ""saved"" $10. The hotel was a Holiday Inn Express. Room not bad."
Richard of Aliso Viejo, CA," Sept. 27, 2014","I was en route from San Antonio Texas to Hong Kong and when checking in for the domestic portion of the flight at the ticket counter, the woman claimed there was a problem with my passport. I asked for details and she claimed ""There are spots on your passport."" I told her the passport was still valid and did not expire until the following year."" She made up some baloney about Homeland Security not letting people fly with spots on their passport. I told her I checked their website and there was no mention of anything like that. She then claimed, ""Oh, they don't tell you."" I said, ""Then how are you supposed to know?"" She then sarcastically claimed I needed glasses, so I put my glasses on and told her those so called spots are not a problem. "

While I was away, I heard the news that my dad had passed away. In which, I contacted American Airlines right away and asked if anything can be done. I wanted to fly back before my actual trip date, due to obvious reasons. I even offered to provide them with a death certificate if need be (although, I don't think that is even something they should ask for right away). I spoke to 3 different customer service reps who were all horrible to speak with. They had zero compassion and empathy and just dismissed me as if what I was experiencing was far from a big deal to them. "
Sandy of Cockeysville, MD," Sept. 23, 2014","I was on the plane for 14 hours due to a delay. Sitting in a broken seat that would not recline. I told the stewardess and she could care less, said nothing she can do. After I got home I contacted the airline and they issued me a fourteen dollar credit. I had paid 197.34 dollars for preferred seats. The worst flight of my life, never again w/ this airline."
C of Everett, WA," Sept. 20, 2014","Overall, (Un)American Airlines continues to disappoint. I really only ever fly with AA as a last resort, and I can't see any reason to recommend traveling with AA. I was prior active duty Army, and now I'm a reservist, and only American Airlines makes me feel like my service is less important now. United, Southwest, Jet Blue, Delta, every other airline doesn't discriminate between Active Duty and Reserve/Guardsmen when it comes to bag fees. So, along with uncomfortable, outdated planes and poor service, I spent a $100 checking bags to and from my destination."
Susan of Kalamazoo , MI," Sept. 18, 2014",American Airlines is the worst airlines to fly anywhere. They cram you in the seats with no leg room or any room for that matter. I requested a wheelchair at airport and waited 30 minutes upon someone finally arriving. They took me the wrong way to my next check in and I missed my flight. They said I would have to rebook my ticket and just wait for the next flight. Attendant at the gate was very disrespectful and not helpful at all. I had no control over this situation at all. Not to mention when I did finally arrive at my destination that I requested a wheelchair prior to my departure.
Heidi of West Burlington, IA," Sept. 18, 2014","American Airlines is the worst airline in THE WORLD, and should change their name, it is utterly disgraceful that as an American they use this name. Their policy is to not apologize for anything, to be as rude as possible to people who are basically held hostage to them and their BS policies like closing the door to the gate while people are standing there then charging them money to rebook their flight, not caring at all about the bags on their way to a destination without the owners there to pick them up. Then being told when lodging a complaint that it was going in one ear and out the other. I have never been treated so poorly in my life, I will never again fly with this airline, I hope they go bankrupt and get the worst karma life can give. Oh yeah and I get to fly with them tomorrow. :/"
abhishek of Ahmedabad Gujarat, Other," Sept. 16, 2014","Very disappointed. Unlikely I will ever choose American Airlines again. I didn't make my flight in the spring. I was given a voucher to use for future travel. Now I'm being told I can only use it myself, and not for my family. I don't want to use it for myself. What difference does it make? I'm being told different things by different people. The last guy hung up on me and I wasn't even rude to him. This is how AA does business? All I want is to not be penalized for cancelling a flight that was beyond my control. If you have a voucher it should be flexible to use for anyone. AA is the WORST! Hope they go out of business for this nonsense. Airline travel is a joke."
Selina of Walpole, MA," Sept. 13, 2014","American Airlines canceled my 92-year-old father-in-law's flight to Key West due to Hurricane Irma. On that day American Airline was contacted and the representative said there would be no problem re-booking, just use the reference number. American Airlines even went on TV and said they would waive re-booking fees. Today when calling to re-book the flight and after 57 minutes on the phone, I was told the flight could not be re-booked because it was in their notes I requested a refund. At no time did I request a refund and American Airlines could not locate any record of a refund request. Even so, American Airlines still insisted they could not re-book the flight or issue a refund. If we did not have enough trouble dealing with a Cat 4 hurricane and its devastating aftermath, now American Airlines is adding to the misery. All my father-in-law wants is to come to Key West and see that everyone is alright. Thanks, AA."
Hyung of Sunnyvale, CA," Sept. 11, 2014",I bought tickets for my mother in law and son to meet my wife and I in Colorado. We had traveled on different airlines due to connections and therefore were going back on different airlines. My wife and I left on our airplane. My mother in law and son were stranded as the plane had a mechanical. This was 8 AM and the bottom line was it didn't get fixed that day. American gave them a 12.00 voucher good in the terminal and did nothing to get them a room as the rooms they usually used weren't available.
June of Redwater, TX," Sept. 11, 2014","I booked 2 separate flights on American Airlines in Economy since I pay for my air travel. On one they pre-assigned me a back-of-plane middle seat and said that I was required to pay some increased fee for window, aisle or closer to the front. On the second flight they said I have to wait until I reach the boarding gate for any seat. This is ridiculous and unacceptable. The airline has sufficient revenue to - just a suggestion - increase the ""base"" fare to cover a first-come-first-served seat selection and not put everyone into 3rd class or worse status. If they want to surcharge certain premium seats, like middle seats toward the front, that's OK, but this behavior is totally unacceptable and I refuse to fly them (or any airline) that abuses their passengers."
Andre  of New York, NY," Sept. 10, 2014",Well I looked into changing my flight for my fiance and I to go home a day earlier... only to discover that American charges $200.00 a ticket PLUS the difference in price tickets! LIKE THAT IS GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE! So for the price of another ticket I can change my flight! I will be looking elsewhere for flights in the future. I have already paid for a flight and now you are trying to rip me off even more!?! Out of touch and terrible service to a customer of over 5 years. I will be going elsewhere where I don't get bent over the table. Thank you American!

I was informed by two customer service representatives that I would be able to rebook my flight to Miami with no additional charges in fare and no change fees. Of course, when it comes time to book my flight, I'm informed about a change fee. I told the agent, I was reassured twice that I would not be charged any additional fees because my initial cancellation was weather related. "
Rajinie of Richmond Hill, ON," Sept. 4, 2014","American Airlines is full of **. Our cruise was cancelled due to Hurricane Irma. It was beyond our control and the airline stated there was nothing that they could do. No partial credit, changes or anything! I will not be flying with them anymore!"
Greta of Palos Hills, IL," Sept. 2, 2014",My husband and I were scheduled to fly out at 7:15 am to go to California for a very important family matter. We do not live near the airport so we were up early to make sure we were early and nothing could go wrong. But things did go wrong. When we got to the airport we went and printed out tickets at the self checkout. We did notice that it mentioned no overhead storage for our carry on bags. So confused because we fly a lot and there is always overhead storage or they place in under the cabin. So we asked a lady that was standing in the area of self print and she looked and our tickets said we would be fine... Again we were told wrong.
Larry of Mesa, AZ," Aug. 29, 2014","On September 4 my family of 5 arrived at the airport in Anchorage to fly home to Toronto via Dallas. Four of us had carry-on sized luggage but one had a mid-sized suitcase that we knew we would have to check. Our flight to Toronto included a 12.5-hour connection at DFW (not by choice). Since none of us sleep well on planes, we were considering going to a hotel following the overnight flight to DFW. When checking the suitcase, I specifically asked the American Airlines agent ""if we only check this bag to DFW and then go to a hotel for a few hours of sleep, will we be charged a second baggage fee to check the bag in for the flight to Toronto? If so we can rearrange the bags so that we can just check it through to Toronto."" "
Mike of Las Cruces, NM," Aug. 28, 2014","I purchased the basic economy ticket. When I was getting ready to board in Charlotte, the attendant mentioned that this was a new program for your airline and that customers have stated it was cost effective. However, this was not my case! I paid nearly $600 to fly from Columbus, OH to Asheville, NC. Absolutely absurd!!! In the future, I will do all I can to avoid flying with your airline and don't count on a positive recommendation from me to others! Also, stop charging for the first piece of checked in luggage!"

I called at night again because I was worried I saw it was still cancel. After almost 2 hours they answered the phone. I told them what happened. They told me that they were very sorry but the flight was canceled and they didnt' have flight for Sept 12. They gave me 1 stop flight for Sept 13. "
Teresa of Charlotte, NC," Aug. 27, 2014","I was scheduled to fly out of Tampa International on Sunday, September, 17th to Durango, CO. I live in Sarasota, and just returned home the other day after evacuating for Hurricane Irma. I fled Florida and headed to Georgia, where I had to rent a hotel for a few nights. When I returned home I was fortunate enough not to have suffered damage. I of course have yard debris strewn about and I am still without power. The power company has estimated by the end of the day on September 22nd I will have power. With the extra costs incurred from having to leave my home, and the loss of power, I decided this was not a good time to travel."
Julie of Troy, MI," Aug. 27, 2014","Hurricane Irma was mess for AA. I get it. I'm sure there were thousands who were stuck trying to get their flights changed. Unfortunately, I was in Costa Rica with a connection via Miami and I got, as the AA agent said ""the short end of the stick."" I would be stuck almost another week in Costa Rica as everything AA had was booked out or cancelled. I saw a little bit of silver lining when I found that if I could get to Mexico city, I could fly home via DFW. However, AA would not change the ticket as it is against their rules to change the country of origin on a ticket. ""We cannot do it."" However, a more accurate description is ""will not."""
Betsy of Graceville, FL," Aug. 25, 2014","We were delayed on our AA out of Seattle due to having to wait on flight crew. Managed to make it to Dallas on time BUT had to sit on the tarmac for 20 mins waiting for a gait in order to deplane. This caused to miss our connecting flight. Next available flight is the next day. Asked about compensation for overnight hotel stay (there are 7 in our party, including a 3 year old) and were denied due to the delay being coded as weather related, which is absolutely bogus. So livid, frustrated, and tired at this point. Also found out AA has no number to call for complaints... You have to go through email so who knows if they will even read it or reply. Will never fly AA again if I can help it."
Tracy of Lowell, MA," Aug. 24, 2014","I was on an almost 2 hour flight (Flight AA3936) stuck sitting with one leg over my bag and the other on the edge of the aisle. Not once was I asked to check in my bag nor told it wouldn't fit on the overhead bin. By the time we landed my knees, hips and back were killing me and I had to have help from the gentleman next to me to be able to stand up. So glad there wasn't an emergency 'cause this would have been one hell of a hazard. Lesson learned not to use this airline again."
Randy of Las Vegas, NV," Aug. 24, 2014","American Airlines‰Û_the new standard for horrible service. Oh‰Û_I mean HORRIBLE! I travel very frequently for work and have stuck to one specific airline in order to build my status with them (ie. first class upgrades often, better seat choices, free checked bags). Recently, service has taken a turn for the worse. I‰Ûªm a reasonable guy and tolerate more than most. Call it my Southern hospitality, my upbringing or my service to the community when I served in law enforcement, but I just plain put up with more‰Û_until now."
Karim of Lyndhurst, NJ," Aug. 23, 2014","I travel 80%~ for Work and have flown with almost every airline multiple times. AA is by far the worst. Not due to their customer service/staff/delays or anything like that (at least that I‰Ûªve noticed), but their planes have no entertainment system on each seat, they do not play movies on the overhead screens, and they don‰Ûªt even have a free WiFi movie/tv option you can connect to using your phone! I‰Ûªm currently on a flight from Boston to Phoenix and was utterly shocked when I sat in my seat and noticed no form of entertainment for a cross-country flight. Delta and other airlines provide personal entertainment screens on each screen or a smartphone connect feature for 2+ hr flights, which in turn make the flights more enjoyable. Anyways, to avoid rambling on and on about the lack of technology on AA planes I‰Ûªll just say if you enjoyed traveling in the late 90s early 2000s, then AA is for you. If you want to travel in 2017 and beyond, find a different airline."
Christine of Spokane, WA," Aug. 21, 2014","I had a horrible experience today on my flight back to Miami. I have been an AAdvantage member for many years now and have always chosen to be loyal to American but after today's experience that may change. The onboarding process was fine and the flight was on time, which to be honest is rare but I was happy. When the snacks and beverage cart came the attendant did not smile, looked unhappy to take our beverage order, handed me and my husband 2 cookies, I then I told her, ""Can we just get pretzels?"" She said ""Then I need the cookies back."" I was honestly appalled."
Jennie of Tucson, AZ," Aug. 20, 2014","Don't deserve single star. Also, I have a flight from Chicago to Minneapolis 5 hours from now. And they have seats available on the earlier flight but won't give you without charging $75. They are ok to make you wait or fly a flight with empty seats but no customer delight which is no cost to them. No customer driven company and not looking for going extra mile to make customer happy. Never travel on American Airlines again."

We do not live near the airport so we were up early to make sure we were early and nothing could go wrong. But things did go wrong. When we got to the airport we went and printed out tickets at the self checkout. We did notice that it mentioned no overhead storage for our carry on bags. So confused because we fly a lot and there is always overhead storage or they place in under the cabin. So we asked a lady that was standing in the area of self print and she looked and our tickets said we would be fine... Again we were told wrong.
Kevin of Morgan Hill, CA," July 30, 2014","On September 4 my family of 5 arrived at the airport in Anchorage to fly home to Toronto via Dallas. Four of us had carry-on sized luggage but one had a mid-sized suitcase that we knew we would have to check. Our flight to Toronto included a 12.5-hour connection at DFW (not by choice). Since none of us sleep well on planes, we were considering going to a hotel following the overnight flight to DFW. When checking the suitcase, I specifically asked the American Airlines agent ""if we only check this bag to DFW and then go to a hotel for a few hours of sleep, will we be charged a second baggage fee to check the bag in for the flight to Toronto? If so we can rearrange the bags so that we can just check it through to Toronto."" "
Don of New York, NY," July 28, 2014","I purchased the basic economy ticket. When I was getting ready to board in Charlotte, the attendant mentioned that this was a new program for your airline and that customers have stated it was cost effective. However, this was not my case! I paid nearly $600 to fly from Columbus, OH to Asheville, NC. Absolutely absurd!!! In the future, I will do all I can to avoid flying with your airline and don't count on a positive recommendation from me to others! Also, stop charging for the first piece of checked in luggage!"

I called at night again because I was worried I saw it was still cancel. After almost 2 hours they answered the phone. I told them what happened. They told me that they were very sorry but the flight was canceled and they didnt' have flight for Sept 12. They gave me 1 stop flight for Sept 13. "
Prasun of Tempe, AZ," July 21, 2014","I was scheduled to fly out of Tampa International on Sunday, September, 17th to Durango, CO. I live in Sarasota, and just returned home the other day after evacuating for Hurricane Irma. I fled Florida and headed to Georgia, where I had to rent a hotel for a few nights. When I returned home I was fortunate enough not to have suffered damage. I of course have yard debris strewn about and I am still without power. The power company has estimated by the end of the day on September 22nd I will have power. With the extra costs incurred from having to leave my home, and the loss of power, I decided this was not a good time to travel."
Rahul of Phoenix, AZ," July 18, 2014","Hurricane Irma was mess for AA. I get it. I'm sure there were thousands who were stuck trying to get their flights changed. Unfortunately, I was in Costa Rica with a connection via Miami and I got, as the AA agent said ""the short end of the stick."" I would be stuck almost another week in Costa Rica as everything AA had was booked out or cancelled. I saw a little bit of silver lining when I found that if I could get to Mexico city, I could fly home via DFW. However, AA would not change the ticket as it is against their rules to change the country of origin on a ticket. ""We cannot do it."" However, a more accurate description is ""will not."""
Marlene of Kokomo, IN," July 18, 2014","We were delayed on our AA out of Seattle due to having to wait on flight crew. Managed to make it to Dallas on time BUT had to sit on the tarmac for 20 mins waiting for a gait in order to deplane. This caused to miss our connecting flight. Next available flight is the next day. Asked about compensation for overnight hotel stay (there are 7 in our party, including a 3 year old) and were denied due to the delay being coded as weather related, which is absolutely bogus. So livid, frustrated, and tired at this point. Also found out AA has no number to call for complaints... You have to go through email so who knows if they will even read it or reply. Will never fly AA again if I can help it."
Elana of Marina Del Rey , CA," July 17, 2014","I was on an almost 2 hour flight (Flight AA3936) stuck sitting with one leg over my bag and the other on the edge of the aisle. Not once was I asked to check in my bag nor told it wouldn't fit on the overhead bin. By the time we landed my knees, hips and back were killing me and I had to have help from the gentleman next to me to be able to stand up. So glad there wasn't an emergency 'cause this would have been one hell of a hazard. Lesson learned not to use this airline again."
Chet of Jacksonville , FL," July 16, 2014","American Airlines‰Û_the new standard for horrible service. Oh‰Û_I mean HORRIBLE! I travel very frequently for work and have stuck to one specific airline in order to build my status with them (ie. first class upgrades often, better seat choices, free checked bags). Recently, service has taken a turn for the worse. I‰Ûªm a reasonable guy and tolerate more than most. Call it my Southern hospitality, my upbringing or my service to the community when I served in law enforcement, but I just plain put up with more‰Û_until now."
Natasha of Rowlett, TX," July 13, 2014","I travel 80%~ for Work and have flown with almost every airline multiple times. AA is by far the worst. Not due to their customer service/staff/delays or anything like that (at least that I‰Ûªve noticed), but their planes have no entertainment system on each seat, they do not play movies on the overhead screens, and they don‰Ûªt even have a free WiFi movie/tv option you can connect to using your phone! I‰Ûªm currently on a flight from Boston to Phoenix and was utterly shocked when I sat in my seat and noticed no form of entertainment for a cross-country flight. Delta and other airlines provide personal entertainment screens on each screen or a smartphone connect feature for 2+ hr flights, which in turn make the flights more enjoyable. Anyways, to avoid rambling on and on about the lack of technology on AA planes I‰Ûªll just say if you enjoyed traveling in the late 90s early 2000s, then AA is for you. If you want to travel in 2017 and beyond, find a different airline."
Sushil of Carbondale, IL," July 13, 2014","I had a horrible experience today on my flight back to Miami. I have been an AAdvantage member for many years now and have always chosen to be loyal to American but after today's experience that may change. The onboarding process was fine and the flight was on time, which to be honest is rare but I was happy. When the snacks and beverage cart came the attendant did not smile, looked unhappy to take our beverage order, handed me and my husband 2 cookies, I then I told her, ""Can we just get pretzels?"" She said ""Then I need the cookies back."" I was honestly appalled."
Tona of Willow Grove, PA," July 11, 2014","Don't deserve single star. Also, I have a flight from Chicago to Minneapolis 5 hours from now. And they have seats available on the earlier flight but won't give you without charging $75. They are ok to make you wait or fly a flight with empty seats but no customer delight which is no cost to them. No customer driven company and not looking for going extra mile to make customer happy. Never travel on American Airlines again."
Sara of San Francisco, CA," July 10, 2014","Worst experience ever with AA never again, they treated my dad like garbage, they humiliated my dad in front of my niece travelling with him and in front of all passengers, just because my dad is ** and not fluent in English. I wish I could sue them for discrimination against my dad for not speaking English fluent instead of offering assistance in Spanish which, the sky harbor airport in Arizona has plenty of bilingual employees. DO NOT FLY AA EVER, pay more with a different airline. The only reason why my dad and niece flew AA to go to my brother's funeral, thank you AA for the worst day ever. It's a shame I have to put a star instead of no stars service."
Travis of Chandler, AZ," July 8, 2014","This American Airlines review is out of frustration due to a lot of things. They're a disgrace! The employees are rude, there is no leg room, no entertainment, and treat people like herds of sheep. They have a ""New"" rule where they charge $50 at the gate to carry on your luggage. Are you kidding me? $50 for a carry on? And I can't even use the overhead bin! Disgraceful! Basically these guys are crooks! They're a disgrace. Last time I flew with American their flight was delayed by 2 hours and we ended up missing our connecting flight because it was the last flight out. We ended up having to stay an extra day and had to pay $100 for a hotel. We missed my sisters wedding. On the way back we ended up stuck on the tarmac for 2 hours. Of course!"
JC of Tampa, FL," July 7, 2014","I booked a ticket back when the hurricane were hitting down south every other week. Because of that I was not able to attend my trip in GA. They told me I had up to a year to use my ticket. So when I try to rebook my ticket they are now close to $500. Mind you this is the highest rate out of all the airlines for my particular dates, I asked for a refund because I didn't wanna double what I paid the first time and I was told by the Supervisor (Willie ** in Dallas ) that my only option was to ""use it or lost it"". Being a supervisor myself I thought the tone in which he said it was very careless and he didn't try to help the situation at all. I would never talk to my customers the way he spoke to me especially after losing out on $300!!"
Charles  of Glen Allen, VA," July 5, 2014","I just completed a flight on American Airlines. I had read negative reviews, but I found the American Airlines people I had contact with were great, tried to provide all the service they could because our flight had been cancelled due WX and had to layover at ORD. My complaint is the phoney coupon given for a hotel room for a ""discounted rate"". The coupon has nothing to do with American Airlines, but is only a hotel booking service. When I called the phone number provided I was told the only available room was 10 miles away and given a rate of $80.00. It was getting late in the evening so took it. Then was advised there was a $15 service charge to book the room. American Airline paid none of this. The shuttle bus to the hotel was packed (Other delayed passengers). When I got home I checked the hotel rate and found the same room went for $105. I ""saved"" $10. The hotel was a Holiday Inn Express. Room not bad."

She made up some baloney about Homeland Security not letting people fly with spots on their passport. I told her I checked their website and there was no mention of anything like that. She then claimed, ""Oh, they don't tell you."" I said, ""Then how are you supposed to know?""

While I was away, I heard the news that my dad had passed away. In which, I contacted American Airlines right away and asked if anything can be done. I wanted to fly back before my actual trip date, due to obvious reasons. I even offered to provide them with a death certificate if need be (although, I don't think that is even something they should ask for right away). I spoke to 3 different customer service reps who were all horrible to speak with. They had zero compassion and empathy and just dismissed me as if what I was experiencing was far from a big deal to them. "
Luis of Newberry, SC," June 27, 2014","I was on the plane for 14 hours due to a delay. Sitting in a broken seat that would not recline. I told the stewardess and she could care less, said nothing she can do. After I got home I contacted the airline and they issued me a fourteen dollar credit. I had paid 197.34 dollars for preferred seats. The worst flight of my life, never again w/ this airline."
DAnna of Decatur, GA," June 25, 2014","Overall, (Un)American Airlines continues to disappoint. I really only ever fly with AA as a last resort, and I can't see any reason to recommend traveling with AA. I was prior active duty Army, and now I'm a reservist, and only American Airlines makes me feel like my service is less important now. United, Southwest, Jet Blue, Delta, every other airline doesn't discriminate between Active Duty and Reserve/Guardsmen when it comes to bag fees. So, along with uncomfortable, outdated planes and poor service, I spent a $100 checking bags to and from my destination."
Kimberly of Carolina Beach, NC," June 25, 2014",American Airlines is the worst airlines to fly anywhere. They cram you in the seats with no leg room or any room for that matter. I requested a wheelchair at airport and waited 30 minutes upon someone finally arriving. They took me the wrong way to my next check in and I missed my flight. They said I would have to rebook my ticket and just wait for the next flight. Attendant at the gate was very disrespectful and not helpful at all. I had no control over this situation at all. Not to mention when I did finally arrive at my destination that I requested a wheelchair prior to my departure.
Maryanne of Newport News, VA," June 24, 2014","American Airlines is the worst airline in THE WORLD, and should change their name, it is utterly disgraceful that as an American they use this name. Their policy is to not apologize for anything, to be as rude as possible to people who are basically held hostage to them and their BS policies like closing the door to the gate while people are standing there then charging them money to rebook their flight, not caring at all about the bags on their way to a destination without the owners there to pick them up. Then being told when lodging a complaint that it was going in one ear and out the other. I have never been treated so poorly in my life, I will never again fly with this airline, I hope they go bankrupt and get the worst karma life can give. Oh yeah and I get to fly with them tomorrow. :/"
Thauana of Malden, MA," June 24, 2014","Very disappointed. Unlikely I will ever choose American Airlines again. I didn't make my flight in the spring. I was given a voucher to use for future travel. Now I'm being told I can only use it myself, and not for my family. I don't want to use it for myself. What difference does it make? I'm being told different things by different people. The last guy hung up on me and I wasn't even rude to him. This is how AA does business? All I want is to not be penalized for cancelling a flight that was beyond my control. If you have a voucher it should be flexible to use for anyone. AA is the WORST! Hope they go out of business for this nonsense. Airline travel is a joke."
Heather of San Antonio, TX," June 23, 2014","American Airlines canceled my 92-year-old father-in-law's flight to Key West due to Hurricane Irma. On that day American Airline was contacted and the representative said there would be no problem re-booking, just use the reference number. American Airlines even went on TV and said they would waive re-booking fees. Today when calling to re-book the flight and after 57 minutes on the phone, I was told the flight could not be re-booked because it was in their notes I requested a refund. At no time did I request a refund and American Airlines could not locate any record of a refund request. Even so, American Airlines still insisted they could not re-book the flight or issue a refund. If we did not have enough trouble dealing with a Cat 4 hurricane and its devastating aftermath, now American Airlines is adding to the misery. All my father-in-law wants is to come to Key West and see that everyone is alright. Thanks, AA."
Mary of Gilbert, AZ," June 22, 2014",I bought tickets for my mother in law and son to meet my wife and I in Colorado. We had traveled on different airlines due to connections and therefore were going back on different airlines. My wife and I left on our airplane. My mother in law and son were stranded as the plane had a mechanical. This was 8 AM and the bottom line was it didn't get fixed that day. American gave them a 12.00 voucher good in the terminal and did nothing to get them a room as the rooms they usually used weren't available.
maureen of St Petersburg, FL," June 20, 2014","I booked 2 separate flights on American Airlines in Economy since I pay for my air travel. On one they pre-assigned me a back-of-plane middle seat and said that I was required to pay some increased fee for window, aisle or closer to the front. On the second flight they said I have to wait until I reach the boarding gate for any seat. This is ridiculous and unacceptable. The airline has sufficient revenue to - just a suggestion - increase the ""base"" fare to cover a first-come-first-served seat selection and not put everyone into 3rd class or worse status. If they want to surcharge certain premium seats, like middle seats toward the front, that's OK, but this behavior is totally unacceptable and I refuse to fly them (or any airline) that abuses their passengers."
Taimur of Riyadh, NH," June 18, 2014",Well I looked into changing my flight for my fiance and I to go home a day earlier... only to discover that American charges $200.00 a ticket PLUS the difference in price tickets!

I have already paid for a flight and now you are trying to rip me off even more!?! Out of touch and terrible service to a customer of over 5 years.

miosoty of Hartford, CT," May 10, 2014","Where do I even begin? I had a round trip flight booked from Toronto, Ontario to Busan, South Korea back in the month of July (2017). While I was away, I heard the news that my dad had passed away. In which, I contacted American Airlines right away and asked if anything can be done. I wanted to fly back before my actual trip date, due to obvious reasons. I even offered to provide them with a death certificate if need be (although, I don't think that is even something they should ask for right away). I spoke to 3 different customer service reps who were all horrible to speak with. They had zero compassion and empathy and just dismissed me as if what I was experiencing was far from a big deal to them. "
Tabitha of Vale, NC," May 8, 2014","I was on the plane for 14 hours due to a delay. Sitting in a broken seat that would not recline. I told the stewardess and she could care less, said nothing she can do. After I got home I contacted the airline and they issued me a fourteen dollar credit. I had paid 197.34 dollars for preferred seats. The worst flight of my life, never again w/ this airline."
Kristen of Denver, CO," May 7, 2014","Overall, (Un)American Airlines continues to disappoint. I really only ever fly with AA as a last resort, and I can't see any reason to recommend traveling with AA. I was prior active duty Army, and now I'm a reservist, and only American Airlines makes me feel like my service is less important now. United, Southwest, Jet Blue, Delta, every other airline doesn't discriminate between Active Duty and Reserve/Guardsmen when it comes to bag fees. So, along with uncomfortable, outdated planes and poor service, I spent a $100 checking bags to and from my destination."
rebecca of New Albany, IN," May 5, 2014",American Airlines is the worst airlines to fly anywhere. They cram you in the seats with no leg room or any room for that matter. I requested a wheelchair at airport and waited 30 minutes upon someone finally arriving. They took me the wrong way to my next check in and I missed my flight. They said I would have to rebook my ticket and just wait for the next flight. Attendant at the gate was very disrespectful and not helpful at all. I had no control over this situation at all. Not to mention when I did finally arrive at my destination that I requested a wheelchair prior to my departure.
Lisa of Beverly, MA," April 24, 2014","American Airlines is the worst airline in THE WORLD, and should change their name, it is utterly disgraceful that as an American they use this name. Their policy is to not apologize for anything, to be as rude as possible to people who are basically held hostage to them and their BS policies like closing the door to the gate while people are standing there then charging them money to rebook their flight, not caring at all about the bags on their way to a destination without the owners there to pick them up. Then being told when lodging a complaint that it was going in one ear and out the other. I have never been treated so poorly in my life, I will never again fly with this airline, I hope they go bankrupt and get the worst karma life can give. Oh yeah and I get to fly with them tomorrow. :/"
Gina of Wethersfield, CT," April 22, 2014","Very disappointed. Unlikely I will ever choose American Airlines again. I didn't make my flight in the spring. I was given a voucher to use for future travel. Now I'm being told I can only use it myself, and not for my family. I don't want to use it for myself. What difference does it make? I'm being told different things by different people. The last guy hung up on me and I wasn't even rude to him. This is how AA does business? All I want is to not be penalized for cancelling a flight that was beyond my control. If you have a voucher it should be flexible to use for anyone. AA is the WORST! Hope they go out of business for this nonsense. Airline travel is a joke."
Jodi-Ann of New Haven, CT," April 19, 2014","American Airlines canceled my 92-year-old father-in-law's flight to Key West due to Hurricane Irma. On that day American Airline was contacted and the representative said there would be no problem re-booking, just use the reference number. American Airlines even went on TV and said they would waive re-booking fees. Today when calling to re-book the flight and after 57 minutes on the phone, I was told the flight could not be re-booked because it was in their notes I requested a refund. At no time did I request a refund and American Airlines could not locate any record of a refund request. Even so, American Airlines still insisted they could not re-book the flight or issue a refund. If we did not have enough trouble dealing with a Cat 4 hurricane and its devastating aftermath, now American Airlines is adding to the misery. All my father-in-law wants is to come to Key West and see that everyone is alright. Thanks, AA."
Wanda of Vineland, NJ," April 18, 2014",I bought tickets for my mother in law and son to meet my wife and I in Colorado. We had traveled on different airlines due to connections and therefore were going back on different airlines. My wife and I left on our airplane. My mother in law and son were stranded as the plane had a mechanical. This was 8 AM and the bottom line was it didn't get fixed that day. American gave them a 12.00 voucher good in the terminal and did nothing to get them a room as the rooms they usually used weren't available.
Francisco of Glassboro, NJ," April 15, 2014","I booked 2 separate flights on American Airlines in Economy since I pay for my air travel. On one they pre-assigned me a back-of-plane middle seat and said that I was required to pay some increased fee for window, aisle or closer to the front. On the second flight they said I have to wait until I reach the boarding gate for any seat. This is ridiculous and unacceptable. The airline has sufficient revenue to - just a suggestion - increase the ""base"" fare to cover a first-come-first-served seat selection and not put everyone into 3rd class or worse status. If they want to surcharge certain premium seats, like middle seats toward the front, that's OK, but this behavior is totally unacceptable and I refuse to fly them (or any airline) that abuses their passengers."
Michelle of Miami, FL," April 14, 2014",Well I looked into changing my flight for my fiance and I to go home a day earlier... only to discover that American charges $200.00 a ticket PLUS the difference in price tickets! LIKE THAT IS GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE! So for the price of another ticket I can change my flight! I will be looking elsewhere for flights in the future. I have already paid for a flight and now you are trying to rip me off even more!?! Out of touch and terrible service to a customer of over 5 years. I will be going elsewhere where I don't get bent over the table. Thank you American!

I was informed by two customer service representatives that I would be able to rebook my flight to Miami with no additional charges in fare and no change fees. Of course, when it comes time to book my flight, I'm informed about a change fee. I told the agent, I was reassured twice that I would not be charged any additional fees because my initial cancellation was weather related. "
Daniel of Austin, TX," April 1, 2014","American Airlines is full of **. Our cruise was cancelled due to Hurricane Irma. It was beyond our control and the airline stated there was nothing that they could do. No partial credit, changes or anything! I will not be flying with them anymore!"
Thomas of Salisbury, CT," March 29, 2014",My husband and I were scheduled to fly out at 7:15 am to go to California for a very important family matter. We do not live near the airport so we were up early to make sure we were early and nothing could go wrong. But things did go wrong. When we got to the airport we went and printed out tickets at the self checkout. We did notice that it mentioned no overhead storage for our carry on bags. So confused because we fly a lot and there is always overhead storage or they place in under the cabin. So we asked a lady that was standing in the area of self print and she looked and our tickets said we would be fine... Again we were told wrong.
paula of Clyde River, NS," March 19, 2014","On September 4 my family of 5 arrived at the airport in Anchorage to fly home to Toronto via Dallas. Four of us had carry-on sized luggage but one had a mid-sized suitcase that we knew we would have to check. Our flight to Toronto included a 12.5-hour connection at DFW (not by choice). Since none of us sleep well on planes, we were considering going to a hotel following the overnight flight to DFW. When checking the suitcase, I specifically asked the American Airlines agent ""if we only check this bag to DFW and then go to a hotel for a few hours of sleep, will we be charged a second baggage fee to check the bag in for the flight to Toronto? If so we can rearrange the bags so that we can just check it through to Toronto."" "

jim of Redondo Beach, CA," Feb. 27, 2014","I was scheduled to fly out of Tampa International on Sunday, September, 17th to Durango, CO.

When I returned home I was fortunate enough not to have suffered damage. I of course have yard debris strewn about and I am still without power. The power company has estimated by the end of the day on September 22nd I will have power. With the extra costs incurred from having to leave my home, and the loss of power, I decided this was not a good time to travel."
T of Round Hill, VA," Feb. 25, 2014","Hurricane Irma was mess for AA. I get it. I'm sure there were thousands who were stuck trying to get their flights changed. Unfortunately, I was in Costa Rica with a connection via Miami and I got, as the AA agent said ""the short end of the stick."" I would be stuck almost another week in Costa Rica as everything AA had was booked out or cancelled. I saw a little bit of silver lining when I found that if I could get to Mexico city, I could fly home via DFW. However, AA would not change the ticket as it is against their rules to change the country of origin on a ticket. ""We cannot do it."" However, a more accurate description is ""will not."""
Maxim of West Hollywood, CA," Feb. 20, 2014","We were delayed on our AA out of Seattle due to having to wait on flight crew. Managed to make it to Dallas on time BUT had to sit on the tarmac for 20 mins waiting for a gait in order to deplane. This caused to miss our connecting flight. Next available flight is the next day. Asked about compensation for overnight hotel stay (there are 7 in our party, including a 3 year old) and were denied due to the delay being coded as weather related, which is absolutely bogus. So livid, frustrated, and tired at this point. Also found out AA has no number to call for complaints... You have to go through email so who knows if they will even read it or reply. Will never fly AA again if I can help it."
Chhi of San Diego, CA," Feb. 18, 2014","I was on an almost 2 hour flight (Flight AA3936) stuck sitting with one leg over my bag and the other on the edge of the aisle. Not once was I asked to check in my bag nor told it wouldn't fit on the overhead bin. By the time we landed my knees, hips and back were killing me and I had to have help from the gentleman next to me to be able to stand up. So glad there wasn't an emergency 'cause this would have been one hell of a hazard. Lesson learned not to use this airline again."
Deena of East Stroudsburg, PA," Feb. 16, 2014","American Airlines‰Û_the new standard for horrible service. Oh‰Û_I mean HORRIBLE! I travel very frequently for work and have stuck to one specific airline in order to build my status with them (ie. first class upgrades often, better seat choices, free checked bags). Recently, service has taken a turn for the worse. I‰Ûªm a reasonable guy and tolerate more than most. Call it my Southern hospitality, my upbringing or my service to the community when I served in law enforcement, but I just plain put up with more‰Û_until now."
David of Fly Creek, NY," Feb. 14, 2014","I travel 80%~ for Work and have flown with almost every airline multiple times. AA is by far the worst. Not due to their customer service/staff/delays or anything like that (at least that I‰Ûªve noticed), but their planes have no entertainment system on each seat, they do not play movies on the overhead screens, and they don‰Ûªt even have a free WiFi movie/tv option you can connect to using your phone! I‰Ûªm currently on a flight from Boston to Phoenix and was utterly shocked when I sat in my seat and noticed no form of entertainment for a cross-country flight. Delta and other airlines provide personal entertainment screens on each screen or a smartphone connect feature for 2+ hr flights, which in turn make the flights more enjoyable. Anyways, to avoid rambling on and on about the lack of technology on AA planes I‰Ûªll just say if you enjoyed traveling in the late 90s early 2000s, then AA is for you. If you want to travel in 2017 and beyond, find a different airline."
shery of Billings, MT," Feb. 13, 2014","I had a horrible experience today on my flight back to Miami. I have been an AAdvantage member for many years now and have always chosen to be loyal to American but after today's experience that may change. The onboarding process was fine and the flight was on time, which to be honest is rare but I was happy. When the snacks and beverage cart came the attendant did not smile, looked unhappy to take our beverage order, handed me and my husband 2 cookies, I then I told her, ""Can we just get pretzels?"" She said ""Then I need the cookies back."" I was honestly appalled."
Lincoln of Carlsbad, CA," Feb. 11, 2014","Don't deserve single star. Also, I have a flight from Chicago to Minneapolis 5 hours from now. And they have seats available on the earlier flight but won't give you without charging $75. They are ok to make you wait or fly a flight with empty seats but no customer delight which is no cost to them. No customer driven company and not looking for going extra mile to make customer happy. Never travel on American Airlines again."
Wendy of Haddonfield, NJ," Feb. 7, 2014","Worst experience ever with AA never again, they treated my dad like garbage, they humiliated my dad in front of my niece travelling with him and in front of all passengers, just because my dad is ** and not fluent in English. I wish I could sue them for discrimination against my dad for not speaking English fluent instead of offering assistance in Spanish which, the sky harbor airport in Arizona has plenty of bilingual employees. DO NOT FLY AA EVER, pay more with a different airline. The only reason why my dad and niece flew AA to go to my brother's funeral, thank you AA for the worst day ever. It's a shame I have to put a star instead of no stars service."
Jaqcqueline of Laurel, MD," Feb. 5, 2014","This American Airlines review is out of frustration due to a lot of things. They're a disgrace! The employees are rude, there is no leg room, no entertainment, and treat people like herds of sheep. They have a ""New"" rule where they charge $50 at the gate to carry on your luggage. Are you kidding me? $50 for a carry on? And I can't even use the overhead bin! Disgraceful! Basically these guys are crooks! They're a disgrace. Last time I flew with American their flight was delayed by 2 hours and we ended up missing our connecting flight because it was the last flight out. We ended up having to stay an extra day and had to pay $100 for a hotel. We missed my sisters wedding. On the way back we ended up stuck on the tarmac for 2 hours. Of course!"
Denden of Newport, RI," Jan. 31, 2014","I booked a ticket back when the hurricane were hitting down south every other week. Because of that I was not able to attend my trip in GA. They told me I had up to a year to use my ticket. So when I try to rebook my ticket they are now close to $500. Mind you this is the highest rate out of all the airlines for my particular dates, I asked for a refund because I didn't wanna double what I paid the first time and I was told by the Supervisor (Willie ** in Dallas ) that my only option was to ""use it or lost it"". Being a supervisor myself I thought the tone in which he said it was very careless and he didn't try to help the situation at all. I would never talk to my customers the way he spoke to me especially after losing out on $300!!"
allen of Sacramento, CA," Jan. 29, 2014","I just completed a flight on American Airlines. I had read negative reviews, but I found the American Airlines people I had contact with were great, tried to provide all the service they could because our flight had been cancelled due WX and had to layover at ORD. My complaint is the phoney coupon given for a hotel room for a ""discounted rate"". The coupon has nothing to do with American Airlines, but is only a hotel booking service. When I called the phone number provided I was told the only available room was 10 miles away and given a rate of $80.00. It was getting late in the evening so took it. Then was advised there was a $15 service charge to book the room. American Airline paid none of this. The shuttle bus to the hotel was packed (Other delayed passengers). When I got home I checked the hotel rate and found the same room went for $105. I ""saved"" $10. The hotel was a Holiday Inn Express. Room not bad."

Unfortunately, I was in Costa Rica with a connection via Miami and I got, as the AA agent said ""the short end of the stick."" I would be stuck almost another week in Costa Rica as everything AA had was booked out or cancelled. I saw a little bit of silver lining when I found that if I could get to Mexico city, I could fly home via DFW. However, AA would not change the ticket as it is against their rules to change the country of origin on a ticket. ""We cannot do it."" However, a more accurate description is ""will not."""
Rachel of Hatfield, PA," Nov. 4, 2013","We were delayed on our AA out of Seattle due to having to wait on flight crew. Managed to make it to Dallas on time BUT had to sit on the tarmac for 20 mins waiting for a gait in order to deplane. This caused to miss our connecting flight. Next available flight is the next day. Asked about compensation for overnight hotel stay (there are 7 in our party, including a 3 year old) and were denied due to the delay being coded as weather related, which is absolutely bogus. So livid, frustrated, and tired at this point. Also found out AA has no number to call for complaints... You have to go through email so who knows if they will even read it or reply. Will never fly AA again if I can help it."
Ali of Carbondale, CO," Oct. 29, 2013","I was on an almost 2 hour flight (Flight AA3936) stuck sitting with one leg over my bag and the other on the edge of the aisle. Not once was I asked to check in my bag nor told it wouldn't fit on the overhead bin. By the time we landed my knees, hips and back were killing me and I had to have help from the gentleman next to me to be able to stand up. So glad there wasn't an emergency 'cause this would have been one hell of a hazard. Lesson learned not to use this airline again."
Pat of Englewood, FL," Oct. 23, 2013","American Airlines‰Û_the new standard for horrible service. Oh‰Û_I mean HORRIBLE! I travel very frequently for work and have stuck to one specific airline in order to build my status with them (ie. first class upgrades often, better seat choices, free checked bags). Recently, service has taken a turn for the worse. I‰Ûªm a reasonable guy and tolerate more than most. Call it my Southern hospitality, my upbringing or my service to the community when I served in law enforcement, but I just plain put up with more‰Û_until now."
Pat of Englewood, FL," Oct. 23, 2013","I travel 80%~ for Work and have flown with almost every airline multiple times. AA is by far the worst. Not due to their customer service/staff/delays or anything like that (at least that I‰Ûªve noticed), but their planes have no entertainment system on each seat, they do not play movies on the overhead screens, and they don‰Ûªt even have a free WiFi movie/tv option you can connect to using your phone! I‰Ûªm currently on a flight from Boston to Phoenix and was utterly shocked when I sat in my seat and noticed no form of entertainment for a cross-country flight. Delta and other airlines provide personal entertainment screens on each screen or a smartphone connect feature for 2+ hr flights, which in turn make the flights more enjoyable. Anyways, to avoid rambling on and on about the lack of technology on AA planes I‰Ûªll just say if you enjoyed traveling in the late 90s early 2000s, then AA is for you. If you want to travel in 2017 and beyond, find a different airline."
Kim of Owensboro, KY," Oct. 18, 2013","I had a horrible experience today on my flight back to Miami. I have been an AAdvantage member for many years now and have always chosen to be loyal to American but after today's experience that may change. The onboarding process was fine and the flight was on time, which to be honest is rare but I was happy. When the snacks and beverage cart came the attendant did not smile, looked unhappy to take our beverage order, handed me and my husband 2 cookies, I then I told her, ""Can we just get pretzels?"" She said ""Then I need the cookies back."" I was honestly appalled."
Scott of Centreville, VA," Oct. 12, 2013","Don't deserve single star. Also, I have a flight from Chicago to Minneapolis 5 hours from now. And they have seats available on the earlier flight but won't give you without charging $75. They are ok to make you wait or fly a flight with empty seats but no customer delight which is no cost to them. No customer driven company and not looking for going extra mile to make customer happy. Never travel on American Airlines again."
Ronald of Tucson, AZ," Oct. 11, 2013","Worst experience ever with AA never again, they treated my dad like garbage, they humiliated my dad in front of my niece travelling with him and in front of all passengers, just because my dad is ** and not fluent in English. I wish I could sue them for discrimination against my dad for not speaking English fluent instead of offering assistance in Spanish which, the sky harbor airport in Arizona has plenty of bilingual employees. DO NOT FLY AA EVER, pay more with a different airline. The only reason why my dad and niece flew AA to go to my brother's funeral, thank you AA for the worst day ever. It's a shame I have to put a star instead of no stars service."
una of Ottawa, ON," Oct. 8, 2013","This American Airlines review is out of frustration due to a lot of things. They're a disgrace! The employees are rude, there is no leg room, no entertainment, and treat people like herds of sheep. They have a ""New"" rule where they charge $50 at the gate to carry on your luggage. Are you kidding me? $50 for a carry on? And I can't even use the overhead bin! Disgraceful! Basically these guys are crooks! They're a disgrace. Last time I flew with American their flight was delayed by 2 hours and we ended up missing our connecting flight because it was the last flight out. We ended up having to stay an extra day and had to pay $100 for a hotel. We missed my sisters wedding. On the way back we ended up stuck on the tarmac for 2 hours. Of course!"
Amber of Racine, WI," Oct. 7, 2013","I booked a ticket back when the hurricane were hitting down south every other week. Because of that I was not able to attend my trip in GA. They told me I had up to a year to use my ticket. So when I try to rebook my ticket they are now close to $500. Mind you this is the highest rate out of all the airlines for my particular dates, I asked for a refund because I didn't wanna double what I paid the first time and I was told by the Supervisor (Willie ** in Dallas ) that my only option was to ""use it or lost it"". Being a supervisor myself I thought the tone in which he said it was very careless and he didn't try to help the situation at all. I would never talk to my customers the way he spoke to me especially after losing out on $300!!"
Peter of Lakeland, FL," Oct. 7, 2013","I just completed a flight on American Airlines. I had read negative reviews, but I found the American Airlines people I had contact with were great, tried to provide all the service they could because our flight had been cancelled due WX and had to layover at ORD. My complaint is the phoney coupon given for a hotel room for a ""discounted rate"". The coupon has nothing to do with American Airlines, but is only a hotel booking service. When I called the phone number provided I was told the only available room was 10 miles away and given a rate of $80.00. It was getting late in the evening so took it. Then was advised there was a $15 service charge to book the room. American Airline paid none of this. The shuttle bus to the hotel was packed (Other delayed passengers). When I got home I checked the hotel rate and found the same room went for $105. I ""saved"" $10. The hotel was a Holiday Inn Express. Room not bad."

She made up some baloney about Homeland Security not letting people fly with spots on their passport. I told her I checked their website and there was no mention of anything like that. She then claimed, ""Oh, they don't tell you."" I said, ""Then how are you supposed to know?""

While I was away, I heard the news that my dad had passed away. In which, I contacted American Airlines right away and asked if anything can be done. I wanted to fly back before my actual trip date, due to obvious reasons. I even offered to provide them with a death certificate if need be (although, I don't think that is even something they should ask for right away). I spoke to 3 different customer service reps who were all horrible to speak with. They had zero compassion and empathy and just dismissed me as if what I was experiencing was far from a big deal to them. "
Reyna of Northridge, CA," Sept. 23, 2013","I was on the plane for 14 hours due to a delay. Sitting in a broken seat that would not recline. I told the stewardess and she could care less, said nothing she can do. After I got home I contacted the airline and they issued me a fourteen dollar credit. I had paid 197.34 dollars for preferred seats. The worst flight of my life, never again w/ this airline."
Ingunn of Unknown City, IL," Sept. 22, 2013","Overall, (Un)American Airlines continues to disappoint. I really only ever fly with AA as a last resort, and I can't see any reason to recommend traveling with AA. I was prior active duty Army, and now I'm a reservist, and only American Airlines makes me feel like my service is less important now. United, Southwest, Jet Blue, Delta, every other airline doesn't discriminate between Active Duty and Reserve/Guardsmen when it comes to bag fees. So, along with uncomfortable, outdated planes and poor service, I spent a $100 checking bags to and from my destination."
Mitchell of Garland, TX," Sept. 20, 2013",American Airlines is the worst airlines to fly anywhere. They cram you in the seats with no leg room or any room for that matter. I requested a wheelchair at airport and waited 30 minutes upon someone finally arriving. They took me the wrong way to my next check in and I missed my flight. They said I would have to rebook my ticket and just wait for the next flight. Attendant at the gate was very disrespectful and not helpful at all. I had no control over this situation at all. Not to mention when I did finally arrive at my destination that I requested a wheelchair prior to my departure.
Carl of Buckeye, AZ," Sept. 18, 2013","American Airlines is the worst airline in THE WORLD, and should change their name, it is utterly disgraceful that as an American they use this name. Their policy is to not apologize for anything, to be as rude as possible to people who are basically held hostage to them and their BS policies like closing the door to the gate while people are standing there then charging them money to rebook their flight, not caring at all about the bags on their way to a destination without the owners there to pick them up. Then being told when lodging a complaint that it was going in one ear and out the other. I have never been treated so poorly in my life, I will never again fly with this airline, I hope they go bankrupt and get the worst karma life can give. Oh yeah and I get to fly with them tomorrow. :/"
Juan of Oldsmar, FL," Sept. 18, 2013","Very disappointed. Unlikely I will ever choose American Airlines again. I didn't make my flight in the spring. I was given a voucher to use for future travel. Now I'm being told I can only use it myself, and not for my family. I don't want to use it for myself. What difference does it make? I'm being told different things by different people. The last guy hung up on me and I wasn't even rude to him. This is how AA does business? All I want is to not be penalized for cancelling a flight that was beyond my control. If you have a voucher it should be flexible to use for anyone. AA is the WORST! Hope they go out of business for this nonsense. Airline travel is a joke."
Victoria  of Westbury , NY," Sept. 17, 2013","American Airlines canceled my 92-year-old father-in-law's flight to Key West due to Hurricane Irma. On that day American Airline was contacted and the representative said there would be no problem re-booking, just use the reference number. American Airlines even went on TV and said they would waive re-booking fees. Today when calling to re-book the flight and after 57 minutes on the phone, I was told the flight could not be re-booked because it was in their notes I requested a refund. At no time did I request a refund and American Airlines could not locate any record of a refund request. Even so, American Airlines still insisted they could not re-book the flight or issue a refund. If we did not have enough trouble dealing with a Cat 4 hurricane and its devastating aftermath, now American Airlines is adding to the misery. All my father-in-law wants is to come to Key West and see that everyone is alright. Thanks, AA."
Cate of Washington, DC," Sept. 17, 2013",I bought tickets for my mother in law and son to meet my wife and I in Colorado. We had traveled on different airlines due to connections and therefore were going back on different airlines. My wife and I left on our airplane. My mother in law and son were stranded as the plane had a mechanical. This was 8 AM and the bottom line was it didn't get fixed that day. American gave them a 12.00 voucher good in the terminal and did nothing to get them a room as the rooms they usually used weren't available.
Melanie of Charlotte , NC," Sept. 13, 2013","I booked 2 separate flights on American Airlines in Economy since I pay for my air travel. On one they pre-assigned me a back-of-plane middle seat and said that I was required to pay some increased fee for window, aisle or closer to the front. On the second flight they said I have to wait until I reach the boarding gate for any seat. This is ridiculous and unacceptable. The airline has sufficient revenue to - just a suggestion - increase the ""base"" fare to cover a first-come-first-served seat selection and not put everyone into 3rd class or worse status. If they want to surcharge certain premium seats, like middle seats toward the front, that's OK, but this behavior is totally unacceptable and I refuse to fly them (or any airline) that abuses their passengers."
Niaya of Brooklyn, NY," Sept. 12, 2013",Well I looked into changing my flight for my fiance and I to go home a day earlier... only to discover that American charges $200.00 a ticket PLUS the difference in price tickets! LIKE THAT IS GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE! So for the price of another ticket I can change my flight! I will be looking elsewhere for flights in the future. I have already paid for a flight and now you are trying to rip me off even more!?! Out of touch and terrible service to a customer of over 5 years. I will be going elsewhere where I don't get bent over the table. Thank you American!
Susan of Wilmington, DE," Sept. 12, 2013","I originally booked my flight to Miami from Washington, DC back in July 2017. I was scheduled to fly September 13-18, 2017. I, like many, had to cancel my trip because of hurricane Irma. I was informed by two customer service representatives that I would be able to rebook my flight to Miami with no additional charges in fare and no change fees. Of course, when it comes time to book my flight, I'm informed about a change fee. I told the agent, I was reassured twice that I would not be charged any additional fees because my initial cancellation was weather related. "
Peter of New Rochelle, NY," Sept. 3, 2013","American Airlines is full of **. Our cruise was cancelled due to Hurricane Irma. It was beyond our control and the airline stated there was nothing that they could do. No partial credit, changes or anything! I will not be flying with them anymore!"
L of Landenberg, PA," Aug. 29, 2013",My husband and I were scheduled to fly out at 7:15 am to go to California for a very important family matter. We do not live near the airport so we were up early to make sure we were early and nothing could go wrong. But things did go wrong. When we got to the airport we went and printed out tickets at the self checkout. We did notice that it mentioned no overhead storage for our carry on bags. So confused because we fly a lot and there is always overhead storage or they place in under the cabin. So we asked a lady that was standing in the area of self print and she looked and our tickets said we would be fine... Again we were told wrong.
Mary Ellen  of Manassas, VA," Aug. 28, 2013","On September 4 my family of 5 arrived at the airport in Anchorage to fly home to Toronto via Dallas. Four of us had carry-on sized luggage but one had a mid-sized suitcase that we knew we would have to check. Our flight to Toronto included a 12.5-hour connection at DFW (not by choice). Since none of us sleep well on planes, we were considering going to a hotel following the overnight flight to DFW. When checking the suitcase, I specifically asked the American Airlines agent ""if we only check this bag to DFW and then go to a hotel for a few hours of sleep, will we be charged a second baggage fee to check the bag in for the flight to Toronto? If so we can rearrange the bags so that we can just check it through to Toronto."" "

However, this was not my case! I paid nearly $600 to fly from Columbus, OH to Asheville, NC. Absolutely absurd!!! In the future, I will do all I can to avoid flying with your airline and don't count on a positive recommendation from me to others! Also, stop charging for the first piece of checked in luggage!"

I called at night again because I was worried I saw it was still cancel. After almost 2 hours they answered the phone. I told them what happened. They told me that they were very sorry but the flight was canceled and they didnt' have flight for Sept 12. They gave me 1 stop flight for Sept 13. "

Then being told when lodging a complaint that it was going in one ear and out the other. I have never been treated so poorly in my life, I will never again fly with this airline, I hope they go bankrupt and get the worst karma life can give. Oh yeah and I get to fly with them tomorrow. :/"
Fly of Gloucester, MA," June 16, 2013","Very disappointed. Unlikely I will ever choose American Airlines again. I didn't make my flight in the spring. I was given a voucher to use for future travel. Now I'm being told I can only use it myself, and not for my family. I don't want to use it for myself. What difference does it make? I'm being told different things by different people. The last guy hung up on me and I wasn't even rude to him. This is how AA does business? All I want is to not be penalized for cancelling a flight that was beyond my control. If you have a voucher it should be flexible to use for anyone. AA is the WORST! Hope they go out of business for this nonsense. Airline travel is a joke."
Karla of Los Angeles, CA," June 13, 2013","American Airlines canceled my 92-year-old father-in-law's flight to Key West due to Hurricane Irma. On that day American Airline was contacted and the representative said there would be no problem re-booking, just use the reference number. American Airlines even went on TV and said they would waive re-booking fees. Today when calling to re-book the flight and after 57 minutes on the phone, I was told the flight could not be re-booked because it was in their notes I requested a refund. At no time did I request a refund and American Airlines could not locate any record of a refund request. Even so, American Airlines still insisted they could not re-book the flight or issue a refund. If we did not have enough trouble dealing with a Cat 4 hurricane and its devastating aftermath, now American Airlines is adding to the misery. All my father-in-law wants is to come to Key West and see that everyone is alright. Thanks, AA."
Joshua of Bozeman, MT," June 11, 2013",I bought tickets for my mother in law and son to meet my wife and I in Colorado. We had traveled on different airlines due to connections and therefore were going back on different airlines. My wife and I left on our airplane. My mother in law and son were stranded as the plane had a mechanical. This was 8 AM and the bottom line was it didn't get fixed that day. American gave them a 12.00 voucher good in the terminal and did nothing to get them a room as the rooms they usually used weren't available.
Akash of Fayetteville, NC," June 5, 2013","I booked 2 separate flights on American Airlines in Economy since I pay for my air travel. On one they pre-assigned me a back-of-plane middle seat and said that I was required to pay some increased fee for window, aisle or closer to the front. On the second flight they said I have to wait until I reach the boarding gate for any seat. This is ridiculous and unacceptable. The airline has sufficient revenue to - just a suggestion - increase the ""base"" fare to cover a first-come-first-served seat selection and not put everyone into 3rd class or worse status. If they want to surcharge certain premium seats, like middle seats toward the front, that's OK, but this behavior is totally unacceptable and I refuse to fly them (or any airline) that abuses their passengers."
Diana of Shawnee, KS," June 5, 2013",Well I looked into changing my flight for my fiance and I to go home a day earlier... only to discover that American charges $200.00 a ticket PLUS the difference in price tickets! LIKE THAT IS GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE! So for the price of another ticket I can change my flight! I will be looking elsewhere for flights in the future. I have already paid for a flight and now you are trying to rip me off even more!?! Out of touch and terrible service to a customer of over 5 years. I will be going elsewhere where I don't get bent over the table. Thank you American!
Jay of Swansea, IL," June 1, 2013","I originally booked my flight to Miami from Washington, DC back in July 2017. I was scheduled to fly September 13-18, 2017. I, like many, had to cancel my trip because of hurricane Irma. I was informed by two customer service representatives that I would be able to rebook my flight to Miami with no additional charges in fare and no change fees. Of course, when it comes time to book my flight, I'm informed about a change fee. I told the agent, I was reassured twice that I would not be charged any additional fees because my initial cancellation was weather related. "
Scott of Camden, AL," May 24, 2013","American Airlines is full of **. Our cruise was cancelled due to Hurricane Irma. It was beyond our control and the airline stated there was nothing that they could do. No partial credit, changes or anything! I will not be flying with them anymore!"
Joe of Rolla, MO," May 23, 2013",My husband and I were scheduled to fly out at 7:15 am to go to California for a very important family matter. We do not live near the airport so we were up early to make sure we were early and nothing could go wrong. But things did go wrong. When we got to the airport we went and printed out tickets at the self checkout. We did notice that it mentioned no overhead storage for our carry on bags. So confused because we fly a lot and there is always overhead storage or they place in under the cabin. So we asked a lady that was standing in the area of self print and she looked and our tickets said we would be fine... Again we were told wrong.
Briana of Copperas Cove , TX," May 22, 2013","On September 4 my family of 5 arrived at the airport in Anchorage to fly home to Toronto via Dallas. Four of us had carry-on sized luggage but one had a mid-sized suitcase that we knew we would have to check. Our flight to Toronto included a 12.5-hour connection at DFW (not by choice). Since none of us sleep well on planes, we were considering going to a hotel following the overnight flight to DFW. When checking the suitcase, I specifically asked the American Airlines agent ""if we only check this bag to DFW and then go to a hotel for a few hours of sleep, will we be charged a second baggage fee to check the bag in for the flight to Toronto? If so we can rearrange the bags so that we can just check it through to Toronto."" "
Russell of Lugoff, SC," May 21, 2013","I purchased the basic economy ticket. When I was getting ready to board in Charlotte, the attendant mentioned that this was a new program for your airline and that customers have stated it was cost effective. However, this was not my case! I paid nearly $600 to fly from Columbus, OH to Asheville, NC. Absolutely absurd!!! In the future, I will do all I can to avoid flying with your airline and don't count on a positive recommendation from me to others! Also, stop charging for the first piece of checked in luggage!"

I called at night again because I was worried I saw it was still cancel. After almost 2 hours they answered the phone. I told them what happened. They told me that they were very sorry but the flight was canceled and they didnt' have flight for Sept 12. They gave me 1 stop flight for Sept 13. "
Andy of Raleigh, NC," May 12, 2013","I was scheduled to fly out of Tampa International on Sunday, September, 17th to Durango, CO. I live in Sarasota, and just returned home the other day after evacuating for Hurricane Irma. I fled Florida and headed to Georgia, where I had to rent a hotel for a few nights. When I returned home I was fortunate enough not to have suffered damage. I of course have yard debris strewn about and I am still without power. The power company has estimated by the end of the day on September 22nd I will have power. With the extra costs incurred from having to leave my home, and the loss of power, I decided this was not a good time to travel."
John of Medley, FL," May 9, 2013","Hurricane Irma was mess for AA. I get it. I'm sure there were thousands who were stuck trying to get their flights changed. Unfortunately, I was in Costa Rica with a connection via Miami and I got, as the AA agent said ""the short end of the stick."" I would be stuck almost another week in Costa Rica as everything AA had was booked out or cancelled. I saw a little bit of silver lining when I found that if I could get to Mexico city, I could fly home via DFW. However, AA would not change the ticket as it is against their rules to change the country of origin on a ticket. ""We cannot do it."" However, a more accurate description is ""will not."""
Ian of North Vancouver, BC," April 27, 2013","We were delayed on our AA out of Seattle due to having to wait on flight crew. Managed to make it to Dallas on time BUT had to sit on the tarmac for 20 mins waiting for a gait in order to deplane. This caused to miss our connecting flight. Next available flight is the next day. Asked about compensation for overnight hotel stay (there are 7 in our party, including a 3 year old) and were denied due to the delay being coded as weather related, which is absolutely bogus. So livid, frustrated, and tired at this point. Also found out AA has no number to call for complaints... You have to go through email so who knows if they will even read it or reply. Will never fly AA again if I can help it."
Steve of Omaha, NE," April 27, 2013","I was on an almost 2 hour flight (Flight AA3936) stuck sitting with one leg over my bag and the other on the edge of the aisle. Not once was I asked to check in my bag nor told it wouldn't fit on the overhead bin. By the time we landed my knees, hips and back were killing me and I had to have help from the gentleman next to me to be able to stand up. So glad there wasn't an emergency 'cause this would have been one hell of a hazard. Lesson learned not to use this airline again."
Ying of Irvine, CA," April 26, 2013","American Airlines‰Û_the new standard for horrible service. Oh‰Û_I mean HORRIBLE! I travel very frequently for work and have stuck to one specific airline in order to build my status with them (ie. first class upgrades often, better seat choices, free checked bags). Recently, service has taken a turn for the worse. I‰Ûªm a reasonable guy and tolerate more than most. Call it my Southern hospitality, my upbringing or my service to the community when I served in law enforcement, but I just plain put up with more‰Û_until now."
Hilary of Columbia, MD," April 24, 2013","I travel 80%~ for Work and have flown with almost every airline multiple times. AA is by far the worst. Not due to their customer service/staff/delays or anything like that (at least that I‰Ûªve noticed), but their planes have no entertainment system on each seat, they do not play movies on the overhead screens, and they don‰Ûªt even have a free WiFi movie/tv option you can connect to using your phone! I‰Ûªm currently on a flight from Boston to Phoenix and was utterly shocked when I sat in my seat and noticed no form of entertainment for a cross-country flight. Delta and other airlines provide personal entertainment screens on each screen or a smartphone connect feature for 2+ hr flights, which in turn make the flights more enjoyable. Anyways, to avoid rambling on and on about the lack of technology on AA planes I‰Ûªll just say if you enjoyed traveling in the late 90s early 2000s, then AA is for you. If you want to travel in 2017 and beyond, find a different airline."
Brandon of Mesa, AZ," April 17, 2013","I had a horrible experience today on my flight back to Miami. I have been an AAdvantage member for many years now and have always chosen to be loyal to American but after today's experience that may change. The onboarding process was fine and the flight was on time, which to be honest is rare but I was happy. When the snacks and beverage cart came the attendant did not smile, looked unhappy to take our beverage order, handed me and my husband 2 cookies, I then I told her, ""Can we just get pretzels?"" She said ""Then I need the cookies back."" I was honestly appalled."
pablo of Menifee, CA," April 11, 2013","Don't deserve single star. Also, I have a flight from Chicago to Minneapolis 5 hours from now. And they have seats available on the earlier flight but won't give you without charging $75. They are ok to make you wait or fly a flight with empty seats but no customer delight which is no cost to them. No customer driven company and not looking for going extra mile to make customer happy. Never travel on American Airlines again."
Ken of Joliet, IL," April 10, 2013","Worst experience ever with AA never again, they treated my dad like garbage, they humiliated my dad in front of my niece travelling with him and in front of all passengers, just because my dad is ** and not fluent in English. I wish I could sue them for discrimination against my dad for not speaking English fluent instead of offering assistance in Spanish which, the sky harbor airport in Arizona has plenty of bilingual employees. DO NOT FLY AA EVER, pay more with a different airline. The only reason why my dad and niece flew AA to go to my brother's funeral, thank you AA for the worst day ever. It's a shame I have to put a star instead of no stars service."
Sophia of Indiana, IN," April 8, 2013","This American Airlines review is out of frustration due to a lot of things. They're a disgrace! The employees are rude, there is no leg room, no entertainment, and treat people like herds of sheep. They have a ""New"" rule where they charge $50 at the gate to carry on your luggage. Are you kidding me? $50 for a carry on? And I can't even use the overhead bin! Disgraceful! Basically these guys are crooks! They're a disgrace. Last time I flew with American their flight was delayed by 2 hours and we ended up missing our connecting flight because it was the last flight out. We ended up having to stay an extra day and had to pay $100 for a hotel. We missed my sisters wedding. On the way back we ended up stuck on the tarmac for 2 hours. Of course!"
Michael of Jasper, AL," April 7, 2013","I booked a ticket back when the hurricane were hitting down south every other week. Because of that I was not able to attend my trip in GA. They told me I had up to a year to use my ticket. So when I try to rebook my ticket they are now close to $500. Mind you this is the highest rate out of all the airlines for my particular dates, I asked for a refund because I didn't wanna double what I paid the first time and I was told by the Supervisor (Willie ** in Dallas ) that my only option was to ""use it or lost it"". Being a supervisor myself I thought the tone in which he said it was very careless and he didn't try to help the situation at all. I would never talk to my customers the way he spoke to me especially after losing out on $300!!"
John of Bryantsville, KY," April 4, 2013","I just completed a flight on American Airlines. I had read negative reviews, but I found the American Airlines people I had contact with were great, tried to provide all the service they could because our flight had been cancelled due WX and had to layover at ORD. My complaint is the phoney coupon given for a hotel room for a ""discounted rate"". The coupon has nothing to do with American Airlines, but is only a hotel booking service. When I called the phone number provided I was told the only available room was 10 miles away and given a rate of $80.00. It was getting late in the evening so took it. Then was advised there was a $15 service charge to book the room. American Airline paid none of this. The shuttle bus to the hotel was packed (Other delayed passengers). When I got home I checked the hotel rate and found the same room went for $105. I ""saved"" $10. The hotel was a Holiday Inn Express. Room not bad."
Susan of Duluth, GA," March 28, 2013","I was en route from San Antonio Texas to Hong Kong and when checking in for the domestic portion of the flight at the ticket counter, the woman claimed there was a problem with my passport. I asked for details and she claimed ""There are spots on your passport."" I told her the passport was still valid and did not expire until the following year."" She made up some baloney about Homeland Security not letting people fly with spots on their passport. I told her I checked their website and there was no mention of anything like that. She then claimed, ""Oh, they don't tell you."" I said, ""Then how are you supposed to know?"" She then sarcastically claimed I needed glasses, so I put my glasses on and told her those so called spots are not a problem. "

Scott of Roan Mountain, TN," March 22, 2013","Where do I even begin? I had a round trip flight booked from Toronto, Ontario to Busan, South Korea back in the month of July (2017). While I was away, I heard the news that my dad had passed away. In which, I contacted American Airlines right away and asked if anything can be done. I wanted to fly back before my actual trip date, due to obvious reasons. I even offered to provide them with a death certificate if need be (although, I don't think that is even something they should ask for right away). I spoke to 3 different customer service reps who were all horrible to speak with. They had zero compassion and empathy and just dismissed me as if what I was experiencing was far from a big deal to them. "
Olga of Tampa, FL," Feb. 28, 2013","I was on the plane for 14 hours due to a delay. Sitting in a broken seat that would not recline. I told the stewardess and she could care less, said nothing she can do. After I got home I contacted the airline and they issued me a fourteen dollar credit. I had paid 197.34 dollars for preferred seats. The worst flight of my life, never again w/ this airline."
Thom of Painted Post, NY," Feb. 27, 2013","Overall, (Un)American Airlines continues to disappoint. I really only ever fly with AA as a last resort, and I can't see any reason to recommend traveling with AA. I was prior active duty Army, and now I'm a reservist, and only American Airlines makes me feel like my service is less important now. United, Southwest, Jet Blue, Delta, every other airline doesn't discriminate between Active Duty and Reserve/Guardsmen when it comes to bag fees. So, along with uncomfortable, outdated planes and poor service, I spent a $100 checking bags to and from my destination."
Bob of Las Vegas, NV," Feb. 25, 2013",American Airlines is the worst airlines to fly anywhere. They cram you in the seats with no leg room or any room for that matter. I requested a wheelchair at airport and waited 30 minutes upon someone finally arriving. They took me the wrong way to my next check in and I missed my flight. They said I would have to rebook my ticket and just wait for the next flight. Attendant at the gate was very disrespectful and not helpful at all. I had no control over this situation at all. Not to mention when I did finally arrive at my destination that I requested a wheelchair prior to my departure.

If you want to travel in 2017 and beyond, find a different airline."
Paulo of Rio De Janeiro, OTHER," Dec. 10, 2012","I had a horrible experience today on my flight back to Miami. I have been an AAdvantage member for many years now and have always chosen to be loyal to American but after today's experience that may change. The onboarding process was fine and the flight was on time, which to be honest is rare but I was happy. When the snacks and beverage cart came the attendant did not smile, looked unhappy to take our beverage order, handed me and my husband 2 cookies, I then I told her, ""Can we just get pretzels?"" She said ""Then I need the cookies back."" I was honestly appalled."
Richard of Oakland, CA," Nov. 11, 2012","Don't deserve single star. Also, I have a flight from Chicago to Minneapolis 5 hours from now. And they have seats available on the earlier flight but won't give you without charging $75. They are ok to make you wait or fly a flight with empty seats but no customer delight which is no cost to them. No customer driven company and not looking for going extra mile to make customer happy. Never travel on American Airlines again."
Avani of New York, NY," Nov. 1, 2012","Worst experience ever with AA never again, they treated my dad like garbage, they humiliated my dad in front of my niece travelling with him and in front of all passengers, just because my dad is ** and not fluent in English. I wish I could sue them for discrimination against my dad for not speaking English fluent instead of offering assistance in Spanish which, the sky harbor airport in Arizona has plenty of bilingual employees. DO NOT FLY AA EVER, pay more with a different airline. The only reason why my dad and niece flew AA to go to my brother's funeral, thank you AA for the worst day ever. It's a shame I have to put a star instead of no stars service."
Robert of Chandler, AZ," Oct. 29, 2012","This American Airlines review is out of frustration due to a lot of things. They're a disgrace! The employees are rude, there is no leg room, no entertainment, and treat people like herds of sheep. They have a ""New"" rule where they charge $50 at the gate to carry on your luggage. Are you kidding me? $50 for a carry on? And I can't even use the overhead bin! Disgraceful! Basically these guys are crooks! They're a disgrace. Last time I flew with American their flight was delayed by 2 hours and we ended up missing our connecting flight because it was the last flight out. We ended up having to stay an extra day and had to pay $100 for a hotel. We missed my sisters wedding. On the way back we ended up stuck on the tarmac for 2 hours. Of course!"
Paula of Littleton, CO," Oct. 26, 2012","I booked a ticket back when the hurricane were hitting down south every other week. Because of that I was not able to attend my trip in GA. They told me I had up to a year to use my ticket. So when I try to rebook my ticket they are now close to $500. Mind you this is the highest rate out of all the airlines for my particular dates, I asked for a refund because I didn't wanna double what I paid the first time and I was told by the Supervisor (Willie ** in Dallas ) that my only option was to ""use it or lost it"". Being a supervisor myself I thought the tone in which he said it was very careless and he didn't try to help the situation at all. I would never talk to my customers the way he spoke to me especially after losing out on $300!!"
Katy of Knoxville, TN," Oct. 22, 2012","I just completed a flight on American Airlines. I had read negative reviews, but I found the American Airlines people I had contact with were great, tried to provide all the service they could because our flight had been cancelled due WX and had to layover at ORD. My complaint is the phoney coupon given for a hotel room for a ""discounted rate"". The coupon has nothing to do with American Airlines, but is only a hotel booking service. When I called the phone number provided I was told the only available room was 10 miles away and given a rate of $80.00. It was getting late in the evening so took it. Then was advised there was a $15 service charge to book the room. American Airline paid none of this. The shuttle bus to the hotel was packed (Other delayed passengers). When I got home I checked the hotel rate and found the same room went for $105. I ""saved"" $10. The hotel was a Holiday Inn Express. Room not bad."
Donna of Melbourne, FL," Oct. 20, 2012","I was en route from San Antonio Texas to Hong Kong and when checking in for the domestic portion of the flight at the ticket counter, the woman claimed there was a problem with my passport.

She made up some baloney about Homeland Security not letting people fly with spots on their passport. I told her I checked their website and there was no mention of anything like that. She then claimed, ""Oh, they don't tell you."" I said, ""Then how are you supposed to know?"" She then sarcastically claimed I needed glasses, so I put my glasses on and told her those so called spots are not a problem. "

While I was away, I heard the news that my dad had passed away. In which, I contacted American Airlines right away and asked if anything can be done. I wanted to fly back before my actual trip date, due to obvious reasons. I even offered to provide them with a death certificate if need be (although, I don't think that is even something they should ask for right away). I spoke to 3 different customer service reps who were all horrible to speak with. They had zero compassion and empathy and just dismissed me as if what I was experiencing was far from a big deal to them. "
Rao of Helotes, TX," Oct. 14, 2012","I was on the plane for 14 hours due to a delay. Sitting in a broken seat that would not recline. I told the stewardess and she could care less, said nothing she can do. After I got home I contacted the airline and they issued me a fourteen dollar credit. I had paid 197.34 dollars for preferred seats. The worst flight of my life, never again w/ this airline."
Jaime of Miami, FL," Oct. 13, 2012","Overall, (Un)American Airlines continues to disappoint. I really only ever fly with AA as a last resort, and I can't see any reason to recommend traveling with AA. I was prior active duty Army, and now I'm a reservist, and only American Airlines makes me feel like my service is less important now. United, Southwest, Jet Blue, Delta, every other airline doesn't discriminate between Active Duty and Reserve/Guardsmen when it comes to bag fees. So, along with uncomfortable, outdated planes and poor service, I spent a $100 checking bags to and from my destination."
Gabriella of San Diego, CA," Oct. 8, 2012",American Airlines is the worst airlines to fly anywhere. They cram you in the seats with no leg room or any room for that matter. I requested a wheelchair at airport and waited 30 minutes upon someone finally arriving. They took me the wrong way to my next check in and I missed my flight. They said I would have to rebook my ticket and just wait for the next flight. Attendant at the gate was very disrespectful and not helpful at all. I had no control over this situation at all. Not to mention when I did finally arrive at my destination that I requested a wheelchair prior to my departure.
Liliana  of Victorville , CA," Oct. 2, 2012","American Airlines is the worst airline in THE WORLD, and should change their name, it is utterly disgraceful that as an American they use this name. Their policy is to not apologize for anything, to be as rude as possible to people who are basically held hostage to them and their BS policies like closing the door to the gate while people are standing there then charging them money to rebook their flight, not caring at all about the bags on their way to a destination without the owners there to pick them up. Then being told when lodging a complaint that it was going in one ear and out the other. I have never been treated so poorly in my life, I will never again fly with this airline, I hope they go bankrupt and get the worst karma life can give. Oh yeah and I get to fly with them tomorrow. :/"
Susie of Ladson, SC," Sept. 28, 2012","Very disappointed. Unlikely I will ever choose American Airlines again. I didn't make my flight in the spring. I was given a voucher to use for future travel. Now I'm being told I can only use it myself, and not for my family. I don't want to use it for myself. What difference does it make? I'm being told different things by different people. The last guy hung up on me and I wasn't even rude to him. This is how AA does business? All I want is to not be penalized for cancelling a flight that was beyond my control. If you have a voucher it should be flexible to use for anyone. AA is the WORST! Hope they go out of business for this nonsense. Airline travel is a joke."
Virginia of Philadelphia, PA," Sept. 28, 2012","American Airlines canceled my 92-year-old father-in-law's flight to Key West due to Hurricane Irma. On that day American Airline was contacted and the representative said there would be no problem re-booking, just use the reference number. American Airlines even went on TV and said they would waive re-booking fees. Today when calling to re-book the flight and after 57 minutes on the phone, I was told the flight could not be re-booked because it was in their notes I requested a refund. At no time did I request a refund and American Airlines could not locate any record of a refund request. Even so, American Airlines still insisted they could not re-book the flight or issue a refund. If we did not have enough trouble dealing with a Cat 4 hurricane and its devastating aftermath, now American Airlines is adding to the misery. All my father-in-law wants is to come to Key West and see that everyone is alright. Thanks, AA."
Tonia of Charlotte, NC," Sept. 25, 2012",I bought tickets for my mother in law and son to meet my wife and I in Colorado. We had traveled on different airlines due to connections and therefore were going back on different airlines. My wife and I left on our airplane. My mother in law and son were stranded as the plane had a mechanical. This was 8 AM and the bottom line was it didn't get fixed that day. American gave them a 12.00 voucher good in the terminal and did nothing to get them a room as the rooms they usually used weren't available.
James of Williamston, MI," Sept. 20, 2012","I booked 2 separate flights on American Airlines in Economy since I pay for my air travel. On one they pre-assigned me a back-of-plane middle seat and said that I was required to pay some increased fee for window, aisle or closer to the front. On the second flight they said I have to wait until I reach the boarding gate for any seat. This is ridiculous and unacceptable. The airline has sufficient revenue to - just a suggestion - increase the ""base"" fare to cover a first-come-first-served seat selection and not put everyone into 3rd class or worse status. If they want to surcharge certain premium seats, like middle seats toward the front, that's OK, but this behavior is totally unacceptable and I refuse to fly them (or any airline) that abuses their passengers."
Af of Usairway, GA," Sept. 15, 2012",Well I looked into changing my flight for my fiance and I to go home a day earlier... only to discover that American charges $200.00 a ticket PLUS the difference in price tickets! LIKE THAT IS GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE! So for the price of another ticket I can change my flight! I will be looking elsewhere for flights in the future. I have already paid for a flight and now you are trying to rip me off even more!?! Out of touch and terrible service to a customer of over 5 years. I will be going elsewhere where I don't get bent over the table. Thank you American!
Alicia of San Diego, CA," Sept. 14, 2012","I originally booked my flight to Miami from Washington, DC back in July 2017. I was scheduled to fly September 13-18, 2017. I, like many, had to cancel my trip because of hurricane Irma. I was informed by two customer service representatives that I would be able to rebook my flight to Miami with no additional charges in fare and no change fees. Of course, when it comes time to book my flight, I'm informed about a change fee. I told the agent, I was reassured twice that I would not be charged any additional fees because my initial cancellation was weather related. "
John of San Antonio, TX," Sept. 9, 2012","American Airlines is full of **. Our cruise was cancelled due to Hurricane Irma. It was beyond our control and the airline stated there was nothing that they could do. No partial credit, changes or anything! I will not be flying with them anymore!"
Elias of Montville, NJ," Sept. 7, 2012",My husband and I were scheduled to fly out at 7:15 am to go to California for a very important family matter. We do not live near the airport so we were up early to make sure we were early and nothing could go wrong. But things did go wrong. When we got to the airport we went and printed out tickets at the self checkout. We did notice that it mentioned no overhead storage for our carry on bags. So confused because we fly a lot and there is always overhead storage or they place in under the cabin. So we asked a lady that was standing in the area of self print and she looked and our tickets said we would be fine... Again we were told wrong.
Mark of Fishers, IN," Sept. 6, 2012","On September 4 my family of 5 arrived at the airport in Anchorage to fly home to Toronto via Dallas. Four of us had carry-on sized luggage but one had a mid-sized suitcase that we knew we would have to check. Our flight to Toronto included a 12.5-hour connection at DFW (not by choice). Since none of us sleep well on planes, we were considering going to a hotel following the overnight flight to DFW. When checking the suitcase, I specifically asked the American Airlines agent ""if we only check this bag to DFW and then go to a hotel for a few hours of sleep, will we be charged a second baggage fee to check the bag in for the flight to Toronto? If so we can rearrange the bags so that we can just check it through to Toronto."" "
Debra of Az, az," Aug. 31, 2012","I purchased the basic economy ticket. When I was getting ready to board in Charlotte, the attendant mentioned that this was a new program for your airline and that customers have stated it was cost effective. However, this was not my case! I paid nearly $600 to fly from Columbus, OH to Asheville, NC. Absolutely absurd!!! In the future, I will do all I can to avoid flying with your airline and don't count on a positive recommendation from me to others! Also, stop charging for the first piece of checked in luggage!"

I called at night again because I was worried I saw it was still cancel. After almost 2 hours they answered the phone. I told them what happened. They told me that they were very sorry but the flight was canceled and they didnt' have flight for Sept 12. They gave me 1 stop flight for Sept 13. "
Mamie of New Haven, CT," Aug. 29, 2012","I was scheduled to fly out of Tampa International on Sunday, September, 17th to Durango, CO. I live in Sarasota, and just returned home the other day after evacuating for Hurricane Irma. I fled Florida and headed to Georgia, where I had to rent a hotel for a few nights. When I returned home I was fortunate enough not to have suffered damage. I of course have yard debris strewn about and I am still without power. The power company has estimated by the end of the day on September 22nd I will have power. With the extra costs incurred from having to leave my home, and the loss of power, I decided this was not a good time to travel."
Anri of Lafayette, LA," Aug. 29, 2012","Hurricane Irma was mess for AA. I get it. I'm sure there were thousands who were stuck trying to get their flights changed. Unfortunately, I was in Costa Rica with a connection via Miami and I got, as the AA agent said ""the short end of the stick."" I would be stuck almost another week in Costa Rica as everything AA had was booked out or cancelled. I saw a little bit of silver lining when I found that if I could get to Mexico city, I could fly home via DFW. However, AA would not change the ticket as it is against their rules to change the country of origin on a ticket. ""We cannot do it."" However, a more accurate description is ""will not."""
Severight of St catherine, other," Aug. 26, 2012","We were delayed on our AA out of Seattle due to having to wait on flight crew. Managed to make it to Dallas on time BUT had to sit on the tarmac for 20 mins waiting for a gait in order to deplane. This caused to miss our connecting flight. Next available flight is the next day. Asked about compensation for overnight hotel stay (there are 7 in our party, including a 3 year old) and were denied due to the delay being coded as weather related, which is absolutely bogus. So livid, frustrated, and tired at this point. Also found out AA has no number to call for complaints... You have to go through email so who knows if they will even read it or reply. Will never fly AA again if I can help it."
Raul of Charlotte, NC," Aug. 23, 2012","I was on an almost 2 hour flight (Flight AA3936) stuck sitting with one leg over my bag and the other on the edge of the aisle. Not once was I asked to check in my bag nor told it wouldn't fit on the overhead bin. By the time we landed my knees, hips and back were killing me and I had to have help from the gentleman next to me to be able to stand up. So glad there wasn't an emergency 'cause this would have been one hell of a hazard. Lesson learned not to use this airline again."
Ashley of Miami, FL," Aug. 23, 2012","American Airlines‰Û_the new standard for horrible service. Oh‰Û_I mean HORRIBLE! I travel very frequently for work and have stuck to one specific airline in order to build my status with them (ie. first class upgrades often, better seat choices, free checked bags). Recently, service has taken a turn for the worse. I‰Ûªm a reasonable guy and tolerate more than most.

D of Hamilton, NJ," Aug. 20, 2012","I travel 80%~ for Work and have flown with almost every airline multiple times. AA is by far the worst. Not due to their customer service/staff/delays or anything like that (at least that I‰Ûªve noticed), but their planes have no entertainment system on each seat, they do not play movies on the overhead screens, and they don‰Ûªt even have a free WiFi movie/tv option you can connect to using your phone! I‰Ûªm currently on a flight from Boston to Phoenix and was utterly shocked when I sat in my seat and noticed no form of entertainment for a cross-country flight. Delta and other airlines provide personal entertainment screens on each screen or a smartphone connect feature for 2+ hr flights, which in turn make the flights more enjoyable. Anyways, to avoid rambling on and on about the lack of technology on AA planes I‰Ûªll just say if you enjoyed traveling in the late 90s early 2000s, then AA is for you.

Chase of McKinney, TX," June 18, 2012",Well I looked into changing my flight for my fiance and I to go home a day earlier... only to discover that American charges $200.00 a ticket PLUS the difference in price tickets! LIKE THAT IS GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE! So for the price of another ticket I can change my flight! I will be looking elsewhere for flights in the future. I have already paid for a flight and now you are trying to rip me off even more!?! Out of touch and terrible service to a customer of over 5 years. I will be going elsewhere where I don't get bent over the table. Thank you American!
Esther of Hickory Creek, TX," June 14, 2012","I originally booked my flight to Miami from Washington, DC back in July 2017. I was scheduled to fly September 13-18, 2017. I, like many, had to cancel my trip because of hurricane Irma. I was informed by two customer service representatives that I would be able to rebook my flight to Miami with no additional charges in fare and no change fees. Of course, when it comes time to book my flight, I'm informed about a change fee. I told the agent, I was reassured twice that I would not be charged any additional fees because my initial cancellation was weather related. "
Kathleen of Montecito, CA," June 12, 2012","American Airlines is full of **. Our cruise was cancelled due to Hurricane Irma. It was beyond our control and the airline stated there was nothing that they could do. No partial credit, changes or anything! I will not be flying with them anymore!"
Kyle  of Marrero, LA," June 8, 2012",My husband and I were scheduled to fly out at 7:15 am to go to California for a very important family matter. We do not live near the airport so we were up early to make sure we were early and nothing could go wrong. But things did go wrong. When we got to the airport we went and printed out tickets at the self checkout. We did notice that it mentioned no overhead storage for our carry on bags. So confused because we fly a lot and there is always overhead storage or they place in under the cabin. So we asked a lady that was standing in the area of self print and she looked and our tickets said we would be fine... Again we were told wrong.
Lynn of Reno, NV," June 2, 2012","On September 4 my family of 5 arrived at the airport in Anchorage to fly home to Toronto via Dallas. Four of us had carry-on sized luggage but one had a mid-sized suitcase that we knew we would have to check. Our flight to Toronto included a 12.5-hour connection at DFW (not by choice). Since none of us sleep well on planes, we were considering going to a hotel following the overnight flight to DFW. When checking the suitcase, I specifically asked the American Airlines agent ""if we only check this bag to DFW and then go to a hotel for a few hours of sleep, will we be charged a second baggage fee to check the bag in for the flight to Toronto? If so we can rearrange the bags so that we can just check it through to Toronto."" "
Tracy of Norwalk, CA," June 1, 2012","I purchased the basic economy ticket. When I was getting ready to board in Charlotte, the attendant mentioned that this was a new program for your airline and that customers have stated it was cost effective. However, this was not my case! I paid nearly $600 to fly from Columbus, OH to Asheville, NC. Absolutely absurd!!! In the future, I will do all I can to avoid flying with your airline and don't count on a positive recommendation from me to others! Also, stop charging for the first piece of checked in luggage!"

September 11 I checked the flight online and it was canceled. I called customer service. Patricia told me that I was wrong it wasn't cancel. I called at night again because I was worried I saw it was still cancel. After almost 2 hours they answered the phone. I told them what happened. They told me that they were very sorry but the flight was canceled and they didnt' have flight for Sept 12. They gave me 1 stop flight for Sept 13. "
Eugene  of Sunrise, FL," May 25, 2012","I was scheduled to fly out of Tampa International on Sunday, September, 17th to Durango, CO. I live in Sarasota, and just returned home the other day after evacuating for Hurricane Irma. I fled Florida and headed to Georgia, where I had to rent a hotel for a few nights. When I returned home I was fortunate enough not to have suffered damage. I of course have yard debris strewn about and I am still without power. The power company has estimated by the end of the day on September 22nd I will have power. With the extra costs incurred from having to leave my home, and the loss of power, I decided this was not a good time to travel."
Venkatesh of Addison, tx," May 21, 2012","Hurricane Irma was mess for AA. I get it. I'm sure there were thousands who were stuck trying to get their flights changed. Unfortunately, I was in Costa Rica with a connection via Miami and I got, as the AA agent said ""the short end of the stick."" I would be stuck almost another week in Costa Rica as everything AA had was booked out or cancelled. I saw a little bit of silver lining when I found that if I could get to Mexico city, I could fly home via DFW. However, AA would not change the ticket as it is against their rules to change the country of origin on a ticket. ""We cannot do it."" However, a more accurate description is ""will not."""
Pamela of Scottsdale, az," May 21, 2012","We were delayed on our AA out of Seattle due to having to wait on flight crew. Managed to make it to Dallas on time BUT had to sit on the tarmac for 20 mins waiting for a gait in order to deplane. This caused to miss our connecting flight. Next available flight is the next day. Asked about compensation for overnight hotel stay (there are 7 in our party, including a 3 year old) and were denied due to the delay being coded as weather related, which is absolutely bogus. So livid, frustrated, and tired at this point. Also found out AA has no number to call for complaints... You have to go through email so who knows if they will even read it or reply. Will never fly AA again if I can help it."
Terri of Pennington, NJ," May 18, 2012","I was on an almost 2 hour flight (Flight AA3936) stuck sitting with one leg over my bag and the other on the edge of the aisle. Not once was I asked to check in my bag nor told it wouldn't fit on the overhead bin. By the time we landed my knees, hips and back were killing me and I had to have help from the gentleman next to me to be able to stand up. So glad there wasn't an emergency 'cause this would have been one hell of a hazard. Lesson learned not to use this airline again."
Karen of Chester, VA," May 15, 2012","American Airlines‰Û_the new standard for horrible service. Oh‰Û_I mean HORRIBLE! I travel very frequently for work and have stuck to one specific airline in order to build my status with them (ie. first class upgrades often, better seat choices, free checked bags). Recently, service has taken a turn for the worse. I‰Ûªm a reasonable guy and tolerate more than most. Call it my Southern hospitality, my upbringing or my service to the community when I served in law enforcement, but I just plain put up with more‰Û_until now."
Michael of Other, NC," May 6, 2012","I travel 80%~ for Work and have flown with almost every airline multiple times. AA is by far the worst. Not due to their customer service/staff/delays or anything like that (at least that I‰Ûªve noticed), but their planes have no entertainment system on each seat, they do not play movies on the overhead screens, and they don‰Ûªt even have a free WiFi movie/tv option you can connect to using your phone! I‰Ûªm currently on a flight from Boston to Phoenix and was utterly shocked when I sat in my seat and noticed no form of entertainment for a cross-country flight. Delta and other airlines provide personal entertainment screens on each screen or a smartphone connect feature for 2+ hr flights, which in turn make the flights more enjoyable. Anyways, to avoid rambling on and on about the lack of technology on AA planes I‰Ûªll just say if you enjoyed traveling in the late 90s early 2000s, then AA is for you. If you want to travel in 2017 and beyond, find a different airline."
Leslie of Peoria, AZ," May 2, 2012","I had a horrible experience today on my flight back to Miami. I have been an AAdvantage member for many years now and have always chosen to be loyal to American but after today's experience that may change. The onboarding process was fine and the flight was on time, which to be honest is rare but I was happy. When the snacks and beverage cart came the attendant did not smile, looked unhappy to take our beverage order, handed me and my husband 2 cookies, I then I told her, ""Can we just get pretzels?"" She said ""Then I need the cookies back."" I was honestly appalled."
Wonnell of Richmond, VA," April 28, 2012","Don't deserve single star. Also, I have a flight from Chicago to Minneapolis 5 hours from now. And they have seats available on the earlier flight but won't give you without charging $75. They are ok to make you wait or fly a flight with empty seats but no customer delight which is no cost to them. No customer driven company and not looking for going extra mile to make customer happy. Never travel on American Airlines again."
shirley of Ventura, CA," April 24, 2012","Worst experience ever with AA never again, they treated my dad like garbage, they humiliated my dad in front of my niece travelling with him and in front of all passengers, just because my dad is ** and not fluent in English. I wish I could sue them for discrimination against my dad for not speaking English fluent instead of offering assistance in Spanish which, the sky harbor airport in Arizona has plenty of bilingual employees. DO NOT FLY AA EVER, pay more with a different airline. The only reason why my dad and niece flew AA to go to my brother's funeral, thank you AA for the worst day ever. It's a shame I have to put a star instead of no stars service."
Jeremy  of Colton, CA," April 19, 2012","This American Airlines review is out of frustration due to a lot of things. They're a disgrace! The employees are rude, there is no leg room, no entertainment, and treat people like herds of sheep. They have a ""New"" rule where they charge $50 at the gate to carry on your luggage. Are you kidding me? $50 for a carry on? And I can't even use the overhead bin! Disgraceful! Basically these guys are crooks! They're a disgrace. Last time I flew with American their flight was delayed by 2 hours and we ended up missing our connecting flight because it was the last flight out. We ended up having to stay an extra day and had to pay $100 for a hotel. We missed my sisters wedding. On the way back we ended up stuck on the tarmac for 2 hours. Of course!"
Martha of New Mexico, NM," April 18, 2012","I booked a ticket back when the hurricane were hitting down south every other week. Because of that I was not able to attend my trip in GA. They told me I had up to a year to use my ticket. So when I try to rebook my ticket they are now close to $500. Mind you this is the highest rate out of all the airlines for my particular dates, I asked for a refund because I didn't wanna double what I paid the first time and I was told by the Supervisor (Willie ** in Dallas ) that my only option was to ""use it or lost it"". Being a supervisor myself I thought the tone in which he said it was very careless and he didn't try to help the situation at all. I would never talk to my customers the way he spoke to me especially after losing out on $300!!"
Brad of Georgetown, TX," April 17, 2012","I just completed a flight on American Airlines. I had read negative reviews, but I found the American Airlines people I had contact with were great, tried to provide all the service they could because our flight had been cancelled due WX and had to layover at ORD. My complaint is the phoney coupon given for a hotel room for a ""discounted rate"". The coupon has nothing to do with American Airlines, but is only a hotel booking service. When I called the phone number provided I was told the only available room was 10 miles away and given a rate of $80.00. It was getting late in the evening so took it. Then was advised there was a $15 service charge to book the room. American Airline paid none of this. The shuttle bus to the hotel was packed (Other delayed passengers). When I got home I checked the hotel rate and found the same room went for $105. I ""saved"" $10. The hotel was a Holiday Inn Express. Room not bad."
Darryl of Shamong, NJ," April 13, 2012","I was en route from San Antonio Texas to Hong Kong and when checking in for the domestic portion of the flight at the ticket counter, the woman claimed there was a problem with my passport. I asked for details and she claimed ""There are spots on your passport."" I told her the passport was still valid and did not expire until the following year."" She made up some baloney about Homeland Security not letting people fly with spots on their passport. I told her I checked their website and there was no mention of anything like that. She then claimed, ""Oh, they don't tell you."" I said, ""Then how are you supposed to know?"" She then sarcastically claimed I needed glasses, so I put my glasses on and told her those so called spots are not a problem. "

Marina of Brookside, PA," April 6, 2012","Where do I even begin? I had a round trip flight booked from Toronto, Ontario to Busan, South Korea back in the month of July (2017). While I was away, I heard the news that my dad had passed away. In which, I contacted American Airlines right away and asked if anything can be done. I wanted to fly back before my actual trip date, due to obvious reasons. I even offered to provide them with a death certificate if need be (although, I don't think that is even something they should ask for right away). I spoke to 3 different customer service reps who were all horrible to speak with. They had zero compassion and empathy and just dismissed me as if what I was experiencing was far from a big deal to them. "
Eddie of West Bloomfield, MI," April 5, 2012","I was on the plane for 14 hours due to a delay. Sitting in a broken seat that would not recline. I told the stewardess and she could care less, said nothing she can do. After I got home I contacted the airline and they issued me a fourteen dollar credit. I had paid 197.34 dollars for preferred seats. The worst flight of my life, never again w/ this airline."
Bonny of Boston, MA," April 3, 2012","Overall, (Un)American Airlines continues to disappoint. I really only ever fly with AA as a last resort, and I can't see any reason to recommend traveling with AA. I was prior active duty Army, and now I'm a reservist, and only American Airlines makes me feel like my service is less important now. United, Southwest, Jet Blue, Delta, every other airline doesn't discriminate between Active Duty and Reserve/Guardsmen when it comes to bag fees. So, along with uncomfortable, outdated planes and poor service, I spent a $100 checking bags to and from my destination."
Karen of Honokaa, HI," April 3, 2012",American Airlines is the worst airlines to fly anywhere. They cram you in the seats with no leg room or any room for that matter. I requested a wheelchair at airport and waited 30 minutes upon someone finally arriving. They took me the wrong way to my next check in and I missed my flight. They said I would have to rebook my ticket and just wait for the next flight. Attendant at the gate was very disrespectful and not helpful at all. I had no control over this situation at all. Not to mention when I did finally arrive at my destination that I requested a wheelchair prior to my departure.
Patrick of Mooresville, NC," April 2, 2012","American Airlines is the worst airline in THE WORLD, and should change their name, it is utterly disgraceful that as an American they use this name. Their policy is to not apologize for anything, to be as rude as possible to people who are basically held hostage to them and their BS policies like closing the door to the gate while people are standing there then charging them money to rebook their flight, not caring at all about the bags on their way to a destination without the owners there to pick them up. Then being told when lodging a complaint that it was going in one ear and out the other. I have never been treated so poorly in my life, I will never again fly with this airline, I hope they go bankrupt and get the worst karma life can give. Oh yeah and I get to fly with them tomorrow. :/"
Craig of High Ridge, MO," April 1, 2012","Very disappointed. Unlikely I will ever choose American Airlines again. I didn't make my flight in the spring. I was given a voucher to use for future travel. Now I'm being told I can only use it myself, and not for my family. I don't want to use it for myself. What difference does it make? I'm being told different things by different people. The last guy hung up on me and I wasn't even rude to him. This is how AA does business? All I want is to not be penalized for cancelling a flight that was beyond my control. If you have a voucher it should be flexible to use for anyone. AA is the WORST! Hope they go out of business for this nonsense. Airline travel is a joke."
Jeanne  of Tobyhanna, PA," March 31, 2012","American Airlines canceled my 92-year-old father-in-law's flight to Key West due to Hurricane Irma. On that day American Airline was contacted and the representative said there would be no problem re-booking, just use the reference number. American Airlines even went on TV and said they would waive re-booking fees. Today when calling to re-book the flight and after 57 minutes on the phone, I was told the flight could not be re-booked because it was in their notes I requested a refund. At no time did I request a refund and American Airlines could not locate any record of a refund request. Even so, American Airlines still insisted they could not re-book the flight or issue a refund. If we did not have enough trouble dealing with a Cat 4 hurricane and its devastating aftermath, now American Airlines is adding to the misery. All my father-in-law wants is to come to Key West and see that everyone is alright. Thanks, AA."
George of Beverly Hills, CA," March 28, 2012",I bought tickets for my mother in law and son to meet my wife and I in Colorado. We had traveled on different airlines due to connections and therefore were going back on different airlines. My wife and I left on our airplane. My mother in law and son were stranded as the plane had a mechanical. This was 8 AM and the bottom line was it didn't get fixed that day. American gave them a 12.00 voucher good in the terminal and did nothing to get them a room as the rooms they usually used weren't available.
Michael of Seattle, WA," March 21, 2012","I booked 2 separate flights on American Airlines in Economy since I pay for my air travel. On one they pre-assigned me a back-of-plane middle seat and said that I was required to pay some increased fee for window, aisle or closer to the front. On the second flight they said I have to wait until I reach the boarding gate for any seat. This is ridiculous and unacceptable. The airline has sufficient revenue to - just a suggestion - increase the ""base"" fare to cover a first-come-first-served seat selection and not put everyone into 3rd class or worse status. If they want to surcharge certain premium seats, like middle seats toward the front, that's OK, but this behavior is totally unacceptable and I refuse to fly them (or any airline) that abuses their passengers."

Boris of Indianapolis, IN," Feb. 6, 2012","I just completed a flight on American Airlines. I had read negative reviews, but I found the American Airlines people I had contact with were great, tried to provide all the service they could because our flight had been cancelled due WX and had to layover at ORD. My complaint is the phoney coupon given for a hotel room for a ""discounted rate"". The coupon has nothing to do with American Airlines, but is only a hotel booking service. When I called the phone number provided I was told the only available room was 10 miles away and given a rate of $80.00. It was getting late in the evening so took it. Then was advised there was a $15 service charge to book the room. American Airline paid none of this. The shuttle bus to the hotel was packed (Other delayed passengers). When I got home I checked the hotel rate and found the same room went for $105. I ""saved"" $10. The hotel was a Holiday Inn Express. Room not bad."
John of Bronx, NY," Feb. 3, 2012","I was en route from San Antonio Texas to Hong Kong and when checking in for the domestic portion of the flight at the ticket counter, the woman claimed there was a problem with my passport. I asked for details and she claimed ""There are spots on your passport."" I told her the passport was still valid and did not expire until the following year."" She made up some baloney about Homeland Security not letting people fly with spots on their passport. I told her I checked their website and there was no mention of anything like that. She then claimed, ""Oh, they don't tell you."" I said, ""Then how are you supposed to know?"" She then sarcastically claimed I needed glasses, so I put my glasses on and told her those so called spots are not a problem. "

While I was away, I heard the news that my dad had passed away. In which, I contacted American Airlines right away and asked if anything can be done. I wanted to fly back before my actual trip date, due to obvious reasons. I even offered to provide them with a death certificate if need be (although, I don't think that is even something they should ask for right away). I spoke to 3 different customer service reps who were all horrible to speak with. They had zero compassion and empathy and just dismissed me as if what I was experiencing was far from a big deal to them. "
Al of Merced, CA," Jan. 31, 2012","I was on the plane for 14 hours due to a delay. Sitting in a broken seat that would not recline. I told the stewardess and she could care less, said nothing she can do. After I got home I contacted the airline and they issued me a fourteen dollar credit. I had paid 197.34 dollars for preferred seats. The worst flight of my life, never again w/ this airline."
Frank of Meridian, MS," Jan. 31, 2012","Overall, (Un)American Airlines continues to disappoint. I really only ever fly with AA as a last resort, and I can't see any reason to recommend traveling with AA. I was prior active duty Army, and now I'm a reservist, and only American Airlines makes me feel like my service is less important now. United, Southwest, Jet Blue, Delta, every other airline doesn't discriminate between Active Duty and Reserve/Guardsmen when it comes to bag fees. So, along with uncomfortable, outdated planes and poor service, I spent a $100 checking bags to and from my destination."
Frances of Flushing, NY," Jan. 31, 2012",American Airlines is the worst airlines to fly anywhere. They cram you in the seats with no leg room or any room for that matter. I requested a wheelchair at airport and waited 30 minutes upon someone finally arriving. They took me the wrong way to my next check in and I missed my flight. They said I would have to rebook my ticket and just wait for the next flight. Attendant at the gate was very disrespectful and not helpful at all. I had no control over this situation at all. Not to mention when I did finally arrive at my destination that I requested a wheelchair prior to my departure.
Griff of Nashville , TN," Jan. 29, 2012","American Airlines is the worst airline in THE WORLD, and should change their name, it is utterly disgraceful that as an American they use this name. Their policy is to not apologize for anything, to be as rude as possible to people who are basically held hostage to them and their BS policies like closing the door to the gate while people are standing there then charging them money to rebook their flight, not caring at all about the bags on their way to a destination without the owners there to pick them up. Then being told when lodging a complaint that it was going in one ear and out the other. I have never been treated so poorly in my life, I will never again fly with this airline, I hope they go bankrupt and get the worst karma life can give. Oh yeah and I get to fly with them tomorrow. :/"
Lucia of Bogota, Other," Jan. 29, 2012","Very disappointed. Unlikely I will ever choose American Airlines again. I didn't make my flight in the spring. I was given a voucher to use for future travel. Now I'm being told I can only use it myself, and not for my family. I don't want to use it for myself. What difference does it make? I'm being told different things by different people. The last guy hung up on me and I wasn't even rude to him. This is how AA does business? All I want is to not be penalized for cancelling a flight that was beyond my control. If you have a voucher it should be flexible to use for anyone. AA is the WORST! Hope they go out of business for this nonsense. Airline travel is a joke."
Robert of Clarksville, TN," Jan. 28, 2012","American Airlines canceled my 92-year-old father-in-law's flight to Key West due to Hurricane Irma. On that day American Airline was contacted and the representative said there would be no problem re-booking, just use the reference number. American Airlines even went on TV and said they would waive re-booking fees. Today when calling to re-book the flight and after 57 minutes on the phone, I was told the flight could not be re-booked because it was in their notes I requested a refund. At no time did I request a refund and American Airlines could not locate any record of a refund request. Even so, American Airlines still insisted they could not re-book the flight or issue a refund. If we did not have enough trouble dealing with a Cat 4 hurricane and its devastating aftermath, now American Airlines is adding to the misery. All my father-in-law wants is to come to Key West and see that everyone is alright. Thanks, AA."
Judith of Keaau, HI," Jan. 27, 2012",I bought tickets for my mother in law and son to meet my wife and I in Colorado. We had traveled on different airlines due to connections and therefore were going back on different airlines. My wife and I left on our airplane. My mother in law and son were stranded as the plane had a mechanical. This was 8 AM and the bottom line was it didn't get fixed that day. American gave them a 12.00 voucher good in the terminal and did nothing to get them a room as the rooms they usually used weren't available.
Soma of Bolingbrook, IL," Jan. 27, 2012","I booked 2 separate flights on American Airlines in Economy since I pay for my air travel. On one they pre-assigned me a back-of-plane middle seat and said that I was required to pay some increased fee for window, aisle or closer to the front. On the second flight they said I have to wait until I reach the boarding gate for any seat. This is ridiculous and unacceptable. The airline has sufficient revenue to - just a suggestion - increase the ""base"" fare to cover a first-come-first-served seat selection and not put everyone into 3rd class or worse status. If they want to surcharge certain premium seats, like middle seats toward the front, that's OK, but this behavior is totally unacceptable and I refuse to fly them (or any airline) that abuses their passengers."
Denia of Katy, TX," Jan. 24, 2012",Well I looked into changing my flight for my fiance and I to go home a day earlier... only to discover that American charges $200.00 a ticket PLUS the difference in price tickets! LIKE THAT IS GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE! So for the price of another ticket I can change my flight! I will be looking elsewhere for flights in the future. I have already paid for a flight and now you are trying to rip me off even more!?! Out of touch and terrible service to a customer of over 5 years. I will be going elsewhere where I don't get bent over the table. Thank you American!

I was informed by two customer service representatives that I would be able to rebook my flight to Miami with no additional charges in fare and no change fees. Of course, when it comes time to book my flight, I'm informed about a change fee. I told the agent, I was reassured twice that I would not be charged any additional fees because my initial cancellation was weather related. "
Jeff of Fayetteville, NC," Jan. 21, 2012","American Airlines is full of **. Our cruise was cancelled due to Hurricane Irma. It was beyond our control and the airline stated there was nothing that they could do. No partial credit, changes or anything! I will not be flying with them anymore!"
Andrea of Niagara Falls, ON," Jan. 20, 2012",My husband and I were scheduled to fly out at 7:15 am to go to California for a very important family matter. We do not live near the airport so we were up early to make sure we were early and nothing could go wrong. But things did go wrong. When we got to the airport we went and printed out tickets at the self checkout. We did notice that it mentioned no overhead storage for our carry on bags. So confused because we fly a lot and there is always overhead storage or they place in under the cabin. So we asked a lady that was standing in the area of self print and she looked and our tickets said we would be fine... Again we were told wrong.
Susan of Airdrie, AB," Jan. 19, 2012","On September 4 my family of 5 arrived at the airport in Anchorage to fly home to Toronto via Dallas. Four of us had carry-on sized luggage but one had a mid-sized suitcase that we knew we would have to check. Our flight to Toronto included a 12.5-hour connection at DFW (not by choice). Since none of us sleep well on planes, we were considering going to a hotel following the overnight flight to DFW. When checking the suitcase, I specifically asked the American Airlines agent ""if we only check this bag to DFW and then go to a hotel for a few hours of sleep, will we be charged a second baggage fee to check the bag in for the flight to Toronto? If so we can rearrange the bags so that we can just check it through to Toronto."" "

I called at night again because I was worried I saw it was still cancel. After almost 2 hours they answered the phone. I told them what happened. They told me that they were very sorry but the flight was canceled and they didnt' have flight for Sept 12. They gave me 1 stop flight for Sept 13. "
Amith of Cayucos, CA," Jan. 16, 2012","I was scheduled to fly out of Tampa International on Sunday, September, 17th to Durango, CO. I live in Sarasota, and just returned home the other day after evacuating for Hurricane Irma. I fled Florida and headed to Georgia, where I had to rent a hotel for a few nights. When I returned home I was fortunate enough not to have suffered damage. I of course have yard debris strewn about and I am still without power. The power company has estimated by the end of the day on September 22nd I will have power. With the extra costs incurred from having to leave my home, and the loss of power, I decided this was not a good time to travel."
Jay of Washington, DC," Jan. 13, 2012","Hurricane Irma was mess for AA. I get it. I'm sure there were thousands who were stuck trying to get their flights changed. Unfortunately, I was in Costa Rica with a connection via Miami and I got, as the AA agent said ""the short end of the stick."" I would be stuck almost another week in Costa Rica as everything AA had was booked out or cancelled. I saw a little bit of silver lining when I found that if I could get to Mexico city, I could fly home via DFW. However, AA would not change the ticket as it is against their rules to change the country of origin on a ticket. ""We cannot do it."" However, a more accurate description is ""will not."""
William of Macon, GA," Jan. 8, 2012","We were delayed on our AA out of Seattle due to having to wait on flight crew. Managed to make it to Dallas on time BUT had to sit on the tarmac for 20 mins waiting for a gait in order to deplane. This caused to miss our connecting flight. Next available flight is the next day. Asked about compensation for overnight hotel stay (there are 7 in our party, including a 3 year old) and were denied due to the delay being coded as weather related, which is absolutely bogus. So livid, frustrated, and tired at this point. Also found out AA has no number to call for complaints... You have to go through email so who knows if they will even read it or reply. Will never fly AA again if I can help it."
Vivienne of Tucson, AZ," Jan. 6, 2012","I was on an almost 2 hour flight (Flight AA3936) stuck sitting with one leg over my bag and the other on the edge of the aisle. Not once was I asked to check in my bag nor told it wouldn't fit on the overhead bin. By the time we landed my knees, hips and back were killing me and I had to have help from the gentleman next to me to be able to stand up. So glad there wasn't an emergency 'cause this would have been one hell of a hazard. Lesson learned not to use this airline again."
Don of Sylvan Lake, AB," Jan. 4, 2012","American Airlines‰Û_the new standard for horrible service. Oh‰Û_I mean HORRIBLE! I travel very frequently for work and have stuck to one specific airline in order to build my status with them (ie. first class upgrades often, better seat choices, free checked bags). Recently, service has taken a turn for the worse. I‰Ûªm a reasonable guy and tolerate more than most. Call it my Southern hospitality, my upbringing or my service to the community when I served in law enforcement, but I just plain put up with more‰Û_until now."
Robin of Virginia Beach, VA," Jan. 4, 2012","I travel 80%~ for Work and have flown with almost every airline multiple times. AA is by far the worst. Not due to their customer service/staff/delays or anything like that (at least that I‰Ûªve noticed), but their planes have no entertainment system on each seat, they do not play movies on the overhead screens, and they don‰Ûªt even have a free WiFi movie/tv option you can connect to using your phone! I‰Ûªm currently on a flight from Boston to Phoenix and was utterly shocked when I sat in my seat and noticed no form of entertainment for a cross-country flight. Delta and other airlines provide personal entertainment screens on each screen or a smartphone connect feature for 2+ hr flights, which in turn make the flights more enjoyable. Anyways, to avoid rambling on and on about the lack of technology on AA planes I‰Ûªll just say if you enjoyed traveling in the late 90s early 2000s, then AA is for you. If you want to travel in 2017 and beyond, find a different airline."
Dan of Myrtle Beach, SC," Jan. 3, 2012","I had a horrible experience today on my flight back to Miami. I have been an AAdvantage member for many years now and have always chosen to be loyal to American but after today's experience that may change. The onboarding process was fine and the flight was on time, which to be honest is rare but I was happy. When the snacks and beverage cart came the attendant did not smile, looked unhappy to take our beverage order, handed me and my husband 2 cookies, I then I told her, ""Can we just get pretzels?"" She said ""Then I need the cookies back."" I was honestly appalled."
Bruce of Federal Way, WA," Jan. 2, 2012","Don't deserve single star. Also, I have a flight from Chicago to Minneapolis 5 hours from now. And they have seats available on the earlier flight but won't give you without charging $75. They are ok to make you wait or fly a flight with empty seats but no customer delight which is no cost to them. No customer driven company and not looking for going extra mile to make customer happy. Never travel on American Airlines again."
Hugh of Bethesda, MD," Jan. 2, 2012","Worst experience ever with AA never again, they treated my dad like garbage, they humiliated my dad in front of my niece travelling with him and in front of all passengers, just because my dad is ** and not fluent in English. I wish I could sue them for discrimination against my dad for not speaking English fluent instead of offering assistance in Spanish which, the sky harbor airport in Arizona has plenty of bilingual employees. DO NOT FLY AA EVER, pay more with a different airline. The only reason why my dad and niece flew AA to go to my brother's funeral, thank you AA for the worst day ever. It's a shame I have to put a star instead of no stars service."
Mark of Fond du Lac, WI," Dec. 31, 2011","This American Airlines review is out of frustration due to a lot of things. They're a disgrace! The employees are rude, there is no leg room, no entertainment, and treat people like herds of sheep. They have a ""New"" rule where they charge $50 at the gate to carry on your luggage. Are you kidding me? $50 for a carry on? And I can't even use the overhead bin! Disgraceful! Basically these guys are crooks! They're a disgrace. Last time I flew with American their flight was delayed by 2 hours and we ended up missing our connecting flight because it was the last flight out. We ended up having to stay an extra day and had to pay $100 for a hotel. We missed my sisters wedding. On the way back we ended up stuck on the tarmac for 2 hours. Of course!"

Mind you this is the highest rate out of all the airlines for my particular dates, I asked for a refund because I didn't wanna double what I paid the first time and I was told by the Supervisor (Willie ** in Dallas ) that my only option was to ""use it or lost it"".

Arthur of Eufaula, OK," Nov. 3, 2011","I did a reservation with AA Sept 10, 2017 over the phone to Miami for Sept 12, 2017 in the flight # 1399. September 11 I checked the flight online and it was canceled. I called customer service. Patricia told me that I was wrong it wasn't cancel. I called at night again because I was worried I saw it was still cancel. After almost 2 hours they answered the phone. I told them what happened. They told me that they were very sorry but the flight was canceled and they didnt' have flight for Sept 12. They gave me 1 stop flight for Sept 13. "
Maxim of Gainesville, FL," Oct. 31, 2011","I was scheduled to fly out of Tampa International on Sunday, September, 17th to Durango, CO. I live in Sarasota, and just returned home the other day after evacuating for Hurricane Irma. I fled Florida and headed to Georgia, where I had to rent a hotel for a few nights. When I returned home I was fortunate enough not to have suffered damage. I of course have yard debris strewn about and I am still without power. The power company has estimated by the end of the day on September 22nd I will have power. With the extra costs incurred from having to leave my home, and the loss of power, I decided this was not a good time to travel."
Juan of Elisabeth, NJ," Oct. 26, 2011","Hurricane Irma was mess for AA. I get it. I'm sure there were thousands who were stuck trying to get their flights changed. Unfortunately, I was in Costa Rica with a connection via Miami and I got, as the AA agent said ""the short end of the stick."" I would be stuck almost another week in Costa Rica as everything AA had was booked out or cancelled. I saw a little bit of silver lining when I found that if I could get to Mexico city, I could fly home via DFW. However, AA would not change the ticket as it is against their rules to change the country of origin on a ticket. ""We cannot do it."" However, a more accurate description is ""will not."""
Daniel of Pine Bush, NY," Oct. 19, 2011","We were delayed on our AA out of Seattle due to having to wait on flight crew. Managed to make it to Dallas on time BUT had to sit on the tarmac for 20 mins waiting for a gait in order to deplane. This caused to miss our connecting flight. Next available flight is the next day. Asked about compensation for overnight hotel stay (there are 7 in our party, including a 3 year old) and were denied due to the delay being coded as weather related, which is absolutely bogus. So livid, frustrated, and tired at this point. Also found out AA has no number to call for complaints... You have to go through email so who knows if they will even read it or reply. Will never fly AA again if I can help it."
Andre of Plantation, FL," Oct. 18, 2011","I was on an almost 2 hour flight (Flight AA3936) stuck sitting with one leg over my bag and the other on the edge of the aisle. Not once was I asked to check in my bag nor told it wouldn't fit on the overhead bin. By the time we landed my knees, hips and back were killing me and I had to have help from the gentleman next to me to be able to stand up. So glad there wasn't an emergency 'cause this would have been one hell of a hazard. Lesson learned not to use this airline again."
Ken of Arlington Hts , IL," Oct. 11, 2011","American Airlines‰Û_the new standard for horrible service. Oh‰Û_I mean HORRIBLE! I travel very frequently for work and have stuck to one specific airline in order to build my status with them (ie. first class upgrades often, better seat choices, free checked bags). Recently, service has taken a turn for the worse. I‰Ûªm a reasonable guy and tolerate more than most.

Ellen of Belleville, NJ," Oct. 11, 2011","I travel 80%~ for Work and have flown with almost every airline multiple times. AA is by far the worst. Not due to their customer service/staff/delays or anything like that (at least that I‰Ûªve noticed), but their planes have no entertainment system on each seat, they do not play movies on the overhead screens, and they don‰Ûªt even have a free WiFi movie/tv option you can connect to using your phone! I‰Ûªm currently on a flight from Boston to Phoenix and was utterly shocked when I sat in my seat and noticed no form of entertainment for a cross-country flight. Delta and other airlines provide personal entertainment screens on each screen or a smartphone connect feature for 2+ hr flights, which in turn make the flights more enjoyable. Anyways, to avoid rambling on and on about the lack of technology on AA planes I‰Ûªll just say if you enjoyed traveling in the late 90s early 2000s, then AA is for you. If you want to travel in 2017 and beyond, find a different airline."
Matt of Pompano Beach, FL," Oct. 11, 2011","I had a horrible experience today on my flight back to Miami. I have been an AAdvantage member for many years now and have always chosen to be loyal to American but after today's experience that may change. The onboarding process was fine and the flight was on time, which to be honest is rare but I was happy. When the snacks and beverage cart came the attendant did not smile, looked unhappy to take our beverage order, handed me and my husband 2 cookies, I then I told her, ""Can we just get pretzels?"" She said ""Then I need the cookies back."" I was honestly appalled."
Michael of Port Washington, NY," Oct. 8, 2011","Don't deserve single star. Also, I have a flight from Chicago to Minneapolis 5 hours from now. And they have seats available on the earlier flight but won't give you without charging $75. They are ok to make you wait or fly a flight with empty seats but no customer delight which is no cost to them. No customer driven company and not looking for going extra mile to make customer happy. Never travel on American Airlines again."
Dh of Gahanna, OH," Oct. 7, 2011","Worst experience ever with AA never again, they treated my dad like garbage, they humiliated my dad in front of my niece travelling with him and in front of all passengers, just because my dad is ** and not fluent in English. I wish I could sue them for discrimination against my dad for not speaking English fluent instead of offering assistance in Spanish which, the sky harbor airport in Arizona has plenty of bilingual employees. DO NOT FLY AA EVER, pay more with a different airline. The only reason why my dad and niece flew AA to go to my brother's funeral, thank you AA for the worst day ever. It's a shame I have to put a star instead of no stars service."
Ravi of Willemstad, Other," Sept. 28, 2011","This American Airlines review is out of frustration due to a lot of things. They're a disgrace! The employees are rude, there is no leg room, no entertainment, and treat people like herds of sheep. They have a ""New"" rule where they charge $50 at the gate to carry on your luggage. Are you kidding me? $50 for a carry on? And I can't even use the overhead bin! Disgraceful! Basically these guys are crooks! They're a disgrace. Last time I flew with American their flight was delayed by 2 hours and we ended up missing our connecting flight because it was the last flight out. We ended up having to stay an extra day and had to pay $100 for a hotel. We missed my sisters wedding. On the way back we ended up stuck on the tarmac for 2 hours. Of course!"
Blume of Bronx, NY," Sept. 27, 2011","I booked a ticket back when the hurricane were hitting down south every other week. Because of that I was not able to attend my trip in GA. They told me I had up to a year to use my ticket. So when I try to rebook my ticket they are now close to $500. Mind you this is the highest rate out of all the airlines for my particular dates, I asked for a refund because I didn't wanna double what I paid the first time and I was told by the Supervisor (Willie ** in Dallas ) that my only option was to ""use it or lost it"". Being a supervisor myself I thought the tone in which he said it was very careless and he didn't try to help the situation at all. I would never talk to my customers the way he spoke to me especially after losing out on $300!!"
Victoria of Hurst, TX," Sept. 26, 2011","I just completed a flight on American Airlines. I had read negative reviews, but I found the American Airlines people I had contact with were great, tried to provide all the service they could because our flight had been cancelled due WX and had to layover at ORD. My complaint is the phoney coupon given for a hotel room for a ""discounted rate"". The coupon has nothing to do with American Airlines, but is only a hotel booking service. When I called the phone number provided I was told the only available room was 10 miles away and given a rate of $80.00. It was getting late in the evening so took it. Then was advised there was a $15 service charge to book the room. American Airline paid none of this. The shuttle bus to the hotel was packed (Other delayed passengers). When I got home I checked the hotel rate and found the same room went for $105. I ""saved"" $10. The hotel was a Holiday Inn Express. Room not bad."

I wanted to fly back before my actual trip date, due to obvious reasons. I even offered to provide them with a death certificate if need be (although, I don't think that is even something they should ask for right away). I spoke to 3 different customer service reps who were all horrible to speak with. They had zero compassion and empathy and just dismissed me as if what I was experiencing was far from a big deal to them. "
Murray of Dunedin, FL," Sept. 19, 2011","I was on the plane for 14 hours due to a delay. Sitting in a broken seat that would not recline. I told the stewardess and she could care less, said nothing she can do. After I got home I contacted the airline and they issued me a fourteen dollar credit. I had paid 197.34 dollars for preferred seats. The worst flight of my life, never again w/ this airline."
Michelle of Orange, NJ," Sept. 19, 2011","Overall, (Un)American Airlines continues to disappoint. I really only ever fly with AA as a last resort, and I can't see any reason to recommend traveling with AA. I was prior active duty Army, and now I'm a reservist, and only American Airlines makes me feel like my service is less important now. United, Southwest, Jet Blue, Delta, every other airline doesn't discriminate between Active Duty and Reserve/Guardsmen when it comes to bag fees. So, along with uncomfortable, outdated planes and poor service, I spent a $100 checking bags to and from my destination."
Shauna of Carrollton , TX," Sept. 19, 2011",American Airlines is the worst airlines to fly anywhere. They cram you in the seats with no leg room or any room for that matter. I requested a wheelchair at airport and waited 30 minutes upon someone finally arriving. They took me the wrong way to my next check in and I missed my flight. They said I would have to rebook my ticket and just wait for the next flight. Attendant at the gate was very disrespectful and not helpful at all. I had no control over this situation at all. Not to mention when I did finally arrive at my destination that I requested a wheelchair prior to my departure.
Michelle of East Orange, NJ," Sept. 16, 2011","American Airlines is the worst airline in THE WORLD, and should change their name, it is utterly disgraceful that as an American they use this name. Their policy is to not apologize for anything, to be as rude as possible to people who are basically held hostage to them and their BS policies like closing the door to the gate while people are standing there then charging them money to rebook their flight, not caring at all about the bags on their way to a destination without the owners there to pick them up. Then being told when lodging a complaint that it was going in one ear and out the other. I have never been treated so poorly in my life, I will never again fly with this airline, I hope they go bankrupt and get the worst karma life can give. Oh yeah and I get to fly with them tomorrow. :/"
John of Atlanta, GA," Sept. 14, 2011","Very disappointed. Unlikely I will ever choose American Airlines again. I didn't make my flight in the spring. I was given a voucher to use for future travel. Now I'm being told I can only use it myself, and not for my family. I don't want to use it for myself. What difference does it make? I'm being told different things by different people. The last guy hung up on me and I wasn't even rude to him. This is how AA does business? All I want is to not be penalized for cancelling a flight that was beyond my control. If you have a voucher it should be flexible to use for anyone. AA is the WORST! Hope they go out of business for this nonsense. Airline travel is a joke."
Mandy of Las Vegas, NV," Sept. 13, 2011","American Airlines canceled my 92-year-old father-in-law's flight to Key West due to Hurricane Irma. On that day American Airline was contacted and the representative said there would be no problem re-booking, just use the reference number. American Airlines even went on TV and said they would waive re-booking fees. Today when calling to re-book the flight and after 57 minutes on the phone, I was told the flight could not be re-booked because it was in their notes I requested a refund. At no time did I request a refund and American Airlines could not locate any record of a refund request. Even so, American Airlines still insisted they could not re-book the flight or issue a refund. If we did not have enough trouble dealing with a Cat 4 hurricane and its devastating aftermath, now American Airlines is adding to the misery. All my father-in-law wants is to come to Key West and see that everyone is alright. Thanks, AA."
Patsi of Greenwood, AR," Sept. 12, 2011",I bought tickets for my mother in law and son to meet my wife and I in Colorado. We had traveled on different airlines due to connections and therefore were going back on different airlines. My wife and I left on our airplane. My mother in law and son were stranded as the plane had a mechanical. This was 8 AM and the bottom line was it didn't get fixed that day. American gave them a 12.00 voucher good in the terminal and did nothing to get them a room as the rooms they usually used weren't available.
Ron of Hudson, NC," Sept. 12, 2011","I booked 2 separate flights on American Airlines in Economy since I pay for my air travel. On one they pre-assigned me a back-of-plane middle seat and said that I was required to pay some increased fee for window, aisle or closer to the front. On the second flight they said I have to wait until I reach the boarding gate for any seat. This is ridiculous and unacceptable. The airline has sufficient revenue to - just a suggestion - increase the ""base"" fare to cover a first-come-first-served seat selection and not put everyone into 3rd class or worse status. If they want to surcharge certain premium seats, like middle seats toward the front, that's OK, but this behavior is totally unacceptable and I refuse to fly them (or any airline) that abuses their passengers."
John of Commack, NY," Sept. 10, 2011",Well I looked into changing my flight for my fiance and I to go home a day earlier... only to discover that American charges $200.00 a ticket PLUS the difference in price tickets! LIKE THAT IS GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE! So for the price of another ticket I can change my flight! I will be looking elsewhere for flights in the future. I have already paid for a flight and now you are trying to rip me off even more!?! Out of touch and terrible service to a customer of over 5 years. I will be going elsewhere where I don't get bent over the table. Thank you American!

I was informed by two customer service representatives that I would be able to rebook my flight to Miami with no additional charges in fare and no change fees. Of course, when it comes time to book my flight, I'm informed about a change fee. I told the agent, I was reassured twice that I would not be charged any additional fees because my initial cancellation was weather related. "

Edward of Beaverton, OR," Sept. 6, 2011",My husband and I were scheduled to fly out at 7:15 am to go to California for a very important family matter. We do not live near the airport so we were up early to make sure we were early and nothing could go wrong. But things did go wrong. When we got to the airport we went and printed out tickets at the self checkout. We did notice that it mentioned no overhead storage for our carry on bags. So confused because we fly a lot and there is always overhead storage or they place in under the cabin. So we asked a lady that was standing in the area of self print and she looked and our tickets said we would be fine... Again we were told wrong.
Ej of Bergenfield, NJ," Sept. 6, 2011","On September 4 my family of 5 arrived at the airport in Anchorage to fly home to Toronto via Dallas. Four of us had carry-on sized luggage but one had a mid-sized suitcase that we knew we would have to check. Our flight to Toronto included a 12.5-hour connection at DFW (not by choice). Since none of us sleep well on planes, we were considering going to a hotel following the overnight flight to DFW. When checking the suitcase, I specifically asked the American Airlines agent ""if we only check this bag to DFW and then go to a hotel for a few hours of sleep, will we be charged a second baggage fee to check the bag in for the flight to Toronto? If so we can rearrange the bags so that we can just check it through to Toronto."" "

I really only ever fly with AA as a last resort, and I can't see any reason to recommend traveling with AA. I was prior active duty Army, and now I'm a reservist, and only American Airlines makes me feel like my service is less important now. United, Southwest, Jet Blue, Delta, every other airline doesn't discriminate between Active Duty and Reserve/Guardsmen when it comes to bag fees. So, along with uncomfortable, outdated planes and poor service, I spent a $100 checking bags to and from my destination."
Jana of Shelburn, IN," Aug. 8, 2011",American Airlines is the worst airlines to fly anywhere. They cram you in the seats with no leg room or any room for that matter. I requested a wheelchair at airport and waited 30 minutes upon someone finally arriving. They took me the wrong way to my next check in and I missed my flight. They said I would have to rebook my ticket and just wait for the next flight. Attendant at the gate was very disrespectful and not helpful at all. I had no control over this situation at all. Not to mention when I did finally arrive at my destination that I requested a wheelchair prior to my departure.
Yad of Cammeray, OTHER," Aug. 7, 2011","American Airlines is the worst airline in THE WORLD, and should change their name, it is utterly disgraceful that as an American they use this name. Their policy is to not apologize for anything, to be as rude as possible to people who are basically held hostage to them and their BS policies like closing the door to the gate while people are standing there then charging them money to rebook their flight, not caring at all about the bags on their way to a destination without the owners there to pick them up. Then being told when lodging a complaint that it was going in one ear and out the other. I have never been treated so poorly in my life, I will never again fly with this airline, I hope they go bankrupt and get the worst karma life can give. Oh yeah and I get to fly with them tomorrow. :/"
Augustine of Kingston, OTHER," Aug. 6, 2011","Very disappointed. Unlikely I will ever choose American Airlines again. I didn't make my flight in the spring. I was given a voucher to use for future travel. Now I'm being told I can only use it myself, and not for my family. I don't want to use it for myself. What difference does it make? I'm being told different things by different people. The last guy hung up on me and I wasn't even rude to him. This is how AA does business? All I want is to not be penalized for cancelling a flight that was beyond my control. If you have a voucher it should be flexible to use for anyone. AA is the WORST! Hope they go out of business for this nonsense. Airline travel is a joke."
Fran of Atlantic Beach, FL," Aug. 6, 2011","American Airlines canceled my 92-year-old father-in-law's flight to Key West due to Hurricane Irma. On that day American Airline was contacted and the representative said there would be no problem re-booking, just use the reference number. American Airlines even went on TV and said they would waive re-booking fees. Today when calling to re-book the flight and after 57 minutes on the phone, I was told the flight could not be re-booked because it was in their notes I requested a refund. At no time did I request a refund and American Airlines could not locate any record of a refund request. Even so, American Airlines still insisted they could not re-book the flight or issue a refund. If we did not have enough trouble dealing with a Cat 4 hurricane and its devastating aftermath, now American Airlines is adding to the misery. All my father-in-law wants is to come to Key West and see that everyone is alright. Thanks, AA."
Murali of N Attleboro, MA," July 30, 2011",I bought tickets for my mother in law and son to meet my wife and I in Colorado. We had traveled on different airlines due to connections and therefore were going back on different airlines. My wife and I left on our airplane. My mother in law and son were stranded as the plane had a mechanical. This was 8 AM and the bottom line was it didn't get fixed that day. American gave them a 12.00 voucher good in the terminal and did nothing to get them a room as the rooms they usually used weren't available.
Andrew of Cardiff, OTHER," July 30, 2011","I booked 2 separate flights on American Airlines in Economy since I pay for my air travel. On one they pre-assigned me a back-of-plane middle seat and said that I was required to pay some increased fee for window, aisle or closer to the front. On the second flight they said I have to wait until I reach the boarding gate for any seat. This is ridiculous and unacceptable. The airline has sufficient revenue to - just a suggestion - increase the ""base"" fare to cover a first-come-first-served seat selection and not put everyone into 3rd class or worse status. If they want to surcharge certain premium seats, like middle seats toward the front, that's OK, but this behavior is totally unacceptable and I refuse to fly them (or any airline) that abuses their passengers."
Chris of Baltimore, MD," July 29, 2011",Well I looked into changing my flight for my fiance and I to go home a day earlier... only to discover that American charges $200.00 a ticket PLUS the difference in price tickets! LIKE THAT IS GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE! So for the price of another ticket I can change my flight! I will be looking elsewhere for flights in the future. I have already paid for a flight and now you are trying to rip me off even more!?! Out of touch and terrible service to a customer of over 5 years. I will be going elsewhere where I don't get bent over the table. Thank you American!
Katherine of New York, NY," July 29, 2011","I originally booked my flight to Miami from Washington, DC back in July 2017. I was scheduled to fly September 13-18, 2017. I, like many, had to cancel my trip because of hurricane Irma. I was informed by two customer service representatives that I would be able to rebook my flight to Miami with no additional charges in fare and no change fees. Of course, when it comes time to book my flight, I'm informed about a change fee. I told the agent, I was reassured twice that I would not be charged any additional fees because my initial cancellation was weather related. "
Alyssa of Rancho Cordova, CA," July 28, 2011","American Airlines is full of **. Our cruise was cancelled due to Hurricane Irma. It was beyond our control and the airline stated there was nothing that they could do. No partial credit, changes or anything! I will not be flying with them anymore!"
C of Irving , TX," July 27, 2011",My husband and I were scheduled to fly out at 7:15 am to go to California for a very important family matter. We do not live near the airport so we were up early to make sure we were early and nothing could go wrong. But things did go wrong. When we got to the airport we went and printed out tickets at the self checkout. We did notice that it mentioned no overhead storage for our carry on bags. So confused because we fly a lot and there is always overhead storage or they place in under the cabin. So we asked a lady that was standing in the area of self print and she looked and our tickets said we would be fine... Again we were told wrong.
Thais of New York, NY," July 25, 2011","On September 4 my family of 5 arrived at the airport in Anchorage to fly home to Toronto via Dallas. Four of us had carry-on sized luggage but one had a mid-sized suitcase that we knew we would have to check. Our flight to Toronto included a 12.5-hour connection at DFW (not by choice). Since none of us sleep well on planes, we were considering going to a hotel following the overnight flight to DFW. When checking the suitcase, I specifically asked the American Airlines agent ""if we only check this bag to DFW and then go to a hotel for a few hours of sleep, will we be charged a second baggage fee to check the bag in for the flight to Toronto? If so we can rearrange the bags so that we can just check it through to Toronto."" "
Daniel of Brighton, CO," July 24, 2011","I purchased the basic economy ticket. When I was getting ready to board in Charlotte, the attendant mentioned that this was a new program for your airline and that customers have stated it was cost effective. However, this was not my case! I paid nearly $600 to fly from Columbus, OH to Asheville, NC. Absolutely absurd!!! In the future, I will do all I can to avoid flying with your airline and don't count on a positive recommendation from me to others! Also, stop charging for the first piece of checked in luggage!"

I called at night again because I was worried I saw it was still cancel. After almost 2 hours they answered the phone. I told them what happened. They told me that they were very sorry but the flight was canceled and they didnt' have flight for Sept 12. They gave me 1 stop flight for Sept 13. "
Angela of Broken Arrow, OK," July 10, 2011","I was scheduled to fly out of Tampa International on Sunday, September, 17th to Durango, CO. I live in Sarasota, and just returned home the other day after evacuating for Hurricane Irma. I fled Florida and headed to Georgia, where I had to rent a hotel for a few nights. When I returned home I was fortunate enough not to have suffered damage. I of course have yard debris strewn about and I am still without power. The power company has estimated by the end of the day on September 22nd I will have power. With the extra costs incurred from having to leave my home, and the loss of power, I decided this was not a good time to travel."
Elizabeth of Irving, TX," July 1, 2011","Hurricane Irma was mess for AA. I get it. I'm sure there were thousands who were stuck trying to get their flights changed. Unfortunately, I was in Costa Rica with a connection via Miami and I got, as the AA agent said ""the short end of the stick."" I would be stuck almost another week in Costa Rica as everything AA had was booked out or cancelled. I saw a little bit of silver lining when I found that if I could get to Mexico city, I could fly home via DFW. However, AA would not change the ticket as it is against their rules to change the country of origin on a ticket. ""We cannot do it."" However, a more accurate description is ""will not."""
John of Lake Forest , CA," June 28, 2011","We were delayed on our AA out of Seattle due to having to wait on flight crew. Managed to make it to Dallas on time BUT had to sit on the tarmac for 20 mins waiting for a gait in order to deplane. This caused to miss our connecting flight. Next available flight is the next day. Asked about compensation for overnight hotel stay (there are 7 in our party, including a 3 year old) and were denied due to the delay being coded as weather related, which is absolutely bogus. So livid, frustrated, and tired at this point. Also found out AA has no number to call for complaints... You have to go through email so who knows if they will even read it or reply. Will never fly AA again if I can help it."
Biju of Ann Arbor, MI," June 27, 2011","I was on an almost 2 hour flight (Flight AA3936) stuck sitting with one leg over my bag and the other on the edge of the aisle. Not once was I asked to check in my bag nor told it wouldn't fit on the overhead bin. By the time we landed my knees, hips and back were killing me and I had to have help from the gentleman next to me to be able to stand up. So glad there wasn't an emergency 'cause this would have been one hell of a hazard. Lesson learned not to use this airline again."
Tonya of Moore, OK," June 26, 2011","American Airlines‰Û_the new standard for horrible service. Oh‰Û_I mean HORRIBLE! I travel very frequently for work and have stuck to one specific airline in order to build my status with them (ie. first class upgrades often, better seat choices, free checked bags). Recently, service has taken a turn for the worse. I‰Ûªm a reasonable guy and tolerate more than most. Call it my Southern hospitality, my upbringing or my service to the community when I served in law enforcement, but I just plain put up with more‰Û_until now."
Bernadette of New Haven,," June 25, 2011","I travel 80%~ for Work and have flown with almost every airline multiple times. AA is by far the worst. Not due to their customer service/staff/delays or anything like that (at least that I‰Ûªve noticed), but their planes have no entertainment system on each seat, they do not play movies on the overhead screens, and they don‰Ûªt even have a free WiFi movie/tv option you can connect to using your phone! I‰Ûªm currently on a flight from Boston to Phoenix and was utterly shocked when I sat in my seat and noticed no form of entertainment for a cross-country flight. Delta and other airlines provide personal entertainment screens on each screen or a smartphone connect feature for 2+ hr flights, which in turn make the flights more enjoyable. Anyways, to avoid rambling on and on about the lack of technology on AA planes I‰Ûªll just say if you enjoyed traveling in the late 90s early 2000s, then AA is for you. If you want to travel in 2017 and beyond, find a different airline."
Geraldine of Las Vegas, NV," June 23, 2011","I had a horrible experience today on my flight back to Miami. I have been an AAdvantage member for many years now and have always chosen to be loyal to American but after today's experience that may change. The onboarding process was fine and the flight was on time, which to be honest is rare but I was happy. When the snacks and beverage cart came the attendant did not smile, looked unhappy to take our beverage order, handed me and my husband 2 cookies, I then I told her, ""Can we just get pretzels?"" She said ""Then I need the cookies back."" I was honestly appalled."
Dana of Avilla, IN," June 23, 2011","Don't deserve single star. Also, I have a flight from Chicago to Minneapolis 5 hours from now. And they have seats available on the earlier flight but won't give you without charging $75. They are ok to make you wait or fly a flight with empty seats but no customer delight which is no cost to them. No customer driven company and not looking for going extra mile to make customer happy. Never travel on American Airlines again."
D of San Francisco, CA," June 23, 2011","Worst experience ever with AA never again, they treated my dad like garbage, they humiliated my dad in front of my niece travelling with him and in front of all passengers, just because my dad is ** and not fluent in English. I wish I could sue them for discrimination against my dad for not speaking English fluent instead of offering assistance in Spanish which, the sky harbor airport in Arizona has plenty of bilingual employees. DO NOT FLY AA EVER, pay more with a different airline. The only reason why my dad and niece flew AA to go to my brother's funeral, thank you AA for the worst day ever. It's a shame I have to put a star instead of no stars service."
Margaret of Palatine, IL," June 23, 2011","This American Airlines review is out of frustration due to a lot of things. They're a disgrace! The employees are rude, there is no leg room, no entertainment, and treat people like herds of sheep. They have a ""New"" rule where they charge $50 at the gate to carry on your luggage. Are you kidding me? $50 for a carry on? And I can't even use the overhead bin! Disgraceful! Basically these guys are crooks! They're a disgrace. Last time I flew with American their flight was delayed by 2 hours and we ended up missing our connecting flight because it was the last flight out. We ended up having to stay an extra day and had to pay $100 for a hotel. We missed my sisters wedding. On the way back we ended up stuck on the tarmac for 2 hours. Of course!"
Dee of Houston, TX," June 22, 2011","I booked a ticket back when the hurricane were hitting down south every other week. Because of that I was not able to attend my trip in GA. They told me I had up to a year to use my ticket. So when I try to rebook my ticket they are now close to $500. Mind you this is the highest rate out of all the airlines for my particular dates, I asked for a refund because I didn't wanna double what I paid the first time and I was told by the Supervisor (Willie ** in Dallas ) that my only option was to ""use it or lost it"". Being a supervisor myself I thought the tone in which he said it was very careless and he didn't try to help the situation at all. I would never talk to my customers the way he spoke to me especially after losing out on $300!!"
Demoralizedpassenger of Private, MI," June 22, 2011","I just completed a flight on American Airlines. I had read negative reviews, but I found the American Airlines people I had contact with were great, tried to provide all the service they could because our flight had been cancelled due WX and had to layover at ORD. My complaint is the phoney coupon given for a hotel room for a ""discounted rate"". The coupon has nothing to do with American Airlines, but is only a hotel booking service. When I called the phone number provided I was told the only available room was 10 miles away and given a rate of $80.00. It was getting late in the evening so took it. Then was advised there was a $15 service charge to book the room. American Airline paid none of this. The shuttle bus to the hotel was packed (Other delayed passengers). When I got home I checked the hotel rate and found the same room went for $105. I ""saved"" $10. The hotel was a Holiday Inn Express. Room not bad."

She made up some baloney about Homeland Security not letting people fly with spots on their passport. I told her I checked their website and there was no mention of anything like that. She then claimed, ""Oh, they don't tell you."" I said, ""Then how are you supposed to know?""

I wanted to fly back before my actual trip date, due to obvious reasons. I even offered to provide them with a death certificate if need be (although, I don't think that is even something they should ask for right away). I spoke to 3 different customer service reps who were all horrible to speak with. They had zero compassion and empathy and just dismissed me as if what I was experiencing was far from a big deal to them. "

I travel very frequently for work and have stuck to one specific airline in order to build my status with them (ie. first class upgrades often, better seat choices, free checked bags). Recently, service has taken a turn for the worse. I‰Ûªm a reasonable guy and tolerate more than most. Call it my Southern hospitality, my upbringing or my service to the community when I served in law enforcement, but I just plain put up with more‰Û_until now."
Alan of Hilton Head Island, SC," Jan. 9, 2011","I travel 80%~ for Work and have flown with almost every airline multiple times. AA is by far the worst. Not due to their customer service/staff/delays or anything like that (at least that I‰Ûªve noticed), but their planes have no entertainment system on each seat, they do not play movies on the overhead screens, and they don‰Ûªt even have a free WiFi movie/tv option you can connect to using your phone! I‰Ûªm currently on a flight from Boston to Phoenix and was utterly shocked when I sat in my seat and noticed no form of entertainment for a cross-country flight. Delta and other airlines provide personal entertainment screens on each screen or a smartphone connect feature for 2+ hr flights, which in turn make the flights more enjoyable. Anyways, to avoid rambling on and on about the lack of technology on AA planes I‰Ûªll just say if you enjoyed traveling in the late 90s early 2000s, then AA is for you. If you want to travel in 2017 and beyond, find a different airline."
Melania of Loveland, CO," Jan. 8, 2011","I had a horrible experience today on my flight back to Miami. I have been an AAdvantage member for many years now and have always chosen to be loyal to American but after today's experience that may change. The onboarding process was fine and the flight was on time, which to be honest is rare but I was happy. When the snacks and beverage cart came the attendant did not smile, looked unhappy to take our beverage order, handed me and my husband 2 cookies, I then I told her, ""Can we just get pretzels?"" She said ""Then I need the cookies back."" I was honestly appalled."
Ana of Key Largo, FL," Jan. 6, 2011","Don't deserve single star. Also, I have a flight from Chicago to Minneapolis 5 hours from now. And they have seats available on the earlier flight but won't give you without charging $75. They are ok to make you wait or fly a flight with empty seats but no customer delight which is no cost to them. No customer driven company and not looking for going extra mile to make customer happy. Never travel on American Airlines again."
Edgar of New Haven, CT," Jan. 6, 2011","Worst experience ever with AA never again, they treated my dad like garbage, they humiliated my dad in front of my niece travelling with him and in front of all passengers, just because my dad is ** and not fluent in English. I wish I could sue them for discrimination against my dad for not speaking English fluent instead of offering assistance in Spanish which, the sky harbor airport in Arizona has plenty of bilingual employees. DO NOT FLY AA EVER, pay more with a different airline. The only reason why my dad and niece flew AA to go to my brother's funeral, thank you AA for the worst day ever. It's a shame I have to put a star instead of no stars service."
Edgar of New Haven, CT," Jan. 6, 2011","This American Airlines review is out of frustration due to a lot of things. They're a disgrace! The employees are rude, there is no leg room, no entertainment, and treat people like herds of sheep. They have a ""New"" rule where they charge $50 at the gate to carry on your luggage. Are you kidding me? $50 for a carry on? And I can't even use the overhead bin! Disgraceful! Basically these guys are crooks! They're a disgrace. Last time I flew with American their flight was delayed by 2 hours and we ended up missing our connecting flight because it was the last flight out. We ended up having to stay an extra day and had to pay $100 for a hotel. We missed my sisters wedding. On the way back we ended up stuck on the tarmac for 2 hours. Of course!"
Debra of Middletown, ny," Jan. 3, 2011","I booked a ticket back when the hurricane were hitting down south every other week. Because of that I was not able to attend my trip in GA. They told me I had up to a year to use my ticket. So when I try to rebook my ticket they are now close to $500. Mind you this is the highest rate out of all the airlines for my particular dates, I asked for a refund because I didn't wanna double what I paid the first time and I was told by the Supervisor (Willie ** in Dallas ) that my only option was to ""use it or lost it"". Being a supervisor myself I thought the tone in which he said it was very careless and he didn't try to help the situation at all. I would never talk to my customers the way he spoke to me especially after losing out on $300!!"
Luana of Los angeles, ca," Jan. 3, 2011","I just completed a flight on American Airlines. I had read negative reviews, but I found the American Airlines people I had contact with were great, tried to provide all the service they could because our flight had been cancelled due WX and had to layover at ORD. My complaint is the phoney coupon given for a hotel room for a ""discounted rate"". The coupon has nothing to do with American Airlines, but is only a hotel booking service. When I called the phone number provided I was told the only available room was 10 miles away and given a rate of $80.00. It was getting late in the evening so took it. Then was advised there was a $15 service charge to book the room. American Airline paid none of this. The shuttle bus to the hotel was packed (Other delayed passengers). When I got home I checked the hotel rate and found the same room went for $105. I ""saved"" $10. The hotel was a Holiday Inn Express. Room not bad."

She made up some baloney about Homeland Security not letting people fly with spots on their passport. I told her I checked their website and there was no mention of anything like that. She then claimed, ""Oh, they don't tell you."" I said, ""Then how are you supposed to know?""

While I was away, I heard the news that my dad had passed away. In which, I contacted American Airlines right away and asked if anything can be done. I wanted to fly back before my actual trip date, due to obvious reasons. I even offered to provide them with a death certificate if need be (although, I don't think that is even something they should ask for right away). I spoke to 3 different customer service reps who were all horrible to speak with. They had zero compassion and empathy and just dismissed me as if what I was experiencing was far from a big deal to them. "
Jenine of Metamora, MI," Dec. 18, 2010","I was on the plane for 14 hours due to a delay. Sitting in a broken seat that would not recline. I told the stewardess and she could care less, said nothing she can do. After I got home I contacted the airline and they issued me a fourteen dollar credit. I had paid 197.34 dollars for preferred seats. The worst flight of my life, never again w/ this airline."
Rebeca of Boston, MA," Dec. 14, 2010","Overall, (Un)American Airlines continues to disappoint. I really only ever fly with AA as a last resort, and I can't see any reason to recommend traveling with AA. I was prior active duty Army, and now I'm a reservist, and only American Airlines makes me feel like my service is less important now. United, Southwest, Jet Blue, Delta, every other airline doesn't discriminate between Active Duty and Reserve/Guardsmen when it comes to bag fees. So, along with uncomfortable, outdated planes and poor service, I spent a $100 checking bags to and from my destination."
A. of Thornwood, NY," Dec. 12, 2010",American Airlines is the worst airlines to fly anywhere. They cram you in the seats with no leg room or any room for that matter. I requested a wheelchair at airport and waited 30 minutes upon someone finally arriving. They took me the wrong way to my next check in and I missed my flight. They said I would have to rebook my ticket and just wait for the next flight. Attendant at the gate was very disrespectful and not helpful at all. I had no control over this situation at all. Not to mention when I did finally arrive at my destination that I requested a wheelchair prior to my departure.
Randy of Mahwah, NJ," Dec. 10, 2010","American Airlines is the worst airline in THE WORLD, and should change their name, it is utterly disgraceful that as an American they use this name. Their policy is to not apologize for anything, to be as rude as possible to people who are basically held hostage to them and their BS policies like closing the door to the gate while people are standing there then charging them money to rebook their flight, not caring at all about the bags on their way to a destination without the owners there to pick them up. Then being told when lodging a complaint that it was going in one ear and out the other. I have never been treated so poorly in my life, I will never again fly with this airline, I hope they go bankrupt and get the worst karma life can give. Oh yeah and I get to fly with them tomorrow. :/"
Henry of Saint Louis, MO," Dec. 3, 2010","Very disappointed. Unlikely I will ever choose American Airlines again. I didn't make my flight in the spring. I was given a voucher to use for future travel. Now I'm being told I can only use it myself, and not for my family. I don't want to use it for myself. What difference does it make? I'm being told different things by different people. The last guy hung up on me and I wasn't even rude to him. This is how AA does business? All I want is to not be penalized for cancelling a flight that was beyond my control. If you have a voucher it should be flexible to use for anyone. AA is the WORST! Hope they go out of business for this nonsense. Airline travel is a joke."
Carol of Indianapolis, IN," Dec. 2, 2010","American Airlines canceled my 92-year-old father-in-law's flight to Key West due to Hurricane Irma. On that day American Airline was contacted and the representative said there would be no problem re-booking, just use the reference number. American Airlines even went on TV and said they would waive re-booking fees. Today when calling to re-book the flight and after 57 minutes on the phone, I was told the flight could not be re-booked because it was in their notes I requested a refund. At no time did I request a refund and American Airlines could not locate any record of a refund request. Even so, American Airlines still insisted they could not re-book the flight or issue a refund. If we did not have enough trouble dealing with a Cat 4 hurricane and its devastating aftermath, now American Airlines is adding to the misery. All my father-in-law wants is to come to Key West and see that everyone is alright. Thanks, AA."
Rodney of San Francisco, CA," Dec. 1, 2010",I bought tickets for my mother in law and son to meet my wife and I in Colorado. We had traveled on different airlines due to connections and therefore were going back on different airlines. My wife and I left on our airplane. My mother in law and son were stranded as the plane had a mechanical. This was 8 AM and the bottom line was it didn't get fixed that day. American gave them a 12.00 voucher good in the terminal and did nothing to get them a room as the rooms they usually used weren't available.
Daniel of Garden Grove, CA," Dec. 1, 2010","I booked 2 separate flights on American Airlines in Economy since I pay for my air travel. On one they pre-assigned me a back-of-plane middle seat and said that I was required to pay some increased fee for window, aisle or closer to the front. On the second flight they said I have to wait until I reach the boarding gate for any seat. This is ridiculous and unacceptable. The airline has sufficient revenue to - just a suggestion - increase the ""base"" fare to cover a first-come-first-served seat selection and not put everyone into 3rd class or worse status. If they want to surcharge certain premium seats, like middle seats toward the front, that's OK, but this behavior is totally unacceptable and I refuse to fly them (or any airline) that abuses their passengers."
Lisa of Prattville , AL," Nov. 27, 2010",Well I looked into changing my flight for my fiance and I to go home a day earlier... only to discover that American charges $200.00 a ticket PLUS the difference in price tickets! LIKE THAT IS GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE! So for the price of another ticket I can change my flight! I will be looking elsewhere for flights in the future. I have already paid for a flight and now you are trying to rip me off even more!?! Out of touch and terrible service to a customer of over 5 years. I will be going elsewhere where I don't get bent over the table. Thank you American!
Hector of Kissimmee, FL," Nov. 20, 2010","I originally booked my flight to Miami from Washington, DC back in July 2017. I was scheduled to fly September 13-18, 2017. I, like many, had to cancel my trip because of hurricane Irma. I was informed by two customer service representatives that I would be able to rebook my flight to Miami with no additional charges in fare and no change fees. Of course, when it comes time to book my flight, I'm informed about a change fee. I told the agent, I was reassured twice that I would not be charged any additional fees because my initial cancellation was weather related. "
Sharron of Old Brookville, NY," Nov. 17, 2010","American Airlines is full of **. Our cruise was cancelled due to Hurricane Irma. It was beyond our control and the airline stated there was nothing that they could do. No partial credit, changes or anything! I will not be flying with them anymore!"
Marcus of Belo Horizonte, Other," Nov. 14, 2010",My husband and I were scheduled to fly out at 7:15 am to go to California for a very important family matter. We do not live near the airport so we were up early to make sure we were early and nothing could go wrong. But things did go wrong. When we got to the airport we went and printed out tickets at the self checkout. We did notice that it mentioned no overhead storage for our carry on bags. So confused because we fly a lot and there is always overhead storage or they place in under the cabin. So we asked a lady that was standing in the area of self print and she looked and our tickets said we would be fine... Again we were told wrong.
Kate of Mesa, AZ," Nov. 13, 2010","On September 4 my family of 5 arrived at the airport in Anchorage to fly home to Toronto via Dallas. Four of us had carry-on sized luggage but one had a mid-sized suitcase that we knew we would have to check. Our flight to Toronto included a 12.5-hour connection at DFW (not by choice). Since none of us sleep well on planes, we were considering going to a hotel following the overnight flight to DFW. When checking the suitcase, I specifically asked the American Airlines agent ""if we only check this bag to DFW and then go to a hotel for a few hours of sleep, will we be charged a second baggage fee to check the bag in for the flight to Toronto? If so we can rearrange the bags so that we can just check it through to Toronto."" "
Sady of Deltona, FL," Nov. 9, 2010","I purchased the basic economy ticket. When I was getting ready to board in Charlotte, the attendant mentioned that this was a new program for your airline and that customers have stated it was cost effective. However, this was not my case! I paid nearly $600 to fly from Columbus, OH to Asheville, NC. Absolutely absurd!!! In the future, I will do all I can to avoid flying with your airline and don't count on a positive recommendation from me to others! Also, stop charging for the first piece of checked in luggage!"

I called at night again because I was worried I saw it was still cancel. After almost 2 hours they answered the phone. I told them what happened. They told me that they were very sorry but the flight was canceled and they didnt' have flight for Sept 12. They gave me 1 stop flight for Sept 13. "
Barbara of Stillwater, MN," Nov. 7, 2010","I was scheduled to fly out of Tampa International on Sunday, September, 17th to Durango, CO. I live in Sarasota, and just returned home the other day after evacuating for Hurricane Irma. I fled Florida and headed to Georgia, where I had to rent a hotel for a few nights. When I returned home I was fortunate enough not to have suffered damage. I of course have yard debris strewn about and I am still without power. The power company has estimated by the end of the day on September 22nd I will have power. With the extra costs incurred from having to leave my home, and the loss of power, I decided this was not a good time to travel."
Noella of Jeffersonville, IN," Nov. 7, 2010","Hurricane Irma was mess for AA. I get it. I'm sure there were thousands who were stuck trying to get their flights changed. Unfortunately, I was in Costa Rica with a connection via Miami and I got, as the AA agent said ""the short end of the stick."" I would be stuck almost another week in Costa Rica as everything AA had was booked out or cancelled. I saw a little bit of silver lining when I found that if I could get to Mexico city, I could fly home via DFW. However, AA would not change the ticket as it is against their rules to change the country of origin on a ticket. ""We cannot do it."" However, a more accurate description is ""will not."""
Marcia of Broomfield , CO," Nov. 6, 2010","We were delayed on our AA out of Seattle due to having to wait on flight crew. Managed to make it to Dallas on time BUT had to sit on the tarmac for 20 mins waiting for a gait in order to deplane. This caused to miss our connecting flight. Next available flight is the next day. Asked about compensation for overnight hotel stay (there are 7 in our party, including a 3 year old) and were denied due to the delay being coded as weather related, which is absolutely bogus. So livid, frustrated, and tired at this point. Also found out AA has no number to call for complaints... You have to go through email so who knows if they will even read it or reply. Will never fly AA again if I can help it."
Joan of Metuchen, NJ," Nov. 5, 2010","I was on an almost 2 hour flight (Flight AA3936) stuck sitting with one leg over my bag and the other on the edge of the aisle.

David of Los angeles, ca," Oct. 4, 2010",I bought tickets for my mother in law and son to meet my wife and I in Colorado. We had traveled on different airlines due to connections and therefore were going back on different airlines. My wife and I left on our airplane. My mother in law and son were stranded as the plane had a mechanical. This was 8 AM and the bottom line was it didn't get fixed that day. American gave them a 12.00 voucher good in the terminal and did nothing to get them a room as the rooms they usually used weren't available.
Alexis of San Diego, CA," Oct. 3, 2010","I booked 2 separate flights on American Airlines in Economy since I pay for my air travel. On one they pre-assigned me a back-of-plane middle seat and said that I was required to pay some increased fee for window, aisle or closer to the front. On the second flight they said I have to wait until I reach the boarding gate for any seat. This is ridiculous and unacceptable. The airline has sufficient revenue to - just a suggestion - increase the ""base"" fare to cover a first-come-first-served seat selection and not put everyone into 3rd class or worse status. If they want to surcharge certain premium seats, like middle seats toward the front, that's OK, but this behavior is totally unacceptable and I refuse to fly them (or any airline) that abuses their passengers."
Tina of Like Worth, FL," Sept. 24, 2010",Well I looked into changing my flight for my fiance and I to go home a day earlier... only to discover that American charges $200.00 a ticket PLUS the difference in price tickets! LIKE THAT IS GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE! So for the price of another ticket I can change my flight! I will be looking elsewhere for flights in the future. I have already paid for a flight and now you are trying to rip me off even more!?! Out of touch and terrible service to a customer of over 5 years. I will be going elsewhere where I don't get bent over the table. Thank you American!
Rajeshri of Tulsa, OK," Sept. 22, 2010","I originally booked my flight to Miami from Washington, DC back in July 2017. I was scheduled to fly September 13-18, 2017. I, like many, had to cancel my trip because of hurricane Irma. I was informed by two customer service representatives that I would be able to rebook my flight to Miami with no additional charges in fare and no change fees. Of course, when it comes time to book my flight, I'm informed about a change fee. I told the agent, I was reassured twice that I would not be charged any additional fees because my initial cancellation was weather related. "
Donna of Shipman, VA," Sept. 22, 2010","American Airlines is full of **. Our cruise was cancelled due to Hurricane Irma. It was beyond our control and the airline stated there was nothing that they could do. No partial credit, changes or anything! I will not be flying with them anymore!"
Elizabeth of Sparta, NC," Sept. 19, 2010",My husband and I were scheduled to fly out at 7:15 am to go to California for a very important family matter. We do not live near the airport so we were up early to make sure we were early and nothing could go wrong. But things did go wrong. When we got to the airport we went and printed out tickets at the self checkout. We did notice that it mentioned no overhead storage for our carry on bags. So confused because we fly a lot and there is always overhead storage or they place in under the cabin. So we asked a lady that was standing in the area of self print and she looked and our tickets said we would be fine... Again we were told wrong.
Elaine of Murrysville, PA," Sept. 16, 2010","On September 4 my family of 5 arrived at the airport in Anchorage to fly home to Toronto via Dallas. Four of us had carry-on sized luggage but one had a mid-sized suitcase that we knew we would have to check. Our flight to Toronto included a 12.5-hour connection at DFW (not by choice). Since none of us sleep well on planes, we were considering going to a hotel following the overnight flight to DFW. When checking the suitcase, I specifically asked the American Airlines agent ""if we only check this bag to DFW and then go to a hotel for a few hours of sleep, will we be charged a second baggage fee to check the bag in for the flight to Toronto? If so we can rearrange the bags so that we can just check it through to Toronto."" "
William of Charlotte, NC," Sept. 15, 2010","I purchased the basic economy ticket. When I was getting ready to board in Charlotte, the attendant mentioned that this was a new program for your airline and that customers have stated it was cost effective. However, this was not my case! I paid nearly $600 to fly from Columbus, OH to Asheville, NC. Absolutely absurd!!! In the future, I will do all I can to avoid flying with your airline and don't count on a positive recommendation from me to others! Also, stop charging for the first piece of checked in luggage!"

September 11 I checked the flight online and it was canceled. I called customer service. Patricia told me that I was wrong it wasn't cancel. I called at night again because I was worried I saw it was still cancel. After almost 2 hours they answered the phone. I told them what happened. They told me that they were very sorry but the flight was canceled and they didnt' have flight for Sept 12. They gave me 1 stop flight for Sept 13. "
Alexandria of Tucson, AZ," Sept. 14, 2010","I was scheduled to fly out of Tampa International on Sunday, September, 17th to Durango, CO. I live in Sarasota, and just returned home the other day after evacuating for Hurricane Irma. I fled Florida and headed to Georgia, where I had to rent a hotel for a few nights. When I returned home I was fortunate enough not to have suffered damage. I of course have yard debris strewn about and I am still without power. The power company has estimated by the end of the day on September 22nd I will have power. With the extra costs incurred from having to leave my home, and the loss of power, I decided this was not a good time to travel."
Jack of Killeen, TX," Sept. 13, 2010","Hurricane Irma was mess for AA. I get it. I'm sure there were thousands who were stuck trying to get their flights changed. Unfortunately, I was in Costa Rica with a connection via Miami and I got, as the AA agent said ""the short end of the stick."" I would be stuck almost another week in Costa Rica as everything AA had was booked out or cancelled. I saw a little bit of silver lining when I found that if I could get to Mexico city, I could fly home via DFW. However, AA would not change the ticket as it is against their rules to change the country of origin on a ticket. ""We cannot do it."" However, a more accurate description is ""will not."""
Luis of Downey , CA," Sept. 13, 2010","We were delayed on our AA out of Seattle due to having to wait on flight crew. Managed to make it to Dallas on time BUT had to sit on the tarmac for 20 mins waiting for a gait in order to deplane. This caused to miss our connecting flight. Next available flight is the next day. Asked about compensation for overnight hotel stay (there are 7 in our party, including a 3 year old) and were denied due to the delay being coded as weather related, which is absolutely bogus. So livid, frustrated, and tired at this point. Also found out AA has no number to call for complaints... You have to go through email so who knows if they will even read it or reply. Will never fly AA again if I can help it."
Stacie of Greer, SC," Sept. 12, 2010","I was on an almost 2 hour flight (Flight AA3936) stuck sitting with one leg over my bag and the other on the edge of the aisle. Not once was I asked to check in my bag nor told it wouldn't fit on the overhead bin. By the time we landed my knees, hips and back were killing me and I had to have help from the gentleman next to me to be able to stand up. So glad there wasn't an emergency 'cause this would have been one hell of a hazard. Lesson learned not to use this airline again."
John of Media, PA," Sept. 10, 2010","American Airlines‰Û_the new standard for horrible service. Oh‰Û_I mean HORRIBLE! I travel very frequently for work and have stuck to one specific airline in order to build my status with them (ie. first class upgrades often, better seat choices, free checked bags). Recently, service has taken a turn for the worse. I‰Ûªm a reasonable guy and tolerate more than most. Call it my Southern hospitality, my upbringing or my service to the community when I served in law enforcement, but I just plain put up with more‰Û_until now."
Kerdie of Aurora, CO," Sept. 9, 2010","I travel 80%~ for Work and have flown with almost every airline multiple times. AA is by far the worst. Not due to their customer service/staff/delays or anything like that (at least that I‰Ûªve noticed), but their planes have no entertainment system on each seat, they do not play movies on the overhead screens, and they don‰Ûªt even have a free WiFi movie/tv option you can connect to using your phone! I‰Ûªm currently on a flight from Boston to Phoenix and was utterly shocked when I sat in my seat and noticed no form of entertainment for a cross-country flight. Delta and other airlines provide personal entertainment screens on each screen or a smartphone connect feature for 2+ hr flights, which in turn make the flights more enjoyable. Anyways, to avoid rambling on and on about the lack of technology on AA planes I‰Ûªll just say if you enjoyed traveling in the late 90s early 2000s, then AA is for you. If you want to travel in 2017 and beyond, find a different airline."
Meikeisha of Roselle, NJ," Sept. 7, 2010","I had a horrible experience today on my flight back to Miami. I have been an AAdvantage member for many years now and have always chosen to be loyal to American but after today's experience that may change. The onboarding process was fine and the flight was on time, which to be honest is rare but I was happy. When the snacks and beverage cart came the attendant did not smile, looked unhappy to take our beverage order, handed me and my husband 2 cookies, I then I told her, ""Can we just get pretzels?"" She said ""Then I need the cookies back."" I was honestly appalled."
Annie of Biloxi, MS," Sept. 2, 2010","Don't deserve single star. Also, I have a flight from Chicago to Minneapolis 5 hours from now. And they have seats available on the earlier flight but won't give you without charging $75. They are ok to make you wait or fly a flight with empty seats but no customer delight which is no cost to them. No customer driven company and not looking for going extra mile to make customer happy. Never travel on American Airlines again."
Martha of Port St. Lucie, FL," Sept. 1, 2010","Worst experience ever with AA never again, they treated my dad like garbage, they humiliated my dad in front of my niece travelling with him and in front of all passengers, just because my dad is ** and not fluent in English. I wish I could sue them for discrimination against my dad for not speaking English fluent instead of offering assistance in Spanish which, the sky harbor airport in Arizona has plenty of bilingual employees. DO NOT FLY AA EVER, pay more with a different airline. The only reason why my dad and niece flew AA to go to my brother's funeral, thank you AA for the worst day ever. It's a shame I have to put a star instead of no stars service."
Lauritha of Laurel, MD," Sept. 1, 2010","This American Airlines review is out of frustration due to a lot of things. They're a disgrace! The employees are rude, there is no leg room, no entertainment, and treat people like herds of sheep. They have a ""New"" rule where they charge $50 at the gate to carry on your luggage. Are you kidding me? $50 for a carry on? And I can't even use the overhead bin! Disgraceful! Basically these guys are crooks! They're a disgrace. Last time I flew with American their flight was delayed by 2 hours and we ended up missing our connecting flight because it was the last flight out. We ended up having to stay an extra day and had to pay $100 for a hotel. We missed my sisters wedding. On the way back we ended up stuck on the tarmac for 2 hours. Of course!"
Denise of Lake Forest, CA," Aug. 31, 2010","I booked a ticket back when the hurricane were hitting down south every other week. Because of that I was not able to attend my trip in GA. They told me I had up to a year to use my ticket. So when I try to rebook my ticket they are now close to $500. Mind you this is the highest rate out of all the airlines for my particular dates, I asked for a refund because I didn't wanna double what I paid the first time and I was told by the Supervisor (Willie ** in Dallas ) that my only option was to ""use it or lost it"". Being a supervisor myself I thought the tone in which he said it was very careless and he didn't try to help the situation at all. I would never talk to my customers the way he spoke to me especially after losing out on $300!!"
Alice of Chicago, IL," Aug. 31, 2010","I just completed a flight on American Airlines. I had read negative reviews, but I found the American Airlines people I had contact with were great, tried to provide all the service they could because our flight had been cancelled due WX and had to layover at ORD. My complaint is the phoney coupon given for a hotel room for a ""discounted rate"". The coupon has nothing to do with American Airlines, but is only a hotel booking service. When I called the phone number provided I was told the only available room was 10 miles away and given a rate of $80.00. It was getting late in the evening so took it. Then was advised there was a $15 service charge to book the room. American Airline paid none of this. The shuttle bus to the hotel was packed (Other delayed passengers). When I got home I checked the hotel rate and found the same room went for $105. I ""saved"" $10. The hotel was a Holiday Inn Express. Room not bad."
George of Rancho Santa Margarita, CA," Aug. 29, 2010","I was en route from San Antonio Texas to Hong Kong and when checking in for the domestic portion of the flight at the ticket counter, the woman claimed there was a problem with my passport. I asked for details and she claimed ""There are spots on your passport."" I told her the passport was still valid and did not expire until the following year."" She made up some baloney about Homeland Security not letting people fly with spots on their passport. I told her I checked their website and there was no mention of anything like that. She then claimed, ""Oh, they don't tell you."" I said, ""Then how are you supposed to know?"" She then sarcastically claimed I needed glasses, so I put my glasses on and told her those so called spots are not a problem. "
Karen of North Kingstown, RI," Aug. 26, 2010","On 10/21/17 Gate L8 Karen.

Tom of Phoenix, AZ," Aug. 23, 2010","Where do I even begin? I had a round trip flight booked from Toronto, Ontario to Busan, South Korea back in the month of July (2017). While I was away, I heard the news that my dad had passed away. In which, I contacted American Airlines right away and asked if anything can be done. I wanted to fly back before my actual trip date, due to obvious reasons. I even offered to provide them with a death certificate if need be (although, I don't think that is even something they should ask for right away). I spoke to 3 different customer service reps who were all horrible to speak with. They had zero compassion and empathy and just dismissed me as if what I was experiencing was far from a big deal to them. "
Jack of Stony Brook, NY," Aug. 23, 2010","I was on the plane for 14 hours due to a delay. Sitting in a broken seat that would not recline. I told the stewardess and she could care less, said nothing she can do. After I got home I contacted the airline and they issued me a fourteen dollar credit. I had paid 197.34 dollars for preferred seats. The worst flight of my life, never again w/ this airline."
Hicham of Casablanca, Other," Aug. 22, 2010","Overall, (Un)American Airlines continues to disappoint. I really only ever fly with AA as a last resort, and I can't see any reason to recommend traveling with AA. I was prior active duty Army, and now I'm a reservist, and only American Airlines makes me feel like my service is less important now. United, Southwest, Jet Blue, Delta, every other airline doesn't discriminate between Active Duty and Reserve/Guardsmen when it comes to bag fees. So, along with uncomfortable, outdated planes and poor service, I spent a $100 checking bags to and from my destination."
Spc of Mcchord afb, ," Aug. 20, 2010",American Airlines is the worst airlines to fly anywhere. They cram you in the seats with no leg room or any room for that matter. I requested a wheelchair at airport and waited 30 minutes upon someone finally arriving. They took me the wrong way to my next check in and I missed my flight. They said I would have to rebook my ticket and just wait for the next flight. Attendant at the gate was very disrespectful and not helpful at all. I had no control over this situation at all. Not to mention when I did finally arrive at my destination that I requested a wheelchair prior to my departure.
Calvin of Honolulu, HI," Aug. 13, 2010","American Airlines is the worst airline in THE WORLD, and should change their name, it is utterly disgraceful that as an American they use this name. Their policy is to not apologize for anything, to be as rude as possible to people who are basically held hostage to them and their BS policies like closing the door to the gate while people are standing there then charging them money to rebook their flight, not caring at all about the bags on their way to a destination without the owners there to pick them up. Then being told when lodging a complaint that it was going in one ear and out the other. I have never been treated so poorly in my life, I will never again fly with this airline, I hope they go bankrupt and get the worst karma life can give. Oh yeah and I get to fly with them tomorrow. :/"
David of Marlton, NJ," Aug. 11, 2010","Very disappointed. Unlikely I will ever choose American Airlines again. I didn't make my flight in the spring. I was given a voucher to use for future travel. Now I'm being told I can only use it myself, and not for my family. I don't want to use it for myself. What difference does it make? I'm being told different things by different people. The last guy hung up on me and I wasn't even rude to him. This is how AA does business? All I want is to not be penalized for cancelling a flight that was beyond my control. If you have a voucher it should be flexible to use for anyone. AA is the WORST! Hope they go out of business for this nonsense. Airline travel is a joke."
Jessica of Monroe, CT," Aug. 11, 2010","American Airlines canceled my 92-year-old father-in-law's flight to Key West due to Hurricane Irma. On that day American Airline was contacted and the representative said there would be no problem re-booking, just use the reference number. American Airlines even went on TV and said they would waive re-booking fees. Today when calling to re-book the flight and after 57 minutes on the phone, I was told the flight could not be re-booked because it was in their notes I requested a refund. At no time did I request a refund and American Airlines could not locate any record of a refund request. Even so, American Airlines still insisted they could not re-book the flight or issue a refund. If we did not have enough trouble dealing with a Cat 4 hurricane and its devastating aftermath, now American Airlines is adding to the misery. All my father-in-law wants is to come to Key West and see that everyone is alright. Thanks, AA."

The employees are rude, there is no leg room, no entertainment, and treat people like herds of sheep. They have a ""New"" rule where they charge $50 at the gate to carry on your luggage. Are you kidding me? $50 for a carry on? And I can't even use the overhead bin! Disgraceful! Basically these guys are crooks! They're a disgrace. Last time I flew with American their flight was delayed by 2 hours and we ended up missing our connecting flight because it was the last flight out. We ended up having to stay an extra day and had to pay $100 for a hotel. We missed my sisters wedding. On the way back we ended up stuck on the tarmac for 2 hours. Of course!"
Blair of Bethlehem, PA," July 16, 2010","I booked a ticket back when the hurricane were hitting down south every other week. Because of that I was not able to attend my trip in GA. They told me I had up to a year to use my ticket. So when I try to rebook my ticket they are now close to $500. Mind you this is the highest rate out of all the airlines for my particular dates, I asked for a refund because I didn't wanna double what I paid the first time and I was told by the Supervisor (Willie ** in Dallas ) that my only option was to ""use it or lost it"". Being a supervisor myself I thought the tone in which he said it was very careless and he didn't try to help the situation at all. I would never talk to my customers the way he spoke to me especially after losing out on $300!!"
Beverly of Mattapan, MA," July 16, 2010","I just completed a flight on American Airlines. I had read negative reviews, but I found the American Airlines people I had contact with were great, tried to provide all the service they could because our flight had been cancelled due WX and had to layover at ORD. My complaint is the phoney coupon given for a hotel room for a ""discounted rate"". The coupon has nothing to do with American Airlines, but is only a hotel booking service. When I called the phone number provided I was told the only available room was 10 miles away and given a rate of $80.00. It was getting late in the evening so took it. Then was advised there was a $15 service charge to book the room. American Airline paid none of this. The shuttle bus to the hotel was packed (Other delayed passengers). When I got home I checked the hotel rate and found the same room went for $105. I ""saved"" $10. The hotel was a Holiday Inn Express. Room not bad."
Ida of New Iberia, LA," July 15, 2010","I was en route from San Antonio Texas to Hong Kong and when checking in for the domestic portion of the flight at the ticket counter, the woman claimed there was a problem with my passport.

She made up some baloney about Homeland Security not letting people fly with spots on their passport. I told her I checked their website and there was no mention of anything like that. She then claimed, ""Oh, they don't tell you."" I said, ""Then how are you supposed to know?"" She then sarcastically claimed I needed glasses, so I put my glasses on and told her those so called spots are not a problem. "

While I was away, I heard the news that my dad had passed away. In which, I contacted American Airlines right away and asked if anything can be done. I wanted to fly back before my actual trip date, due to obvious reasons. I even offered to provide them with a death certificate if need be (although, I don't think that is even something they should ask for right away). I spoke to 3 different customer service reps who were all horrible to speak with. They had zero compassion and empathy and just dismissed me as if what I was experiencing was far from a big deal to them. "
G.F. of Tucson, AZ," July 8, 2010","I was on the plane for 14 hours due to a delay. Sitting in a broken seat that would not recline. I told the stewardess and she could care less, said nothing she can do. After I got home I contacted the airline and they issued me a fourteen dollar credit. I had paid 197.34 dollars for preferred seats. The worst flight of my life, never again w/ this airline."
Nancy of Rolla, MO," July 7, 2010","Overall, (Un)American Airlines continues to disappoint. I really only ever fly with AA as a last resort, and I can't see any reason to recommend traveling with AA. I was prior active duty Army, and now I'm a reservist, and only American Airlines makes me feel like my service is less important now. United, Southwest, Jet Blue, Delta, every other airline doesn't discriminate between Active Duty and Reserve/Guardsmen when it comes to bag fees. So, along with uncomfortable, outdated planes and poor service, I spent a $100 checking bags to and from my destination."
Esau of Aventura, fl," July 4, 2010",American Airlines is the worst airlines to fly anywhere. They cram you in the seats with no leg room or any room for that matter. I requested a wheelchair at airport and waited 30 minutes upon someone finally arriving. They took me the wrong way to my next check in and I missed my flight. They said I would have to rebook my ticket and just wait for the next flight. Attendant at the gate was very disrespectful and not helpful at all. I had no control over this situation at all. Not to mention when I did finally arrive at my destination that I requested a wheelchair prior to my departure.
Alvaro of Walnut, CA," July 4, 2010","American Airlines is the worst airline in THE WORLD, and should change their name, it is utterly disgraceful that as an American they use this name. Their policy is to not apologize for anything, to be as rude as possible to people who are basically held hostage to them and their BS policies like closing the door to the gate while people are standing there then charging them money to rebook their flight, not caring at all about the bags on their way to a destination without the owners there to pick them up. Then being told when lodging a complaint that it was going in one ear and out the other. I have never been treated so poorly in my life, I will never again fly with this airline, I hope they go bankrupt and get the worst karma life can give. Oh yeah and I get to fly with them tomorrow. :/"
Chih-huang of White Plains, NY," June 29, 2010","Very disappointed. Unlikely I will ever choose American Airlines again. I didn't make my flight in the spring. I was given a voucher to use for future travel. Now I'm being told I can only use it myself, and not for my family. I don't want to use it for myself. What difference does it make? I'm being told different things by different people. The last guy hung up on me and I wasn't even rude to him. This is how AA does business? All I want is to not be penalized for cancelling a flight that was beyond my control. If you have a voucher it should be flexible to use for anyone. AA is the WORST! Hope they go out of business for this nonsense. Airline travel is a joke."
Jill of Kemah, TX," June 28, 2010","American Airlines canceled my 92-year-old father-in-law's flight to Key West due to Hurricane Irma. On that day American Airline was contacted and the representative said there would be no problem re-booking, just use the reference number. American Airlines even went on TV and said they would waive re-booking fees. Today when calling to re-book the flight and after 57 minutes on the phone, I was told the flight could not be re-booked because it was in their notes I requested a refund. At no time did I request a refund and American Airlines could not locate any record of a refund request. Even so, American Airlines still insisted they could not re-book the flight or issue a refund. If we did not have enough trouble dealing with a Cat 4 hurricane and its devastating aftermath, now American Airlines is adding to the misery. All my father-in-law wants is to come to Key West and see that everyone is alright. Thanks, AA."
Charlotte of Danvers, MA," June 27, 2010",I bought tickets for my mother in law and son to meet my wife and I in Colorado. We had traveled on different airlines due to connections and therefore were going back on different airlines. My wife and I left on our airplane. My mother in law and son were stranded as the plane had a mechanical. This was 8 AM and the bottom line was it didn't get fixed that day. American gave them a 12.00 voucher good in the terminal and did nothing to get them a room as the rooms they usually used weren't available.
Shana of Emeryville, CA," June 26, 2010","I booked 2 separate flights on American Airlines in Economy since I pay for my air travel. On one they pre-assigned me a back-of-plane middle seat and said that I was required to pay some increased fee for window, aisle or closer to the front. On the second flight they said I have to wait until I reach the boarding gate for any seat. This is ridiculous and unacceptable. The airline has sufficient revenue to - just a suggestion - increase the ""base"" fare to cover a first-come-first-served seat selection and not put everyone into 3rd class or worse status. If they want to surcharge certain premium seats, like middle seats toward the front, that's OK, but this behavior is totally unacceptable and I refuse to fly them (or any airline) that abuses their passengers."
Juana of Mesquite, TX," June 25, 2010",Well I looked into changing my flight for my fiance and I to go home a day earlier... only to discover that American charges $200.00 a ticket PLUS the difference in price tickets! LIKE THAT IS GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE! So for the price of another ticket I can change my flight! I will be looking elsewhere for flights in the future. I have already paid for a flight and now you are trying to rip me off even more!?! Out of touch and terrible service to a customer of over 5 years. I will be going elsewhere where I don't get bent over the table. Thank you American!
Valerie of Westminster, co," June 23, 2010","I originally booked my flight to Miami from Washington, DC back in July 2017. I was scheduled to fly September 13-18, 2017.

I was informed by two customer service representatives that I would be able to rebook my flight to Miami with no additional charges in fare and no change fees. Of course, when it comes time to book my flight, I'm informed about a change fee. I told the agent, I was reassured twice that I would not be charged any additional fees because my initial cancellation was weather related. "
Kevan of Cear Hill, TX," June 17, 2010","American Airlines is full of **. Our cruise was cancelled due to Hurricane Irma. It was beyond our control and the airline stated there was nothing that they could do. No partial credit, changes or anything! I will not be flying with them anymore!"
Colin of York, PA," June 17, 2010",My husband and I were scheduled to fly out at 7:15 am to go to California for a very important family matter. We do not live near the airport so we were up early to make sure we were early and nothing could go wrong. But things did go wrong. When we got to the airport we went and printed out tickets at the self checkout. We did notice that it mentioned no overhead storage for our carry on bags. So confused because we fly a lot and there is always overhead storage or they place in under the cabin. So we asked a lady that was standing in the area of self print and she looked and our tickets said we would be fine... Again we were told wrong.
Stacie of Kirtland , NM," June 16, 2010","On September 4 my family of 5 arrived at the airport in Anchorage to fly home to Toronto via Dallas. Four of us had carry-on sized luggage but one had a mid-sized suitcase that we knew we would have to check. Our flight to Toronto included a 12.5-hour connection at DFW (not by choice). Since none of us sleep well on planes, we were considering going to a hotel following the overnight flight to DFW. When checking the suitcase, I specifically asked the American Airlines agent ""if we only check this bag to DFW and then go to a hotel for a few hours of sleep, will we be charged a second baggage fee to check the bag in for the flight to Toronto? If so we can rearrange the bags so that we can just check it through to Toronto."" "
Shanti of Chicago, IL," June 15, 2010","I purchased the basic economy ticket. When I was getting ready to board in Charlotte, the attendant mentioned that this was a new program for your airline and that customers have stated it was cost effective. However, this was not my case! I paid nearly $600 to fly from Columbus, OH to Asheville, NC. Absolutely absurd!!! In the future, I will do all I can to avoid flying with your airline and don't count on a positive recommendation from me to others! Also, stop charging for the first piece of checked in luggage!"

I called at night again because I was worried I saw it was still cancel. After almost 2 hours they answered the phone. I told them what happened. They told me that they were very sorry but the flight was canceled and they didnt' have flight for Sept 12. They gave me 1 stop flight for Sept 13. "
Father of Aliquippa, PA," June 13, 2010","I was scheduled to fly out of Tampa International on Sunday, September, 17th to Durango, CO. I live in Sarasota, and just returned home the other day after evacuating for Hurricane Irma. I fled Florida and headed to Georgia, where I had to rent a hotel for a few nights. When I returned home I was fortunate enough not to have suffered damage. I of course have yard debris strewn about and I am still without power. The power company has estimated by the end of the day on September 22nd I will have power. With the extra costs incurred from having to leave my home, and the loss of power, I decided this was not a good time to travel."
Joan of Highland park, nj," June 5, 2010","Hurricane Irma was mess for AA. I get it. I'm sure there were thousands who were stuck trying to get their flights changed. Unfortunately, I was in Costa Rica with a connection via Miami and I got, as the AA agent said ""the short end of the stick."" I would be stuck almost another week in Costa Rica as everything AA had was booked out or cancelled. I saw a little bit of silver lining when I found that if I could get to Mexico city, I could fly home via DFW. However, AA would not change the ticket as it is against their rules to change the country of origin on a ticket. ""We cannot do it."" However, a more accurate description is ""will not."""
Eva of Princeton, NJ," June 4, 2010","We were delayed on our AA out of Seattle due to having to wait on flight crew. Managed to make it to Dallas on time BUT had to sit on the tarmac for 20 mins waiting for a gait in order to deplane. This caused to miss our connecting flight. Next available flight is the next day. Asked about compensation for overnight hotel stay (there are 7 in our party, including a 3 year old) and were denied due to the delay being coded as weather related, which is absolutely bogus. So livid, frustrated, and tired at this point. Also found out AA has no number to call for complaints... You have to go through email so who knows if they will even read it or reply. Will never fly AA again if I can help it."
Sam of Palm City, FL," June 2, 2010","I was on an almost 2 hour flight (Flight AA3936) stuck sitting with one leg over my bag and the other on the edge of the aisle. Not once was I asked to check in my bag nor told it wouldn't fit on the overhead bin. By the time we landed my knees, hips and back were killing me and I had to have help from the gentleman next to me to be able to stand up. So glad there wasn't an emergency 'cause this would have been one hell of a hazard. Lesson learned not to use this airline again."
Luetilla of Huntsville, AL," May 26, 2010","American Airlines‰Û_the new standard for horrible service. Oh‰Û_I mean HORRIBLE! I travel very frequently for work and have stuck to one specific airline in order to build my status with them (ie. first class upgrades often, better seat choices, free checked bags). Recently, service has taken a turn for the worse. I‰Ûªm a reasonable guy and tolerate more than most. Call it my Southern hospitality, my upbringing or my service to the community when I served in law enforcement, but I just plain put up with more‰Û_until now."
Myra of Kingsport, TN," May 26, 2010","I travel 80%~ for Work and have flown with almost every airline multiple times. AA is by far the worst. Not due to their customer service/staff/delays or anything like that (at least that I‰Ûªve noticed), but their planes have no entertainment system on each seat, they do not play movies on the overhead screens, and they don‰Ûªt even have a free WiFi movie/tv option you can connect to using your phone! I‰Ûªm currently on a flight from Boston to Phoenix and was utterly shocked when I sat in my seat and noticed no form of entertainment for a cross-country flight. Delta and other airlines provide personal entertainment screens on each screen or a smartphone connect feature for 2+ hr flights, which in turn make the flights more enjoyable. Anyways, to avoid rambling on and on about the lack of technology on AA planes I‰Ûªll just say if you enjoyed traveling in the late 90s early 2000s, then AA is for you. If you want to travel in 2017 and beyond, find a different airline."
Donna of Manchester Center, VT," May 25, 2010","I had a horrible experience today on my flight back to Miami. I have been an AAdvantage member for many years now and have always chosen to be loyal to American but after today's experience that may change. The onboarding process was fine and the flight was on time, which to be honest is rare but I was happy. When the snacks and beverage cart came the attendant did not smile, looked unhappy to take our beverage order, handed me and my husband 2 cookies, I then I told her, ""Can we just get pretzels?"" She said ""Then I need the cookies back."" I was honestly appalled."
Philathia of Savannah, GA," May 22, 2010","Don't deserve single star. Also, I have a flight from Chicago to Minneapolis 5 hours from now. And they have seats available on the earlier flight but won't give you without charging $75. They are ok to make you wait or fly a flight with empty seats but no customer delight which is no cost to them. No customer driven company and not looking for going extra mile to make customer happy. Never travel on American Airlines again."
James of N. Dartmouth, MA," May 20, 2010","Worst experience ever with AA never again, they treated my dad like garbage, they humiliated my dad in front of my niece travelling with him and in front of all passengers, just because my dad is ** and not fluent in English. I wish I could sue them for discrimination against my dad for not speaking English fluent instead of offering assistance in Spanish which, the sky harbor airport in Arizona has plenty of bilingual employees. DO NOT FLY AA EVER, pay more with a different airline. The only reason why my dad and niece flew AA to go to my brother's funeral, thank you AA for the worst day ever.

Sue of Ewing, NJ," March 24, 2010","On September 4 my family of 5 arrived at the airport in Anchorage to fly home to Toronto via Dallas. Four of us had carry-on sized luggage but one had a mid-sized suitcase that we knew we would have to check. Our flight to Toronto included a 12.5-hour connection at DFW (not by choice). Since none of us sleep well on planes, we were considering going to a hotel following the overnight flight to DFW. When checking the suitcase, I specifically asked the American Airlines agent ""if we only check this bag to DFW and then go to a hotel for a few hours of sleep, will we be charged a second baggage fee to check the bag in for the flight to Toronto? If so we can rearrange the bags so that we can just check it through to Toronto."" "
Jenell of Columbus, OH," March 23, 2010","I purchased the basic economy ticket. When I was getting ready to board in Charlotte, the attendant mentioned that this was a new program for your airline and that customers have stated it was cost effective. However, this was not my case! I paid nearly $600 to fly from Columbus, OH to Asheville, NC. Absolutely absurd!!! In the future, I will do all I can to avoid flying with your airline and don't count on a positive recommendation from me to others! Also, stop charging for the first piece of checked in luggage!"

I called at night again because I was worried I saw it was still cancel. After almost 2 hours they answered the phone. I told them what happened. They told me that they were very sorry but the flight was canceled and they didnt' have flight for Sept 12. They gave me 1 stop flight for Sept 13. "
Robert of Tucson, AZ," March 22, 2010","I was scheduled to fly out of Tampa International on Sunday, September, 17th to Durango, CO. I live in Sarasota, and just returned home the other day after evacuating for Hurricane Irma. I fled Florida and headed to Georgia, where I had to rent a hotel for a few nights. When I returned home I was fortunate enough not to have suffered damage. I of course have yard debris strewn about and I am still without power. The power company has estimated by the end of the day on September 22nd I will have power. With the extra costs incurred from having to leave my home, and the loss of power, I decided this was not a good time to travel."
Marion of Paterson, NJ," March 19, 2010","Hurricane Irma was mess for AA. I get it. I'm sure there were thousands who were stuck trying to get their flights changed. Unfortunately, I was in Costa Rica with a connection via Miami and I got, as the AA agent said ""the short end of the stick."" I would be stuck almost another week in Costa Rica as everything AA had was booked out or cancelled. I saw a little bit of silver lining when I found that if I could get to Mexico city, I could fly home via DFW. However, AA would not change the ticket as it is against their rules to change the country of origin on a ticket. ""We cannot do it."" However, a more accurate description is ""will not."""
Barbara of West Bend, WI," March 17, 2010","We were delayed on our AA out of Seattle due to having to wait on flight crew. Managed to make it to Dallas on time BUT had to sit on the tarmac for 20 mins waiting for a gait in order to deplane. This caused to miss our connecting flight. Next available flight is the next day. Asked about compensation for overnight hotel stay (there are 7 in our party, including a 3 year old) and were denied due to the delay being coded as weather related, which is absolutely bogus. So livid, frustrated, and tired at this point. Also found out AA has no number to call for complaints... You have to go through email so who knows if they will even read it or reply. Will never fly AA again if I can help it."
Penny of Rio, WI," March 17, 2010","I was on an almost 2 hour flight (Flight AA3936) stuck sitting with one leg over my bag and the other on the edge of the aisle. Not once was I asked to check in my bag nor told it wouldn't fit on the overhead bin. By the time we landed my knees, hips and back were killing me and I had to have help from the gentleman next to me to be able to stand up. So glad there wasn't an emergency 'cause this would have been one hell of a hazard. Lesson learned not to use this airline again."
Benniamin of Long Beach, CA," March 16, 2010","American Airlines‰Û_the new standard for horrible service. Oh‰Û_I mean HORRIBLE! I travel very frequently for work and have stuck to one specific airline in order to build my status with them (ie. first class upgrades often, better seat choices, free checked bags). Recently, service has taken a turn for the worse. I‰Ûªm a reasonable guy and tolerate more than most. Call it my Southern hospitality, my upbringing or my service to the community when I served in law enforcement, but I just plain put up with more‰Û_until now."
Julie of Gainesville, GA," March 15, 2010","I travel 80%~ for Work and have flown with almost every airline multiple times. AA is by far the worst. Not due to their customer service/staff/delays or anything like that (at least that I‰Ûªve noticed), but their planes have no entertainment system on each seat, they do not play movies on the overhead screens, and they don‰Ûªt even have a free WiFi movie/tv option you can connect to using your phone! I‰Ûªm currently on a flight from Boston to Phoenix and was utterly shocked when I sat in my seat and noticed no form of entertainment for a cross-country flight. Delta and other airlines provide personal entertainment screens on each screen or a smartphone connect feature for 2+ hr flights, which in turn make the flights more enjoyable. Anyways, to avoid rambling on and on about the lack of technology on AA planes I‰Ûªll just say if you enjoyed traveling in the late 90s early 2000s, then AA is for you. If you want to travel in 2017 and beyond, find a different airline."
Joan of Marlton, NJ," March 14, 2010","I had a horrible experience today on my flight back to Miami. I have been an AAdvantage member for many years now and have always chosen to be loyal to American but after today's experience that may change. The onboarding process was fine and the flight was on time, which to be honest is rare but I was happy. When the snacks and beverage cart came the attendant did not smile, looked unhappy to take our beverage order, handed me and my husband 2 cookies, I then I told her, ""Can we just get pretzels?"" She said ""Then I need the cookies back."" I was honestly appalled."
Anthony of Miami Springs, FL," March 13, 2010","Don't deserve single star. Also, I have a flight from Chicago to Minneapolis 5 hours from now. And they have seats available on the earlier flight but won't give you without charging $75. They are ok to make you wait or fly a flight with empty seats but no customer delight which is no cost to them. No customer driven company and not looking for going extra mile to make customer happy. Never travel on American Airlines again."
Nancy of Brooklyn, NY," March 13, 2010","Worst experience ever with AA never again, they treated my dad like garbage, they humiliated my dad in front of my niece travelling with him and in front of all passengers, just because my dad is ** and not fluent in English. I wish I could sue them for discrimination against my dad for not speaking English fluent instead of offering assistance in Spanish which, the sky harbor airport in Arizona has plenty of bilingual employees. DO NOT FLY AA EVER, pay more with a different airline. The only reason why my dad and niece flew AA to go to my brother's funeral, thank you AA for the worst day ever. It's a shame I have to put a star instead of no stars service."
Kermit of Menomonie, WI," March 11, 2010","This American Airlines review is out of frustration due to a lot of things. They're a disgrace! The employees are rude, there is no leg room, no entertainment, and treat people like herds of sheep. They have a ""New"" rule where they charge $50 at the gate to carry on your luggage. Are you kidding me? $50 for a carry on? And I can't even use the overhead bin! Disgraceful! Basically these guys are crooks! They're a disgrace. Last time I flew with American their flight was delayed by 2 hours and we ended up missing our connecting flight because it was the last flight out. We ended up having to stay an extra day and had to pay $100 for a hotel. We missed my sisters wedding. On the way back we ended up stuck on the tarmac for 2 hours. Of course!"
Kimberly of Matthews, NC," March 8, 2010","I booked a ticket back when the hurricane were hitting down south every other week. Because of that I was not able to attend my trip in GA. They told me I had up to a year to use my ticket. So when I try to rebook my ticket they are now close to $500. Mind you this is the highest rate out of all the airlines for my particular dates, I asked for a refund because I didn't wanna double what I paid the first time and I was told by the Supervisor (Willie ** in Dallas ) that my only option was to ""use it or lost it"". Being a supervisor myself I thought the tone in which he said it was very careless and he didn't try to help the situation at all. I would never talk to my customers the way he spoke to me especially after losing out on $300!!"
Roger of Prairie du Chien, WI," March 7, 2010","I just completed a flight on American Airlines. I had read negative reviews, but I found the American Airlines people I had contact with were great, tried to provide all the service they could because our flight had been cancelled due WX and had to layover at ORD. My complaint is the phoney coupon given for a hotel room for a ""discounted rate"". The coupon has nothing to do with American Airlines, but is only a hotel booking service. When I called the phone number provided I was told the only available room was 10 miles away and given a rate of $80.00. It was getting late in the evening so took it. Then was advised there was a $15 service charge to book the room. American Airline paid none of this. The shuttle bus to the hotel was packed (Other delayed passengers). When I got home I checked the hotel rate and found the same room went for $105. I ""saved"" $10. The hotel was a Holiday Inn Express. Room not bad."

She made up some baloney about Homeland Security not letting people fly with spots on their passport. I told her I checked their website and there was no mention of anything like that.

Albert of Haddam, CT," March 3, 2010","Where do I even begin? I had a round trip flight booked from Toronto, Ontario to Busan, South Korea back in the month of July (2017). While I was away, I heard the news that my dad had passed away. In which, I contacted American Airlines right away and asked if anything can be done. I wanted to fly back before my actual trip date, due to obvious reasons. I even offered to provide them with a death certificate if need be (although, I don't think that is even something they should ask for right away). I spoke to 3 different customer service reps who were all horrible to speak with. They had zero compassion and empathy and just dismissed me as if what I was experiencing was far from a big deal to them. "
Mary of Garden City, NY," Feb. 27, 2010","I was on the plane for 14 hours due to a delay. Sitting in a broken seat that would not recline. I told the stewardess and she could care less, said nothing she can do. After I got home I contacted the airline and they issued me a fourteen dollar credit. I had paid 197.34 dollars for preferred seats. The worst flight of my life, never again w/ this airline."
Gail of Skokie, IL," Feb. 24, 2010","Overall, (Un)American Airlines continues to disappoint. I really only ever fly with AA as a last resort, and I can't see any reason to recommend traveling with AA. I was prior active duty Army, and now I'm a reservist, and only American Airlines makes me feel like my service is less important now. United, Southwest, Jet Blue, Delta, every other airline doesn't discriminate between Active Duty and Reserve/Guardsmen when it comes to bag fees. So, along with uncomfortable, outdated planes and poor service, I spent a $100 checking bags to and from my destination."
Andrea of Brooklyn, NY," Feb. 23, 2010",American Airlines is the worst airlines to fly anywhere. They cram you in the seats with no leg room or any room for that matter. I requested a wheelchair at airport and waited 30 minutes upon someone finally arriving. They took me the wrong way to my next check in and I missed my flight. They said I would have to rebook my ticket and just wait for the next flight. Attendant at the gate was very disrespectful and not helpful at all. I had no control over this situation at all. Not to mention when I did finally arrive at my destination that I requested a wheelchair prior to my departure.
Amy of Plainfield, IN," Feb. 22, 2010","American Airlines is the worst airline in THE WORLD, and should change their name, it is utterly disgraceful that as an American they use this name. Their policy is to not apologize for anything, to be as rude as possible to people who are basically held hostage to them and their BS policies like closing the door to the gate while people are standing there then charging them money to rebook their flight, not caring at all about the bags on their way to a destination without the owners there to pick them up. Then being told when lodging a complaint that it was going in one ear and out the other. I have never been treated so poorly in my life, I will never again fly with this airline, I hope they go bankrupt and get the worst karma life can give. Oh yeah and I get to fly with them tomorrow. :/"
Dodie of Juneau, AK," Feb. 22, 2010","Very disappointed. Unlikely I will ever choose American Airlines again. I didn't make my flight in the spring. I was given a voucher to use for future travel. Now I'm being told I can only use it myself, and not for my family. I don't want to use it for myself. What difference does it make? I'm being told different things by different people. The last guy hung up on me and I wasn't even rude to him. This is how AA does business? All I want is to not be penalized for cancelling a flight that was beyond my control. If you have a voucher it should be flexible to use for anyone. AA is the WORST! Hope they go out of business for this nonsense. Airline travel is a joke."
Susan of Keaau, HI," Feb. 21, 2010","American Airlines canceled my 92-year-old father-in-law's flight to Key West due to Hurricane Irma. On that day American Airline was contacted and the representative said there would be no problem re-booking, just use the reference number. American Airlines even went on TV and said they would waive re-booking fees. Today when calling to re-book the flight and after 57 minutes on the phone, I was told the flight could not be re-booked because it was in their notes I requested a refund. At no time did I request a refund and American Airlines could not locate any record of a refund request. Even so, American Airlines still insisted they could not re-book the flight or issue a refund. If we did not have enough trouble dealing with a Cat 4 hurricane and its devastating aftermath, now American Airlines is adding to the misery. All my father-in-law wants is to come to Key West and see that everyone is alright. Thanks, AA."
John of Richmond Hill, ON," Feb. 18, 2010",I bought tickets for my mother in law and son to meet my wife and I in Colorado. We had traveled on different airlines due to connections and therefore were going back on different airlines. My wife and I left on our airplane. My mother in law and son were stranded as the plane had a mechanical. This was 8 AM and the bottom line was it didn't get fixed that day. American gave them a 12.00 voucher good in the terminal and did nothing to get them a room as the rooms they usually used weren't available.
Laura of Murrieta, ca," Feb. 18, 2010","I booked 2 separate flights on American Airlines in Economy since I pay for my air travel. On one they pre-assigned me a back-of-plane middle seat and said that I was required to pay some increased fee for window, aisle or closer to the front. On the second flight they said I have to wait until I reach the boarding gate for any seat. This is ridiculous and unacceptable. The airline has sufficient revenue to - just a suggestion - increase the ""base"" fare to cover a first-come-first-served seat selection and not put everyone into 3rd class or worse status. If they want to surcharge certain premium seats, like middle seats toward the front, that's OK, but this behavior is totally unacceptable and I refuse to fly them (or any airline) that abuses their passengers."
Heather of Clayton, NC," Feb. 16, 2010",Well I looked into changing my flight for my fiance and I to go home a day earlier... only to discover that American charges $200.00 a ticket PLUS the difference in price tickets!

I have already paid for a flight and now you are trying to rip me off even more!?! Out of touch and terrible service to a customer of over 5 years. I will be going elsewhere where I don't get bent over the table. Thank you American!

Jennifer of Elkridge, MD," Dec. 28, 2009","Where do I even begin? I had a round trip flight booked from Toronto, Ontario to Busan, South Korea back in the month of July (2017). While I was away, I heard the news that my dad had passed away. In which, I contacted American Airlines right away and asked if anything can be done. I wanted to fly back before my actual trip date, due to obvious reasons. I even offered to provide them with a death certificate if need be (although, I don't think that is even something they should ask for right away). I spoke to 3 different customer service reps who were all horrible to speak with. They had zero compassion and empathy and just dismissed me as if what I was experiencing was far from a big deal to them. "
Dee of Omaha, NE," Dec. 28, 2009","I was on the plane for 14 hours due to a delay. Sitting in a broken seat that would not recline. I told the stewardess and she could care less, said nothing she can do. After I got home I contacted the airline and they issued me a fourteen dollar credit. I had paid 197.34 dollars for preferred seats. The worst flight of my life, never again w/ this airline."
George of Denver, CO," Dec. 24, 2009","Overall, (Un)American Airlines continues to disappoint. I really only ever fly with AA as a last resort, and I can't see any reason to recommend traveling with AA. I was prior active duty Army, and now I'm a reservist, and only American Airlines makes me feel like my service is less important now. United, Southwest, Jet Blue, Delta, every other airline doesn't discriminate between Active Duty and Reserve/Guardsmen when it comes to bag fees. So, along with uncomfortable, outdated planes and poor service, I spent a $100 checking bags to and from my destination."
Aline of Kearney, NE," Dec. 23, 2009",American Airlines is the worst airlines to fly anywhere. They cram you in the seats with no leg room or any room for that matter. I requested a wheelchair at airport and waited 30 minutes upon someone finally arriving. They took me the wrong way to my next check in and I missed my flight. They said I would have to rebook my ticket and just wait for the next flight. Attendant at the gate was very disrespectful and not helpful at all. I had no control over this situation at all. Not to mention when I did finally arrive at my destination that I requested a wheelchair prior to my departure.
Michelle of Chico, CA," Dec. 23, 2009","American Airlines is the worst airline in THE WORLD, and should change their name, it is utterly disgraceful that as an American they use this name. Their policy is to not apologize for anything, to be as rude as possible to people who are basically held hostage to them and their BS policies like closing the door to the gate while people are standing there then charging them money to rebook their flight, not caring at all about the bags on their way to a destination without the owners there to pick them up. Then being told when lodging a complaint that it was going in one ear and out the other. I have never been treated so poorly in my life, I will never again fly with this airline, I hope they go bankrupt and get the worst karma life can give. Oh yeah and I get to fly with them tomorrow. :/"
Daniel of Barra De Carrasco, OTHER," Dec. 22, 2009","Very disappointed. Unlikely I will ever choose American Airlines again. I didn't make my flight in the spring. I was given a voucher to use for future travel. Now I'm being told I can only use it myself, and not for my family. I don't want to use it for myself. What difference does it make? I'm being told different things by different people. The last guy hung up on me and I wasn't even rude to him. This is how AA does business? All I want is to not be penalized for cancelling a flight that was beyond my control. If you have a voucher it should be flexible to use for anyone. AA is the WORST! Hope they go out of business for this nonsense. Airline travel is a joke."
Daniel of San Ramon, CA," Dec. 22, 2009","American Airlines canceled my 92-year-old father-in-law's flight to Key West due to Hurricane Irma. On that day American Airline was contacted and the representative said there would be no problem re-booking, just use the reference number. American Airlines even went on TV and said they would waive re-booking fees. Today when calling to re-book the flight and after 57 minutes on the phone, I was told the flight could not be re-booked because it was in their notes I requested a refund. At no time did I request a refund and American Airlines could not locate any record of a refund request. Even so, American Airlines still insisted they could not re-book the flight or issue a refund. If we did not have enough trouble dealing with a Cat 4 hurricane and its devastating aftermath, now American Airlines is adding to the misery. All my father-in-law wants is to come to Key West and see that everyone is alright. Thanks, AA."
Zarina of Alexandria, VA," Dec. 21, 2009",I bought tickets for my mother in law and son to meet my wife and I in Colorado. We had traveled on different airlines due to connections and therefore were going back on different airlines. My wife and I left on our airplane. My mother in law and son were stranded as the plane had a mechanical. This was 8 AM and the bottom line was it didn't get fixed that day. American gave them a 12.00 voucher good in the terminal and did nothing to get them a room as the rooms they usually used weren't available.
Jamal of Elkridge, MD," Dec. 21, 2009","I booked 2 separate flights on American Airlines in Economy since I pay for my air travel. On one they pre-assigned me a back-of-plane middle seat and said that I was required to pay some increased fee for window, aisle or closer to the front. On the second flight they said I have to wait until I reach the boarding gate for any seat. This is ridiculous and unacceptable. The airline has sufficient revenue to - just a suggestion - increase the ""base"" fare to cover a first-come-first-served seat selection and not put everyone into 3rd class or worse status. If they want to surcharge certain premium seats, like middle seats toward the front, that's OK, but this behavior is totally unacceptable and I refuse to fly them (or any airline) that abuses their passengers."
Timothy of Saratoga Springs, NY," Dec. 18, 2009",Well I looked into changing my flight for my fiance and I to go home a day earlier... only to discover that American charges $200.00 a ticket PLUS the difference in price tickets! LIKE THAT IS GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE! So for the price of another ticket I can change my flight! I will be looking elsewhere for flights in the future. I have already paid for a flight and now you are trying to rip me off even more!?! Out of touch and terrible service to a customer of over 5 years. I will be going elsewhere where I don't get bent over the table. Thank you American!

I was informed by two customer service representatives that I would be able to rebook my flight to Miami with no additional charges in fare and no change fees. Of course, when it comes time to book my flight, I'm informed about a change fee. I told the agent, I was reassured twice that I would not be charged any additional fees because my initial cancellation was weather related. "
Cristiano of San Diego, CA," Dec. 8, 2009","American Airlines is full of **. Our cruise was cancelled due to Hurricane Irma. It was beyond our control and the airline stated there was nothing that they could do. No partial credit, changes or anything! I will not be flying with them anymore!"
Ashley of Monterey, CA," Dec. 4, 2009",My husband and I were scheduled to fly out at 7:15 am to go to California for a very important family matter. We do not live near the airport so we were up early to make sure we were early and nothing could go wrong. But things did go wrong. When we got to the airport we went and printed out tickets at the self checkout. We did notice that it mentioned no overhead storage for our carry on bags. So confused because we fly a lot and there is always overhead storage or they place in under the cabin. So we asked a lady that was standing in the area of self print and she looked and our tickets said we would be fine... Again we were told wrong.
Deirdra of Escondido, CA," Dec. 4, 2009","On September 4 my family of 5 arrived at the airport in Anchorage to fly home to Toronto via Dallas. Four of us had carry-on sized luggage but one had a mid-sized suitcase that we knew we would have to check. Our flight to Toronto included a 12.5-hour connection at DFW (not by choice). Since none of us sleep well on planes, we were considering going to a hotel following the overnight flight to DFW. When checking the suitcase, I specifically asked the American Airlines agent ""if we only check this bag to DFW and then go to a hotel for a few hours of sleep, will we be charged a second baggage fee to check the bag in for the flight to Toronto? If so we can rearrange the bags so that we can just check it through to Toronto."" "

In the future, I will do all I can to avoid flying with your airline and don't count on a positive recommendation from me to others! Also, stop charging for the first piece of checked in luggage!"

Judith of Farmington Hills, MI," Nov. 24, 2009","I was scheduled to fly out of Tampa International on Sunday, September, 17th to Durango, CO. I live in Sarasota, and just returned home the other day after evacuating for Hurricane Irma. I fled Florida and headed to Georgia, where I had to rent a hotel for a few nights. When I returned home I was fortunate enough not to have suffered damage. I of course have yard debris strewn about and I am still without power. The power company has estimated by the end of the day on September 22nd I will have power. With the extra costs incurred from having to leave my home, and the loss of power, I decided this was not a good time to travel."
donna of Fort Wayne, IN," Nov. 22, 2009","Hurricane Irma was mess for AA. I get it. I'm sure there were thousands who were stuck trying to get their flights changed. Unfortunately, I was in Costa Rica with a connection via Miami and I got, as the AA agent said ""the short end of the stick."" I would be stuck almost another week in Costa Rica as everything AA had was booked out or cancelled. I saw a little bit of silver lining when I found that if I could get to Mexico city, I could fly home via DFW. However, AA would not change the ticket as it is against their rules to change the country of origin on a ticket. ""We cannot do it."" However, a more accurate description is ""will not."""
Noel of Richmond, VA," Nov. 19, 2009","We were delayed on our AA out of Seattle due to having to wait on flight crew. Managed to make it to Dallas on time BUT had to sit on the tarmac for 20 mins waiting for a gait in order to deplane. This caused to miss our connecting flight. Next available flight is the next day. Asked about compensation for overnight hotel stay (there are 7 in our party, including a 3 year old) and were denied due to the delay being coded as weather related, which is absolutely bogus. So livid, frustrated, and tired at this point. Also found out AA has no number to call for complaints... You have to go through email so who knows if they will even read it or reply. Will never fly AA again if I can help it."
Damian of Wesley Chapel, FL," Nov. 15, 2009","I was on an almost 2 hour flight (Flight AA3936) stuck sitting with one leg over my bag and the other on the edge of the aisle. Not once was I asked to check in my bag nor told it wouldn't fit on the overhead bin. By the time we landed my knees, hips and back were killing me and I had to have help from the gentleman next to me to be able to stand up. So glad there wasn't an emergency 'cause this would have been one hell of a hazard. Lesson learned not to use this airline again."
Mike of Alma, KS," Nov. 12, 2009","American Airlines‰Û_the new standard for horrible service. Oh‰Û_I mean HORRIBLE! I travel very frequently for work and have stuck to one specific airline in order to build my status with them (ie. first class upgrades often, better seat choices, free checked bags). Recently, service has taken a turn for the worse. I‰Ûªm a reasonable guy and tolerate more than most. Call it my Southern hospitality, my upbringing or my service to the community when I served in law enforcement, but I just plain put up with more‰Û_until now."
Annabelle of San Antonio, OTHER," Nov. 11, 2009","I travel 80%~ for Work and have flown with almost every airline multiple times. AA is by far the worst. Not due to their customer service/staff/delays or anything like that (at least that I‰Ûªve noticed), but their planes have no entertainment system on each seat, they do not play movies on the overhead screens, and they don‰Ûªt even have a free WiFi movie/tv option you can connect to using your phone! I‰Ûªm currently on a flight from Boston to Phoenix and was utterly shocked when I sat in my seat and noticed no form of entertainment for a cross-country flight. Delta and other airlines provide personal entertainment screens on each screen or a smartphone connect feature for 2+ hr flights, which in turn make the flights more enjoyable. Anyways, to avoid rambling on and on about the lack of technology on AA planes I‰Ûªll just say if you enjoyed traveling in the late 90s early 2000s, then AA is for you. If you want to travel in 2017 and beyond, find a different airline."
loly of West Palm Beach, FL," Nov. 9, 2009","I had a horrible experience today on my flight back to Miami. I have been an AAdvantage member for many years now and have always chosen to be loyal to American but after today's experience that may change. The onboarding process was fine and the flight was on time, which to be honest is rare but I was happy. When the snacks and beverage cart came the attendant did not smile, looked unhappy to take our beverage order, handed me and my husband 2 cookies, I then I told her, ""Can we just get pretzels?"" She said ""Then I need the cookies back."" I was honestly appalled."
Joanne of Toronto, ON," Nov. 5, 2009","Don't deserve single star. Also, I have a flight from Chicago to Minneapolis 5 hours from now. And they have seats available on the earlier flight but won't give you without charging $75. They are ok to make you wait or fly a flight with empty seats but no customer delight which is no cost to them. No customer driven company and not looking for going extra mile to make customer happy. Never travel on American Airlines again."
Brian of Conroe, TX," Nov. 4, 2009","Worst experience ever with AA never again, they treated my dad like garbage, they humiliated my dad in front of my niece travelling with him and in front of all passengers, just because my dad is ** and not fluent in English. I wish I could sue them for discrimination against my dad for not speaking English fluent instead of offering assistance in Spanish which, the sky harbor airport in Arizona has plenty of bilingual employees. DO NOT FLY AA EVER, pay more with a different airline. The only reason why my dad and niece flew AA to go to my brother's funeral, thank you AA for the worst day ever. It's a shame I have to put a star instead of no stars service."
Andy of Philadelphia, PA," Oct. 27, 2009","This American Airlines review is out of frustration due to a lot of things. They're a disgrace! The employees are rude, there is no leg room, no entertainment, and treat people like herds of sheep. They have a ""New"" rule where they charge $50 at the gate to carry on your luggage. Are you kidding me? $50 for a carry on? And I can't even use the overhead bin! Disgraceful! Basically these guys are crooks! They're a disgrace. Last time I flew with American their flight was delayed by 2 hours and we ended up missing our connecting flight because it was the last flight out. We ended up having to stay an extra day and had to pay $100 for a hotel. We missed my sisters wedding. On the way back we ended up stuck on the tarmac for 2 hours. Of course!"
Patty of Mission Viejo, CA," Oct. 26, 2009","I booked a ticket back when the hurricane were hitting down south every other week. Because of that I was not able to attend my trip in GA. They told me I had up to a year to use my ticket. So when I try to rebook my ticket they are now close to $500. Mind you this is the highest rate out of all the airlines for my particular dates, I asked for a refund because I didn't wanna double what I paid the first time and I was told by the Supervisor (Willie ** in Dallas ) that my only option was to ""use it or lost it"". Being a supervisor myself I thought the tone in which he said it was very careless and he didn't try to help the situation at all. I would never talk to my customers the way he spoke to me especially after losing out on $300!!"
Sheila of Clifton Park, NY," Oct. 24, 2009","I just completed a flight on American Airlines. I had read negative reviews, but I found the American Airlines people I had contact with were great, tried to provide all the service they could because our flight had been cancelled due WX and had to layover at ORD. My complaint is the phoney coupon given for a hotel room for a ""discounted rate"". The coupon has nothing to do with American Airlines, but is only a hotel booking service. When I called the phone number provided I was told the only available room was 10 miles away and given a rate of $80.00. It was getting late in the evening so took it. Then was advised there was a $15 service charge to book the room. American Airline paid none of this. The shuttle bus to the hotel was packed (Other delayed passengers). When I got home I checked the hotel rate and found the same room went for $105. I ""saved"" $10. The hotel was a Holiday Inn Express. Room not bad."

She made up some baloney about Homeland Security not letting people fly with spots on their passport. I told her I checked their website and there was no mention of anything like that. She then claimed, ""Oh, they don't tell you."" I said, ""Then how are you supposed to know?""

However, AA would not change the ticket as it is against their rules to change the country of origin on a ticket. ""We cannot do it."" However, a more accurate description is ""will not."""
Louisa of Cape Canaveral, FL," Sept. 5, 2009","We were delayed on our AA out of Seattle due to having to wait on flight crew. Managed to make it to Dallas on time BUT had to sit on the tarmac for 20 mins waiting for a gait in order to deplane. This caused to miss our connecting flight. Next available flight is the next day. Asked about compensation for overnight hotel stay (there are 7 in our party, including a 3 year old) and were denied due to the delay being coded as weather related, which is absolutely bogus. So livid, frustrated, and tired at this point. Also found out AA has no number to call for complaints... You have to go through email so who knows if they will even read it or reply. Will never fly AA again if I can help it."
Allison of Medford, OR," Aug. 29, 2009","I was on an almost 2 hour flight (Flight AA3936) stuck sitting with one leg over my bag and the other on the edge of the aisle. Not once was I asked to check in my bag nor told it wouldn't fit on the overhead bin. By the time we landed my knees, hips and back were killing me and I had to have help from the gentleman next to me to be able to stand up. So glad there wasn't an emergency 'cause this would have been one hell of a hazard. Lesson learned not to use this airline again."
Ratheesh of Baltimore, MD," Aug. 28, 2009","American Airlines‰Û_the new standard for horrible service. Oh‰Û_I mean HORRIBLE! I travel very frequently for work and have stuck to one specific airline in order to build my status with them (ie. first class upgrades often, better seat choices, free checked bags). Recently, service has taken a turn for the worse. I‰Ûªm a reasonable guy and tolerate more than most. Call it my Southern hospitality, my upbringing or my service to the community when I served in law enforcement, but I just plain put up with more‰Û_until now."
Renato of Sao Paulo, Other," Aug. 28, 2009","I travel 80%~ for Work and have flown with almost every airline multiple times. AA is by far the worst. Not due to their customer service/staff/delays or anything like that (at least that I‰Ûªve noticed), but their planes have no entertainment system on each seat, they do not play movies on the overhead screens, and they don‰Ûªt even have a free WiFi movie/tv option you can connect to using your phone! I‰Ûªm currently on a flight from Boston to Phoenix and was utterly shocked when I sat in my seat and noticed no form of entertainment for a cross-country flight. Delta and other airlines provide personal entertainment screens on each screen or a smartphone connect feature for 2+ hr flights, which in turn make the flights more enjoyable. Anyways, to avoid rambling on and on about the lack of technology on AA planes I‰Ûªll just say if you enjoyed traveling in the late 90s early 2000s, then AA is for you. If you want to travel in 2017 and beyond, find a different airline."
Liza of Astoria, NY," Aug. 27, 2009","I had a horrible experience today on my flight back to Miami. I have been an AAdvantage member for many years now and have always chosen to be loyal to American but after today's experience that may change. The onboarding process was fine and the flight was on time, which to be honest is rare but I was happy. When the snacks and beverage cart came the attendant did not smile, looked unhappy to take our beverage order, handed me and my husband 2 cookies, I then I told her, ""Can we just get pretzels?"" She said ""Then I need the cookies back."" I was honestly appalled."
Luciana of Nyc, ny," Aug. 27, 2009","Don't deserve single star. Also, I have a flight from Chicago to Minneapolis 5 hours from now. And they have seats available on the earlier flight but won't give you without charging $75. They are ok to make you wait or fly a flight with empty seats but no customer delight which is no cost to them. No customer driven company and not looking for going extra mile to make customer happy. Never travel on American Airlines again."
Patricia of Bedford Hills, NY," Aug. 26, 2009","Worst experience ever with AA never again, they treated my dad like garbage, they humiliated my dad in front of my niece travelling with him and in front of all passengers, just because my dad is ** and not fluent in English. I wish I could sue them for discrimination against my dad for not speaking English fluent instead of offering assistance in Spanish which, the sky harbor airport in Arizona has plenty of bilingual employees. DO NOT FLY AA EVER, pay more with a different airline. The only reason why my dad and niece flew AA to go to my brother's funeral, thank you AA for the worst day ever. It's a shame I have to put a star instead of no stars service."
Gabriella of Georgetown, TX," Aug. 25, 2009","This American Airlines review is out of frustration due to a lot of things. They're a disgrace! The employees are rude, there is no leg room, no entertainment, and treat people like herds of sheep. They have a ""New"" rule where they charge $50 at the gate to carry on your luggage. Are you kidding me? $50 for a carry on? And I can't even use the overhead bin! Disgraceful! Basically these guys are crooks! They're a disgrace. Last time I flew with American their flight was delayed by 2 hours and we ended up missing our connecting flight because it was the last flight out. We ended up having to stay an extra day and had to pay $100 for a hotel. We missed my sisters wedding. On the way back we ended up stuck on the tarmac for 2 hours. Of course!"
Dr. of Temecula, CA," Aug. 24, 2009","I booked a ticket back when the hurricane were hitting down south every other week. Because of that I was not able to attend my trip in GA. They told me I had up to a year to use my ticket. So when I try to rebook my ticket they are now close to $500. Mind you this is the highest rate out of all the airlines for my particular dates, I asked for a refund because I didn't wanna double what I paid the first time and I was told by the Supervisor (Willie ** in Dallas ) that my only option was to ""use it or lost it"". Being a supervisor myself I thought the tone in which he said it was very careless and he didn't try to help the situation at all. I would never talk to my customers the way he spoke to me especially after losing out on $300!!"
Jim of New York, NY," Aug. 19, 2009","I just completed a flight on American Airlines. I had read negative reviews, but I found the American Airlines people I had contact with were great, tried to provide all the service they could because our flight had been cancelled due WX and had to layover at ORD. My complaint is the phoney coupon given for a hotel room for a ""discounted rate"". The coupon has nothing to do with American Airlines, but is only a hotel booking service. When I called the phone number provided I was told the only available room was 10 miles away and given a rate of $80.00. It was getting late in the evening so took it. Then was advised there was a $15 service charge to book the room. American Airline paid none of this. The shuttle bus to the hotel was packed (Other delayed passengers). When I got home I checked the hotel rate and found the same room went for $105. I ""saved"" $10. The hotel was a Holiday Inn Express. Room not bad."

She made up some baloney about Homeland Security not letting people fly with spots on their passport. I told her I checked their website and there was no mention of anything like that. She then claimed, ""Oh, they don't tell you."" I said, ""Then how are you supposed to know?""

Phyllis of Winter Haven, FL," Aug. 15, 2009","Where do I even begin? I had a round trip flight booked from Toronto, Ontario to Busan, South Korea back in the month of July (2017). While I was away, I heard the news that my dad had passed away. In which, I contacted American Airlines right away and asked if anything can be done. I wanted to fly back before my actual trip date, due to obvious reasons. I even offered to provide them with a death certificate if need be (although, I don't think that is even something they should ask for right away). I spoke to 3 different customer service reps who were all horrible to speak with. They had zero compassion and empathy and just dismissed me as if what I was experiencing was far from a big deal to them. "
Lisa of Fresno, CA," Aug. 13, 2009","I was on the plane for 14 hours due to a delay. Sitting in a broken seat that would not recline. I told the stewardess and she could care less, said nothing she can do. After I got home I contacted the airline and they issued me a fourteen dollar credit. I had paid 197.34 dollars for preferred seats. The worst flight of my life, never again w/ this airline."
Rebecca of Milwaukee, WI," Aug. 12, 2009","Overall, (Un)American Airlines continues to disappoint. I really only ever fly with AA as a last resort, and I can't see any reason to recommend traveling with AA. I was prior active duty Army, and now I'm a reservist, and only American Airlines makes me feel like my service is less important now. United, Southwest, Jet Blue, Delta, every other airline doesn't discriminate between Active Duty and Reserve/Guardsmen when it comes to bag fees. So, along with uncomfortable, outdated planes and poor service, I spent a $100 checking bags to and from my destination."
Mervis of Handsworth, other," Aug. 12, 2009",American Airlines is the worst airlines to fly anywhere. They cram you in the seats with no leg room or any room for that matter. I requested a wheelchair at airport and waited 30 minutes upon someone finally arriving. They took me the wrong way to my next check in and I missed my flight. They said I would have to rebook my ticket and just wait for the next flight. Attendant at the gate was very disrespectful and not helpful at all. I had no control over this situation at all. Not to mention when I did finally arrive at my destination that I requested a wheelchair prior to my departure.
Jeff of Austin, TX," Aug. 10, 2009","American Airlines is the worst airline in THE WORLD, and should change their name, it is utterly disgraceful that as an American they use this name. Their policy is to not apologize for anything, to be as rude as possible to people who are basically held hostage to them and their BS policies like closing the door to the gate while people are standing there then charging them money to rebook their flight, not caring at all about the bags on their way to a destination without the owners there to pick them up. Then being told when lodging a complaint that it was going in one ear and out the other. I have never been treated so poorly in my life, I will never again fly with this airline, I hope they go bankrupt and get the worst karma life can give. Oh yeah and I get to fly with them tomorrow. :/"
Rodney of Valrico, FL," Aug. 8, 2009","Very disappointed. Unlikely I will ever choose American Airlines again. I didn't make my flight in the spring. I was given a voucher to use for future travel. Now I'm being told I can only use it myself, and not for my family. I don't want to use it for myself. What difference does it make? I'm being told different things by different people. The last guy hung up on me and I wasn't even rude to him. This is how AA does business? All I want is to not be penalized for cancelling a flight that was beyond my control. If you have a voucher it should be flexible to use for anyone. AA is the WORST! Hope they go out of business for this nonsense. Airline travel is a joke."
Robin of Roslyn, NY," Aug. 8, 2009","American Airlines canceled my 92-year-old father-in-law's flight to Key West due to Hurricane Irma. On that day American Airline was contacted and the representative said there would be no problem re-booking, just use the reference number. American Airlines even went on TV and said they would waive re-booking fees. Today when calling to re-book the flight and after 57 minutes on the phone, I was told the flight could not be re-booked because it was in their notes I requested a refund. At no time did I request a refund and American Airlines could not locate any record of a refund request. Even so, American Airlines still insisted they could not re-book the flight or issue a refund. If we did not have enough trouble dealing with a Cat 4 hurricane and its devastating aftermath, now American Airlines is adding to the misery. All my father-in-law wants is to come to Key West and see that everyone is alright. Thanks, AA."
Jeffrey of Jasper, IN," Aug. 8, 2009",I bought tickets for my mother in law and son to meet my wife and I in Colorado. We had traveled on different airlines due to connections and therefore were going back on different airlines. My wife and I left on our airplane. My mother in law and son were stranded as the plane had a mechanical. This was 8 AM and the bottom line was it didn't get fixed that day. American gave them a 12.00 voucher good in the terminal and did nothing to get them a room as the rooms they usually used weren't available.
Joan of Brookhaven, PA," Aug. 6, 2009","I booked 2 separate flights on American Airlines in Economy since I pay for my air travel. On one they pre-assigned me a back-of-plane middle seat and said that I was required to pay some increased fee for window, aisle or closer to the front. On the second flight they said I have to wait until I reach the boarding gate for any seat. This is ridiculous and unacceptable. The airline has sufficient revenue to - just a suggestion - increase the ""base"" fare to cover a first-come-first-served seat selection and not put everyone into 3rd class or worse status. If they want to surcharge certain premium seats, like middle seats toward the front, that's OK, but this behavior is totally unacceptable and I refuse to fly them (or any airline) that abuses their passengers."
Mary of Gloucester, VA," Aug. 5, 2009",Well I looked into changing my flight for my fiance and I to go home a day earlier... only to discover that American charges $200.00 a ticket PLUS the difference in price tickets! LIKE THAT IS GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE! So for the price of another ticket I can change my flight! I will be looking elsewhere for flights in the future. I have already paid for a flight and now you are trying to rip me off even more!?! Out of touch and terrible service to a customer of over 5 years. I will be going elsewhere where I don't get bent over the table. Thank you American!
Annabelle of Downey , CA," July 30, 2009","I originally booked my flight to Miami from Washington, DC back in July 2017. I was scheduled to fly September 13-18, 2017. I, like many, had to cancel my trip because of hurricane Irma. I was informed by two customer service representatives that I would be able to rebook my flight to Miami with no additional charges in fare and no change fees. Of course, when it comes time to book my flight, I'm informed about a change fee. I told the agent, I was reassured twice that I would not be charged any additional fees because my initial cancellation was weather related. "
Candice of Phoenix, AZ," July 30, 2009","American Airlines is full of **. Our cruise was cancelled due to Hurricane Irma. It was beyond our control and the airline stated there was nothing that they could do. No partial credit, changes or anything! I will not be flying with them anymore!"
Norma of St. Thoms, other," July 30, 2009",My husband and I were scheduled to fly out at 7:15 am to go to California for a very important family matter. We do not live near the airport so we were up early to make sure we were early and nothing could go wrong. But things did go wrong. When we got to the airport we went and printed out tickets at the self checkout. We did notice that it mentioned no overhead storage for our carry on bags. So confused because we fly a lot and there is always overhead storage or they place in under the cabin. So we asked a lady that was standing in the area of self print and she looked and our tickets said we would be fine... Again we were told wrong.
Patrick of Lillington, NC," July 30, 2009","On September 4 my family of 5 arrived at the airport in Anchorage to fly home to Toronto via Dallas. Four of us had carry-on sized luggage but one had a mid-sized suitcase that we knew we would have to check. Our flight to Toronto included a 12.5-hour connection at DFW (not by choice). Since none of us sleep well on planes, we were considering going to a hotel following the overnight flight to DFW. When checking the suitcase, I specifically asked the American Airlines agent ""if we only check this bag to DFW and then go to a hotel for a few hours of sleep, will we be charged a second baggage fee to check the bag in for the flight to Toronto? If so we can rearrange the bags so that we can just check it through to Toronto."" "
Gary of Doylestown, PA," July 30, 2009","I purchased the basic economy ticket. When I was getting ready to board in Charlotte, the attendant mentioned that this was a new program for your airline and that customers have stated it was cost effective. However, this was not my case! I paid nearly $600 to fly from Columbus, OH to Asheville, NC. Absolutely absurd!!! In the future, I will do all I can to avoid flying with your airline and don't count on a positive recommendation from me to others! Also, stop charging for the first piece of checked in luggage!"

I called at night again because I was worried I saw it was still cancel. After almost 2 hours they answered the phone. I told them what happened. They told me that they were very sorry but the flight was canceled and they didnt' have flight for Sept 12. They gave me 1 stop flight for Sept 13. "
Harry of Union City, CA," July 22, 2009","I was scheduled to fly out of Tampa International on Sunday, September, 17th to Durango, CO. I live in Sarasota, and just returned home the other day after evacuating for Hurricane Irma. I fled Florida and headed to Georgia, where I had to rent a hotel for a few nights. When I returned home I was fortunate enough not to have suffered damage. I of course have yard debris strewn about and I am still without power. The power company has estimated by the end of the day on September 22nd I will have power. With the extra costs incurred from having to leave my home, and the loss of power, I decided this was not a good time to travel."

Now I'm being told I can only use it myself, and not for my family. I don't want to use it for myself. What difference does it make? I'm being told different things by different people. The last guy hung up on me and I wasn't even rude to him. This is how AA does business? All I want is to not be penalized for cancelling a flight that was beyond my control. If you have a voucher it should be flexible to use for anyone. AA is the WORST! Hope they go out of business for this nonsense. Airline travel is a joke."
Kathleen of Morrisville, PA," June 19, 2009","American Airlines canceled my 92-year-old father-in-law's flight to Key West due to Hurricane Irma. On that day American Airline was contacted and the representative said there would be no problem re-booking, just use the reference number. American Airlines even went on TV and said they would waive re-booking fees. Today when calling to re-book the flight and after 57 minutes on the phone, I was told the flight could not be re-booked because it was in their notes I requested a refund. At no time did I request a refund and American Airlines could not locate any record of a refund request. Even so, American Airlines still insisted they could not re-book the flight or issue a refund. If we did not have enough trouble dealing with a Cat 4 hurricane and its devastating aftermath, now American Airlines is adding to the misery. All my father-in-law wants is to come to Key West and see that everyone is alright. Thanks, AA."
Erikalynn of Bonaire, GA," June 17, 2009",I bought tickets for my mother in law and son to meet my wife and I in Colorado. We had traveled on different airlines due to connections and therefore were going back on different airlines. My wife and I left on our airplane. My mother in law and son were stranded as the plane had a mechanical. This was 8 AM and the bottom line was it didn't get fixed that day. American gave them a 12.00 voucher good in the terminal and did nothing to get them a room as the rooms they usually used weren't available.
Patrick of Kensington, NH," June 16, 2009","I booked 2 separate flights on American Airlines in Economy since I pay for my air travel. On one they pre-assigned me a back-of-plane middle seat and said that I was required to pay some increased fee for window, aisle or closer to the front. On the second flight they said I have to wait until I reach the boarding gate for any seat. This is ridiculous and unacceptable. The airline has sufficient revenue to - just a suggestion - increase the ""base"" fare to cover a first-come-first-served seat selection and not put everyone into 3rd class or worse status. If they want to surcharge certain premium seats, like middle seats toward the front, that's OK, but this behavior is totally unacceptable and I refuse to fly them (or any airline) that abuses their passengers."
Nathan of Seattle, WA," June 15, 2009",Well I looked into changing my flight for my fiance and I to go home a day earlier... only to discover that American charges $200.00 a ticket PLUS the difference in price tickets! LIKE THAT IS GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE! So for the price of another ticket I can change my flight! I will be looking elsewhere for flights in the future. I have already paid for a flight and now you are trying to rip me off even more!?! Out of touch and terrible service to a customer of over 5 years. I will be going elsewhere where I don't get bent over the table. Thank you American!
Randall of Owasso, OK," June 11, 2009","I originally booked my flight to Miami from Washington, DC back in July 2017. I was scheduled to fly September 13-18, 2017. I, like many, had to cancel my trip because of hurricane Irma. I was informed by two customer service representatives that I would be able to rebook my flight to Miami with no additional charges in fare and no change fees. Of course, when it comes time to book my flight, I'm informed about a change fee. I told the agent, I was reassured twice that I would not be charged any additional fees because my initial cancellation was weather related. "
Brian of Castro Valley, CA," June 11, 2009","American Airlines is full of **. Our cruise was cancelled due to Hurricane Irma. It was beyond our control and the airline stated there was nothing that they could do. No partial credit, changes or anything! I will not be flying with them anymore!"
Margaret of Westfield, NJ," June 9, 2009",My husband and I were scheduled to fly out at 7:15 am to go to California for a very important family matter. We do not live near the airport so we were up early to make sure we were early and nothing could go wrong. But things did go wrong. When we got to the airport we went and printed out tickets at the self checkout. We did notice that it mentioned no overhead storage for our carry on bags. So confused because we fly a lot and there is always overhead storage or they place in under the cabin. So we asked a lady that was standing in the area of self print and she looked and our tickets said we would be fine... Again we were told wrong.
Christine of Stone Mountain, GA," June 8, 2009","On September 4 my family of 5 arrived at the airport in Anchorage to fly home to Toronto via Dallas. Four of us had carry-on sized luggage but one had a mid-sized suitcase that we knew we would have to check. Our flight to Toronto included a 12.5-hour connection at DFW (not by choice). Since none of us sleep well on planes, we were considering going to a hotel following the overnight flight to DFW. When checking the suitcase, I specifically asked the American Airlines agent ""if we only check this bag to DFW and then go to a hotel for a few hours of sleep, will we be charged a second baggage fee to check the bag in for the flight to Toronto? If so we can rearrange the bags so that we can just check it through to Toronto."" "
Anna of Alamogordo, NM," June 7, 2009","I purchased the basic economy ticket. When I was getting ready to board in Charlotte, the attendant mentioned that this was a new program for your airline and that customers have stated it was cost effective. However, this was not my case! I paid nearly $600 to fly from Columbus, OH to Asheville, NC. Absolutely absurd!!! In the future, I will do all I can to avoid flying with your airline and don't count on a positive recommendation from me to others! Also, stop charging for the first piece of checked in luggage!"

I called at night again because I was worried I saw it was still cancel. After almost 2 hours they answered the phone. I told them what happened. They told me that they were very sorry but the flight was canceled and they didnt' have flight for Sept 12. They gave me 1 stop flight for Sept 13. "
Chris of McKinney, TX," June 2, 2009","I was scheduled to fly out of Tampa International on Sunday, September, 17th to Durango, CO. I live in Sarasota, and just returned home the other day after evacuating for Hurricane Irma. I fled Florida and headed to Georgia, where I had to rent a hotel for a few nights. When I returned home I was fortunate enough not to have suffered damage. I of course have yard debris strewn about and I am still without power. The power company has estimated by the end of the day on September 22nd I will have power. With the extra costs incurred from having to leave my home, and the loss of power, I decided this was not a good time to travel."
Silvia of Sanford, FL," June 2, 2009","Hurricane Irma was mess for AA. I get it. I'm sure there were thousands who were stuck trying to get their flights changed. Unfortunately, I was in Costa Rica with a connection via Miami and I got, as the AA agent said ""the short end of the stick."" I would be stuck almost another week in Costa Rica as everything AA had was booked out or cancelled. I saw a little bit of silver lining when I found that if I could get to Mexico city, I could fly home via DFW. However, AA would not change the ticket as it is against their rules to change the country of origin on a ticket. ""We cannot do it."" However, a more accurate description is ""will not."""
Claudia of Lake Ronkonkoma, NY," June 2, 2009","We were delayed on our AA out of Seattle due to having to wait on flight crew. Managed to make it to Dallas on time BUT had to sit on the tarmac for 20 mins waiting for a gait in order to deplane. This caused to miss our connecting flight. Next available flight is the next day. Asked about compensation for overnight hotel stay (there are 7 in our party, including a 3 year old) and were denied due to the delay being coded as weather related, which is absolutely bogus. So livid, frustrated, and tired at this point. Also found out AA has no number to call for complaints... You have to go through email so who knows if they will even read it or reply. Will never fly AA again if I can help it."
Kristin of Naples, FL," June 1, 2009","I was on an almost 2 hour flight (Flight AA3936) stuck sitting with one leg over my bag and the other on the edge of the aisle. Not once was I asked to check in my bag nor told it wouldn't fit on the overhead bin. By the time we landed my knees, hips and back were killing me and I had to have help from the gentleman next to me to be able to stand up. So glad there wasn't an emergency 'cause this would have been one hell of a hazard. Lesson learned not to use this airline again."
Regina of Tucson, AZ," May 30, 2009","American Airlines‰Û_the new standard for horrible service. Oh‰Û_I mean HORRIBLE! I travel very frequently for work and have stuck to one specific airline in order to build my status with them (ie. first class upgrades often, better seat choices, free checked bags). Recently, service has taken a turn for the worse. I‰Ûªm a reasonable guy and tolerate more than most. Call it my Southern hospitality, my upbringing or my service to the community when I served in law enforcement, but I just plain put up with more‰Û_until now."
Patience of New City, NY," May 29, 2009","I travel 80%~ for Work and have flown with almost every airline multiple times. AA is by far the worst. Not due to their customer service/staff/delays or anything like that (at least that I‰Ûªve noticed), but their planes have no entertainment system on each seat, they do not play movies on the overhead screens, and they don‰Ûªt even have a free WiFi movie/tv option you can connect to using your phone! I‰Ûªm currently on a flight from Boston to Phoenix and was utterly shocked when I sat in my seat and noticed no form of entertainment for a cross-country flight. Delta and other airlines provide personal entertainment screens on each screen or a smartphone connect feature for 2+ hr flights, which in turn make the flights more enjoyable. Anyways, to avoid rambling on and on about the lack of technology on AA planes I‰Ûªll just say if you enjoyed traveling in the late 90s early 2000s, then AA is for you. If you want to travel in 2017 and beyond, find a different airline."
Laura of Eureka Springs, AR," May 29, 2009","I had a horrible experience today on my flight back to Miami. I have been an AAdvantage member for many years now and have always chosen to be loyal to American but after today's experience that may change. The onboarding process was fine and the flight was on time, which to be honest is rare but I was happy. When the snacks and beverage cart came the attendant did not smile, looked unhappy to take our beverage order, handed me and my husband 2 cookies, I then I told her, ""Can we just get pretzels?"" She said ""Then I need the cookies back."" I was honestly appalled."
Larry of Palo Alto, CA," May 28, 2009","Don't deserve single star. Also, I have a flight from Chicago to Minneapolis 5 hours from now. And they have seats available on the earlier flight but won't give you without charging $75. They are ok to make you wait or fly a flight with empty seats but no customer delight which is no cost to them. No customer driven company and not looking for going extra mile to make customer happy. Never travel on American Airlines again."
Anna of Nutley, NJ," May 27, 2009","Worst experience ever with AA never again, they treated my dad like garbage, they humiliated my dad in front of my niece travelling with him and in front of all passengers, just because my dad is ** and not fluent in English. I wish I could sue them for discrimination against my dad for not speaking English fluent instead of offering assistance in Spanish which, the sky harbor airport in Arizona has plenty of bilingual employees. DO NOT FLY AA EVER, pay more with a different airline. The only reason why my dad and niece flew AA to go to my brother's funeral, thank you AA for the worst day ever. It's a shame I have to put a star instead of no stars service."
Chrissie of Denton, TX," May 26, 2009","This American Airlines review is out of frustration due to a lot of things. They're a disgrace! The employees are rude, there is no leg room, no entertainment, and treat people like herds of sheep. They have a ""New"" rule where they charge $50 at the gate to carry on your luggage. Are you kidding me? $50 for a carry on? And I can't even use the overhead bin! Disgraceful! Basically these guys are crooks! They're a disgrace. Last time I flew with American their flight was delayed by 2 hours and we ended up missing our connecting flight because it was the last flight out. We ended up having to stay an extra day and had to pay $100 for a hotel. We missed my sisters wedding. On the way back we ended up stuck on the tarmac for 2 hours. Of course!"
Brian of St. Louis, MO," May 26, 2009","I booked a ticket back when the hurricane were hitting down south every other week. Because of that I was not able to attend my trip in GA. They told me I had up to a year to use my ticket. So when I try to rebook my ticket they are now close to $500. Mind you this is the highest rate out of all the airlines for my particular dates, I asked for a refund because I didn't wanna double what I paid the first time and I was told by the Supervisor (Willie ** in Dallas ) that my only option was to ""use it or lost it"". Being a supervisor myself I thought the tone in which he said it was very careless and he didn't try to help the situation at all. I would never talk to my customers the way he spoke to me especially after losing out on $300!!"
Vida of Hermosa Beach, CA," May 25, 2009","I just completed a flight on American Airlines. I had read negative reviews, but I found the American Airlines people I had contact with were great, tried to provide all the service they could because our flight had been cancelled due WX and had to layover at ORD. My complaint is the phoney coupon given for a hotel room for a ""discounted rate"". The coupon has nothing to do with American Airlines, but is only a hotel booking service. When I called the phone number provided I was told the only available room was 10 miles away and given a rate of $80.00. It was getting late in the evening so took it. Then was advised there was a $15 service charge to book the room. American Airline paid none of this. The shuttle bus to the hotel was packed (Other delayed passengers). When I got home I checked the hotel rate and found the same room went for $105. I ""saved"" $10. The hotel was a Holiday Inn Express. Room not bad."
Elizabeth of Falls Church, VA," May 22, 2009","I was en route from San Antonio Texas to Hong Kong and when checking in for the domestic portion of the flight at the ticket counter, the woman claimed there was a problem with my passport. I asked for details and she claimed ""There are spots on your passport."" I told her the passport was still valid and did not expire until the following year."" She made up some baloney about Homeland Security not letting people fly with spots on their passport. I told her I checked their website and there was no mention of anything like that. She then claimed, ""Oh, they don't tell you."" I said, ""Then how are you supposed to know?"" She then sarcastically claimed I needed glasses, so I put my glasses on and told her those so called spots are not a problem. "

While I was away, I heard the news that my dad had passed away. In which, I contacted American Airlines right away and asked if anything can be done. I wanted to fly back before my actual trip date, due to obvious reasons. I even offered to provide them with a death certificate if need be (although, I don't think that is even something they should ask for right away). I spoke to 3 different customer service reps who were all horrible to speak with. They had zero compassion and empathy and just dismissed me as if what I was experiencing was far from a big deal to them. "
Zarlasht of Burke, VA," May 20, 2009","I was on the plane for 14 hours due to a delay. Sitting in a broken seat that would not recline. I told the stewardess and she could care less, said nothing she can do. After I got home I contacted the airline and they issued me a fourteen dollar credit. I had paid 197.34 dollars for preferred seats. The worst flight of my life, never again w/ this airline."
Sharon of Napa, CA," May 19, 2009","Overall, (Un)American Airlines continues to disappoint. I really only ever fly with AA as a last resort, and I can't see any reason to recommend traveling with AA. I was prior active duty Army, and now I'm a reservist, and only American Airlines makes me feel like my service is less important now. United, Southwest, Jet Blue, Delta, every other airline doesn't discriminate between Active Duty and Reserve/Guardsmen when it comes to bag fees. So, along with uncomfortable, outdated planes and poor service, I spent a $100 checking bags to and from my destination."
Joyce of Marco Island, FL," May 19, 2009",American Airlines is the worst airlines to fly anywhere. They cram you in the seats with no leg room or any room for that matter. I requested a wheelchair at airport and waited 30 minutes upon someone finally arriving. They took me the wrong way to my next check in and I missed my flight. They said I would have to rebook my ticket and just wait for the next flight. Attendant at the gate was very disrespectful and not helpful at all. I had no control over this situation at all. Not to mention when I did finally arrive at my destination that I requested a wheelchair prior to my departure.
Arden of Boca Raton, FL," May 17, 2009","American Airlines is the worst airline in THE WORLD, and should change their name, it is utterly disgraceful that as an American they use this name. Their policy is to not apologize for anything, to be as rude as possible to people who are basically held hostage to them and their BS policies like closing the door to the gate while people are standing there then charging them money to rebook their flight, not caring at all about the bags on their way to a destination without the owners there to pick them up. Then being told when lodging a complaint that it was going in one ear and out the other. I have never been treated so poorly in my life, I will never again fly with this airline, I hope they go bankrupt and get the worst karma life can give. Oh yeah and I get to fly with them tomorrow. :/"

Heliane of Torrance, CA," April 21, 2009","Don't deserve single star. Also, I have a flight from Chicago to Minneapolis 5 hours from now. And they have seats available on the earlier flight but won't give you without charging $75. They are ok to make you wait or fly a flight with empty seats but no customer delight which is no cost to them. No customer driven company and not looking for going extra mile to make customer happy. Never travel on American Airlines again."
Peter of Los Angeles, CA," April 20, 2009","Worst experience ever with AA never again, they treated my dad like garbage, they humiliated my dad in front of my niece travelling with him and in front of all passengers, just because my dad is ** and not fluent in English. I wish I could sue them for discrimination against my dad for not speaking English fluent instead of offering assistance in Spanish which, the sky harbor airport in Arizona has plenty of bilingual employees. DO NOT FLY AA EVER, pay more with a different airline. The only reason why my dad and niece flew AA to go to my brother's funeral, thank you AA for the worst day ever. It's a shame I have to put a star instead of no stars service."
David of Jamesville, NY," April 20, 2009","This American Airlines review is out of frustration due to a lot of things. They're a disgrace! The employees are rude, there is no leg room, no entertainment, and treat people like herds of sheep. They have a ""New"" rule where they charge $50 at the gate to carry on your luggage. Are you kidding me? $50 for a carry on? And I can't even use the overhead bin! Disgraceful! Basically these guys are crooks! They're a disgrace. Last time I flew with American their flight was delayed by 2 hours and we ended up missing our connecting flight because it was the last flight out. We ended up having to stay an extra day and had to pay $100 for a hotel. We missed my sisters wedding. On the way back we ended up stuck on the tarmac for 2 hours. Of course!"
Dennis of New Rochelle, NY," April 19, 2009","I booked a ticket back when the hurricane were hitting down south every other week. Because of that I was not able to attend my trip in GA.

Mind you this is the highest rate out of all the airlines for my particular dates, I asked for a refund because I didn't wanna double what I paid the first time and I was told by the Supervisor (Willie ** in Dallas ) that my only option was to ""use it or lost it"". Being a supervisor myself I thought the tone in which he said it was very careless and he didn't try to help the situation at all. I would never talk to my customers the way he spoke to me especially after losing out on $300!!"
Carol of Ewing, VA," April 17, 2009","I just completed a flight on American Airlines. I had read negative reviews, but I found the American Airlines people I had contact with were great, tried to provide all the service they could because our flight had been cancelled due WX and had to layover at ORD. My complaint is the phoney coupon given for a hotel room for a ""discounted rate"". The coupon has nothing to do with American Airlines, but is only a hotel booking service. When I called the phone number provided I was told the only available room was 10 miles away and given a rate of $80.00. It was getting late in the evening so took it. Then was advised there was a $15 service charge to book the room. American Airline paid none of this. The shuttle bus to the hotel was packed (Other delayed passengers). When I got home I checked the hotel rate and found the same room went for $105. I ""saved"" $10. The hotel was a Holiday Inn Express. Room not bad."

United, Southwest, Jet Blue, Delta, every other airline doesn't discriminate between Active Duty and Reserve/Guardsmen when it comes to bag fees. So, along with uncomfortable, outdated planes and poor service, I spent a $100 checking bags to and from my destination."
Janice of Sacramento, CA," April 9, 2009",American Airlines is the worst airlines to fly anywhere. They cram you in the seats with no leg room or any room for that matter. I requested a wheelchair at airport and waited 30 minutes upon someone finally arriving. They took me the wrong way to my next check in and I missed my flight. They said I would have to rebook my ticket and just wait for the next flight. Attendant at the gate was very disrespectful and not helpful at all. I had no control over this situation at all. Not to mention when I did finally arrive at my destination that I requested a wheelchair prior to my departure.
Danny of Wellington, OTHER," April 8, 2009","American Airlines is the worst airline in THE WORLD, and should change their name, it is utterly disgraceful that as an American they use this name. Their policy is to not apologize for anything, to be as rude as possible to people who are basically held hostage to them and their BS policies like closing the door to the gate while people are standing there then charging them money to rebook their flight, not caring at all about the bags on their way to a destination without the owners there to pick them up. Then being told when lodging a complaint that it was going in one ear and out the other. I have never been treated so poorly in my life, I will never again fly with this airline, I hope they go bankrupt and get the worst karma life can give. Oh yeah and I get to fly with them tomorrow. :/"
Edward of New York, NY," April 7, 2009","Very disappointed. Unlikely I will ever choose American Airlines again. I didn't make my flight in the spring. I was given a voucher to use for future travel. Now I'm being told I can only use it myself, and not for my family. I don't want to use it for myself. What difference does it make? I'm being told different things by different people. The last guy hung up on me and I wasn't even rude to him. This is how AA does business? All I want is to not be penalized for cancelling a flight that was beyond my control. If you have a voucher it should be flexible to use for anyone. AA is the WORST! Hope they go out of business for this nonsense. Airline travel is a joke."
Michael of Brooklyn, NY," April 6, 2009","American Airlines canceled my 92-year-old father-in-law's flight to Key West due to Hurricane Irma. On that day American Airline was contacted and the representative said there would be no problem re-booking, just use the reference number. American Airlines even went on TV and said they would waive re-booking fees. Today when calling to re-book the flight and after 57 minutes on the phone, I was told the flight could not be re-booked because it was in their notes I requested a refund. At no time did I request a refund and American Airlines could not locate any record of a refund request. Even so, American Airlines still insisted they could not re-book the flight or issue a refund. If we did not have enough trouble dealing with a Cat 4 hurricane and its devastating aftermath, now American Airlines is adding to the misery. All my father-in-law wants is to come to Key West and see that everyone is alright. Thanks, AA."
Kevin of Thousand Oaks, CA," April 3, 2009",I bought tickets for my mother in law and son to meet my wife and I in Colorado. We had traveled on different airlines due to connections and therefore were going back on different airlines. My wife and I left on our airplane. My mother in law and son were stranded as the plane had a mechanical. This was 8 AM and the bottom line was it didn't get fixed that day. American gave them a 12.00 voucher good in the terminal and did nothing to get them a room as the rooms they usually used weren't available.
Karen of Pittsburgh, PA," April 1, 2009","I booked 2 separate flights on American Airlines in Economy since I pay for my air travel. On one they pre-assigned me a back-of-plane middle seat and said that I was required to pay some increased fee for window, aisle or closer to the front. On the second flight they said I have to wait until I reach the boarding gate for any seat. This is ridiculous and unacceptable. The airline has sufficient revenue to - just a suggestion - increase the ""base"" fare to cover a first-come-first-served seat selection and not put everyone into 3rd class or worse status. If they want to surcharge certain premium seats, like middle seats toward the front, that's OK, but this behavior is totally unacceptable and I refuse to fly them (or any airline) that abuses their passengers."
Erica of New York, NY," March 31, 2009",Well I looked into changing my flight for my fiance and I to go home a day earlier... only to discover that American charges $200.00 a ticket PLUS the difference in price tickets! LIKE THAT IS GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE! So for the price of another ticket I can change my flight! I will be looking elsewhere for flights in the future. I have already paid for a flight and now you are trying to rip me off even more!?! Out of touch and terrible service to a customer of over 5 years. I will be going elsewhere where I don't get bent over the table. Thank you American!
Janice of Austin, TX," March 31, 2009","I originally booked my flight to Miami from Washington, DC back in July 2017. I was scheduled to fly September 13-18, 2017.

I was informed by two customer service representatives that I would be able to rebook my flight to Miami with no additional charges in fare and no change fees. Of course, when it comes time to book my flight, I'm informed about a change fee. I told the agent, I was reassured twice that I would not be charged any additional fees because my initial cancellation was weather related. "
Zachary of Chicago, IL," March 31, 2009","American Airlines is full of **. Our cruise was cancelled due to Hurricane Irma. It was beyond our control and the airline stated there was nothing that they could do. No partial credit, changes or anything! I will not be flying with them anymore!"
W of Barcelona, OTHER," March 30, 2009",My husband and I were scheduled to fly out at 7:15 am to go to California for a very important family matter. We do not live near the airport so we were up early to make sure we were early and nothing could go wrong. But things did go wrong. When we got to the airport we went and printed out tickets at the self checkout. We did notice that it mentioned no overhead storage for our carry on bags. So confused because we fly a lot and there is always overhead storage or they place in under the cabin. So we asked a lady that was standing in the area of self print and she looked and our tickets said we would be fine... Again we were told wrong.
Tonya of Wichita, KS," March 30, 2009","On September 4 my family of 5 arrived at the airport in Anchorage to fly home to Toronto via Dallas. Four of us had carry-on sized luggage but one had a mid-sized suitcase that we knew we would have to check. Our flight to Toronto included a 12.5-hour connection at DFW (not by choice). Since none of us sleep well on planes, we were considering going to a hotel following the overnight flight to DFW. When checking the suitcase, I specifically asked the American Airlines agent ""if we only check this bag to DFW and then go to a hotel for a few hours of sleep, will we be charged a second baggage fee to check the bag in for the flight to Toronto? If so we can rearrange the bags so that we can just check it through to Toronto."" "
Kathleen of Amherst, NY," March 28, 2009","I purchased the basic economy ticket. When I was getting ready to board in Charlotte, the attendant mentioned that this was a new program for your airline and that customers have stated it was cost effective. However, this was not my case! I paid nearly $600 to fly from Columbus, OH to Asheville, NC. Absolutely absurd!!! In the future, I will do all I can to avoid flying with your airline and don't count on a positive recommendation from me to others! Also, stop charging for the first piece of checked in luggage!"

I called at night again because I was worried I saw it was still cancel. After almost 2 hours they answered the phone. I told them what happened. They told me that they were very sorry but the flight was canceled and they didnt' have flight for Sept 12. They gave me 1 stop flight for Sept 13. "
William of El Paso, TX," March 26, 2009","I was scheduled to fly out of Tampa International on Sunday, September, 17th to Durango, CO. I live in Sarasota, and just returned home the other day after evacuating for Hurricane Irma. I fled Florida and headed to Georgia, where I had to rent a hotel for a few nights. When I returned home I was fortunate enough not to have suffered damage. I of course have yard debris strewn about and I am still without power. The power company has estimated by the end of the day on September 22nd I will have power. With the extra costs incurred from having to leave my home, and the loss of power, I decided this was not a good time to travel."
Carolina of Richmond, MA," March 24, 2009","Hurricane Irma was mess for AA. I get it. I'm sure there were thousands who were stuck trying to get their flights changed. Unfortunately, I was in Costa Rica with a connection via Miami and I got, as the AA agent said ""the short end of the stick."" I would be stuck almost another week in Costa Rica as everything AA had was booked out or cancelled. I saw a little bit of silver lining when I found that if I could get to Mexico city, I could fly home via DFW. However, AA would not change the ticket as it is against their rules to change the country of origin on a ticket. ""We cannot do it."" However, a more accurate description is ""will not."""
Melissa of Charlotte, NC," March 23, 2009","We were delayed on our AA out of Seattle due to having to wait on flight crew. Managed to make it to Dallas on time BUT had to sit on the tarmac for 20 mins waiting for a gait in order to deplane. This caused to miss our connecting flight. Next available flight is the next day. Asked about compensation for overnight hotel stay (there are 7 in our party, including a 3 year old) and were denied due to the delay being coded as weather related, which is absolutely bogus. So livid, frustrated, and tired at this point. Also found out AA has no number to call for complaints... You have to go through email so who knows if they will even read it or reply. Will never fly AA again if I can help it."
Emilio of Caracas, OTHER," March 18, 2009","I was on an almost 2 hour flight (Flight AA3936) stuck sitting with one leg over my bag and the other on the edge of the aisle. Not once was I asked to check in my bag nor told it wouldn't fit on the overhead bin. By the time we landed my knees, hips and back were killing me and I had to have help from the gentleman next to me to be able to stand up. So glad there wasn't an emergency 'cause this would have been one hell of a hazard. Lesson learned not to use this airline again."
Susan of Port Washington, NY," March 16, 2009","American Airlines‰Û_the new standard for horrible service. Oh‰Û_I mean HORRIBLE! I travel very frequently for work and have stuck to one specific airline in order to build my status with them (ie. first class upgrades often, better seat choices, free checked bags). Recently, service has taken a turn for the worse. I‰Ûªm a reasonable guy and tolerate more than most. Call it my Southern hospitality, my upbringing or my service to the community when I served in law enforcement, but I just plain put up with more‰Û_until now."
Dennis of Southborough, MA," March 16, 2009","I travel 80%~ for Work and have flown with almost every airline multiple times. AA is by far the worst. Not due to their customer service/staff/delays or anything like that (at least that I‰Ûªve noticed), but their planes have no entertainment system on each seat, they do not play movies on the overhead screens, and they don‰Ûªt even have a free WiFi movie/tv option you can connect to using your phone! I‰Ûªm currently on a flight from Boston to Phoenix and was utterly shocked when I sat in my seat and noticed no form of entertainment for a cross-country flight. Delta and other airlines provide personal entertainment screens on each screen or a smartphone connect feature for 2+ hr flights, which in turn make the flights more enjoyable. Anyways, to avoid rambling on and on about the lack of technology on AA planes I‰Ûªll just say if you enjoyed traveling in the late 90s early 2000s, then AA is for you. If you want to travel in 2017 and beyond, find a different airline."

Of course, when it comes time to book my flight, I'm informed about a change fee. I told the agent, I was reassured twice that I would not be charged any additional fees because my initial cancellation was weather related. "
Christina of Simi Valley, CA," Feb. 18, 2009","American Airlines is full of **. Our cruise was cancelled due to Hurricane Irma. It was beyond our control and the airline stated there was nothing that they could do. No partial credit, changes or anything! I will not be flying with them anymore!"
Michael of Rochester, NY," Feb. 18, 2009",My husband and I were scheduled to fly out at 7:15 am to go to California for a very important family matter. We do not live near the airport so we were up early to make sure we were early and nothing could go wrong. But things did go wrong. When we got to the airport we went and printed out tickets at the self checkout. We did notice that it mentioned no overhead storage for our carry on bags. So confused because we fly a lot and there is always overhead storage or they place in under the cabin. So we asked a lady that was standing in the area of self print and she looked and our tickets said we would be fine... Again we were told wrong.
Jean of Raleigh, NC," Feb. 14, 2009","On September 4 my family of 5 arrived at the airport in Anchorage to fly home to Toronto via Dallas. Four of us had carry-on sized luggage but one had a mid-sized suitcase that we knew we would have to check. Our flight to Toronto included a 12.5-hour connection at DFW (not by choice). Since none of us sleep well on planes, we were considering going to a hotel following the overnight flight to DFW. When checking the suitcase, I specifically asked the American Airlines agent ""if we only check this bag to DFW and then go to a hotel for a few hours of sleep, will we be charged a second baggage fee to check the bag in for the flight to Toronto? If so we can rearrange the bags so that we can just check it through to Toronto."" "
Lindsey of Orillia, ON," Feb. 12, 2009","I purchased the basic economy ticket. When I was getting ready to board in Charlotte, the attendant mentioned that this was a new program for your airline and that customers have stated it was cost effective. However, this was not my case! I paid nearly $600 to fly from Columbus, OH to Asheville, NC. Absolutely absurd!!! In the future, I will do all I can to avoid flying with your airline and don't count on a positive recommendation from me to others! Also, stop charging for the first piece of checked in luggage!"

September 11 I checked the flight online and it was canceled. I called customer service. Patricia told me that I was wrong it wasn't cancel. I called at night again because I was worried I saw it was still cancel. After almost 2 hours they answered the phone. I told them what happened. They told me that they were very sorry but the flight was canceled and they didnt' have flight for Sept 12. They gave me 1 stop flight for Sept 13. "
Lynn of Malvern, PA," Feb. 11, 2009","I was scheduled to fly out of Tampa International on Sunday, September, 17th to Durango, CO. I live in Sarasota, and just returned home the other day after evacuating for Hurricane Irma. I fled Florida and headed to Georgia, where I had to rent a hotel for a few nights. When I returned home I was fortunate enough not to have suffered damage. I of course have yard debris strewn about and I am still without power. The power company has estimated by the end of the day on September 22nd I will have power. With the extra costs incurred from having to leave my home, and the loss of power, I decided this was not a good time to travel."
Sherrill of Huntley, IL," Feb. 11, 2009","Hurricane Irma was mess for AA. I get it. I'm sure there were thousands who were stuck trying to get their flights changed. Unfortunately, I was in Costa Rica with a connection via Miami and I got, as the AA agent said ""the short end of the stick."" I would be stuck almost another week in Costa Rica as everything AA had was booked out or cancelled. I saw a little bit of silver lining when I found that if I could get to Mexico city, I could fly home via DFW. However, AA would not change the ticket as it is against their rules to change the country of origin on a ticket. ""We cannot do it."" However, a more accurate description is ""will not."""
Samantha of Garland, TX," Feb. 11, 2009","We were delayed on our AA out of Seattle due to having to wait on flight crew. Managed to make it to Dallas on time BUT had to sit on the tarmac for 20 mins waiting for a gait in order to deplane. This caused to miss our connecting flight. Next available flight is the next day. Asked about compensation for overnight hotel stay (there are 7 in our party, including a 3 year old) and were denied due to the delay being coded as weather related, which is absolutely bogus. So livid, frustrated, and tired at this point. Also found out AA has no number to call for complaints... You have to go through email so who knows if they will even read it or reply. Will never fly AA again if I can help it."
Samantha of Rowlett, TX," Feb. 11, 2009","I was on an almost 2 hour flight (Flight AA3936) stuck sitting with one leg over my bag and the other on the edge of the aisle. Not once was I asked to check in my bag nor told it wouldn't fit on the overhead bin. By the time we landed my knees, hips and back were killing me and I had to have help from the gentleman next to me to be able to stand up. So glad there wasn't an emergency 'cause this would have been one hell of a hazard. Lesson learned not to use this airline again."
Towhid of Antioch, TN," Feb. 10, 2009","American Airlines‰Û_the new standard for horrible service. Oh‰Û_I mean HORRIBLE! I travel very frequently for work and have stuck to one specific airline in order to build my status with them (ie. first class upgrades often, better seat choices, free checked bags). Recently, service has taken a turn for the worse. I‰Ûªm a reasonable guy and tolerate more than most. Call it my Southern hospitality, my upbringing or my service to the community when I served in law enforcement, but I just plain put up with more‰Û_until now."
Sallie of Lumber Bridge, NC," Feb. 10, 2009","I travel 80%~ for Work and have flown with almost every airline multiple times. AA is by far the worst. Not due to their customer service/staff/delays or anything like that (at least that I‰Ûªve noticed), but their planes have no entertainment system on each seat, they do not play movies on the overhead screens, and they don‰Ûªt even have a free WiFi movie/tv option you can connect to using your phone! I‰Ûªm currently on a flight from Boston to Phoenix and was utterly shocked when I sat in my seat and noticed no form of entertainment for a cross-country flight. Delta and other airlines provide personal entertainment screens on each screen or a smartphone connect feature for 2+ hr flights, which in turn make the flights more enjoyable. Anyways, to avoid rambling on and on about the lack of technology on AA planes I‰Ûªll just say if you enjoyed traveling in the late 90s early 2000s, then AA is for you. If you want to travel in 2017 and beyond, find a different airline."
Kim of Powhatan, VA," Feb. 9, 2009","I had a horrible experience today on my flight back to Miami. I have been an AAdvantage member for many years now and have always chosen to be loyal to American but after today's experience that may change. The onboarding process was fine and the flight was on time, which to be honest is rare but I was happy. When the snacks and beverage cart came the attendant did not smile, looked unhappy to take our beverage order, handed me and my husband 2 cookies, I then I told her, ""Can we just get pretzels?"" She said ""Then I need the cookies back."" I was honestly appalled."
John of Phoenix, AZ," Feb. 8, 2009","Don't deserve single star. Also, I have a flight from Chicago to Minneapolis 5 hours from now. And they have seats available on the earlier flight but won't give you without charging $75. They are ok to make you wait or fly a flight with empty seats but no customer delight which is no cost to them. No customer driven company and not looking for going extra mile to make customer happy. Never travel on American Airlines again."
Keanu of Las Vegas, NV," Feb. 5, 2009","Worst experience ever with AA never again, they treated my dad like garbage, they humiliated my dad in front of my niece travelling with him and in front of all passengers, just because my dad is ** and not fluent in English. I wish I could sue them for discrimination against my dad for not speaking English fluent instead of offering assistance in Spanish which, the sky harbor airport in Arizona has plenty of bilingual employees. DO NOT FLY AA EVER, pay more with a different airline. The only reason why my dad and niece flew AA to go to my brother's funeral, thank you AA for the worst day ever. It's a shame I have to put a star instead of no stars service."
Kennidavies of Gardner, MA," Feb. 5, 2009","This American Airlines review is out of frustration due to a lot of things. They're a disgrace! The employees are rude, there is no leg room, no entertainment, and treat people like herds of sheep. They have a ""New"" rule where they charge $50 at the gate to carry on your luggage. Are you kidding me? $50 for a carry on? And I can't even use the overhead bin! Disgraceful! Basically these guys are crooks! They're a disgrace. Last time I flew with American their flight was delayed by 2 hours and we ended up missing our connecting flight because it was the last flight out. We ended up having to stay an extra day and had to pay $100 for a hotel. We missed my sisters wedding. On the way back we ended up stuck on the tarmac for 2 hours. Of course!"
Benise of Brooklyn, NY," Feb. 4, 2009","I booked a ticket back when the hurricane were hitting down south every other week. Because of that I was not able to attend my trip in GA. They told me I had up to a year to use my ticket. So when I try to rebook my ticket they are now close to $500. Mind you this is the highest rate out of all the airlines for my particular dates, I asked for a refund because I didn't wanna double what I paid the first time and I was told by the Supervisor (Willie ** in Dallas ) that my only option was to ""use it or lost it"". Being a supervisor myself I thought the tone in which he said it was very careless and he didn't try to help the situation at all. I would never talk to my customers the way he spoke to me especially after losing out on $300!!"
Sam of Portland, OR," Feb. 2, 2009","I just completed a flight on American Airlines. I had read negative reviews, but I found the American Airlines people I had contact with were great, tried to provide all the service they could because our flight had been cancelled due WX and had to layover at ORD. My complaint is the phoney coupon given for a hotel room for a ""discounted rate"". The coupon has nothing to do with American Airlines, but is only a hotel booking service. When I called the phone number provided I was told the only available room was 10 miles away and given a rate of $80.00. It was getting late in the evening so took it. Then was advised there was a $15 service charge to book the room. American Airline paid none of this. The shuttle bus to the hotel was packed (Other delayed passengers). When I got home I checked the hotel rate and found the same room went for $105. I ""saved"" $10. The hotel was a Holiday Inn Express. Room not bad."
W of Nutley, NJ," Feb. 2, 2009","I was en route from San Antonio Texas to Hong Kong and when checking in for the domestic portion of the flight at the ticket counter, the woman claimed there was a problem with my passport. I asked for details and she claimed ""There are spots on your passport."" I told her the passport was still valid and did not expire until the following year."" She made up some baloney about Homeland Security not letting people fly with spots on their passport. I told her I checked their website and there was no mention of anything like that. She then claimed, ""Oh, they don't tell you."" I said, ""Then how are you supposed to know?"" She then sarcastically claimed I needed glasses, so I put my glasses on and told her those so called spots are not a problem. "

While I was away, I heard the news that my dad had passed away. In which, I contacted American Airlines right away and asked if anything can be done. I wanted to fly back before my actual trip date, due to obvious reasons. I even offered to provide them with a death certificate if need be (although, I don't think that is even something they should ask for right away). I spoke to 3 different customer service reps who were all horrible to speak with. They had zero compassion and empathy and just dismissed me as if what I was experiencing was far from a big deal to them. "
Page of Fayetteville, GA," Jan. 27, 2009","I was on the plane for 14 hours due to a delay. Sitting in a broken seat that would not recline. I told the stewardess and she could care less, said nothing she can do. After I got home I contacted the airline and they issued me a fourteen dollar credit. I had paid 197.34 dollars for preferred seats. The worst flight of my life, never again w/ this airline."
Arlene of Los Angeles, CA," Jan. 27, 2009","Overall, (Un)American Airlines continues to disappoint. I really only ever fly with AA as a last resort, and I can't see any reason to recommend traveling with AA. I was prior active duty Army, and now I'm a reservist, and only American Airlines makes me feel like my service is less important now. United, Southwest, Jet Blue, Delta, every other airline doesn't discriminate between Active Duty and Reserve/Guardsmen when it comes to bag fees. So, along with uncomfortable, outdated planes and poor service, I spent a $100 checking bags to and from my destination."
Judy of Marlton, NJ," Jan. 25, 2009",American Airlines is the worst airlines to fly anywhere. They cram you in the seats with no leg room or any room for that matter. I requested a wheelchair at airport and waited 30 minutes upon someone finally arriving. They took me the wrong way to my next check in and I missed my flight. They said I would have to rebook my ticket and just wait for the next flight. Attendant at the gate was very disrespectful and not helpful at all. I had no control over this situation at all. Not to mention when I did finally arrive at my destination that I requested a wheelchair prior to my departure.
Savitri of Tamarac, FL," Jan. 24, 2009","American Airlines is the worst airline in THE WORLD, and should change their name, it is utterly disgraceful that as an American they use this name. Their policy is to not apologize for anything, to be as rude as possible to people who are basically held hostage to them and their BS policies like closing the door to the gate while people are standing there then charging them money to rebook their flight, not caring at all about the bags on their way to a destination without the owners there to pick them up. Then being told when lodging a complaint that it was going in one ear and out the other. I have never been treated so poorly in my life, I will never again fly with this airline, I hope they go bankrupt and get the worst karma life can give. Oh yeah and I get to fly with them tomorrow. :/"
Patricia of Augusta, GA," Jan. 20, 2009","Very disappointed. Unlikely I will ever choose American Airlines again. I didn't make my flight in the spring. I was given a voucher to use for future travel. Now I'm being told I can only use it myself, and not for my family. I don't want to use it for myself. What difference does it make? I'm being told different things by different people. The last guy hung up on me and I wasn't even rude to him. This is how AA does business? All I want is to not be penalized for cancelling a flight that was beyond my control. If you have a voucher it should be flexible to use for anyone. AA is the WORST! Hope they go out of business for this nonsense. Airline travel is a joke."
Denise of Brooklyn, NY," Jan. 19, 2009","American Airlines canceled my 92-year-old father-in-law's flight to Key West due to Hurricane Irma. On that day American Airline was contacted and the representative said there would be no problem re-booking, just use the reference number. American Airlines even went on TV and said they would waive re-booking fees. Today when calling to re-book the flight and after 57 minutes on the phone, I was told the flight could not be re-booked because it was in their notes I requested a refund. At no time did I request a refund and American Airlines could not locate any record of a refund request. Even so, American Airlines still insisted they could not re-book the flight or issue a refund. If we did not have enough trouble dealing with a Cat 4 hurricane and its devastating aftermath, now American Airlines is adding to the misery. All my father-in-law wants is to come to Key West and see that everyone is alright. Thanks, AA."
Pari of Mastic Beach, NY," Jan. 18, 2009",I bought tickets for my mother in law and son to meet my wife and I in Colorado. We had traveled on different airlines due to connections and therefore were going back on different airlines. My wife and I left on our airplane. My mother in law and son were stranded as the plane had a mechanical. This was 8 AM and the bottom line was it didn't get fixed that day. American gave them a 12.00 voucher good in the terminal and did nothing to get them a room as the rooms they usually used weren't available.
Caryl-Sue of Chevy Chase, MD," Jan. 17, 2009","I booked 2 separate flights on American Airlines in Economy since I pay for my air travel. On one they pre-assigned me a back-of-plane middle seat and said that I was required to pay some increased fee for window, aisle or closer to the front. On the second flight they said I have to wait until I reach the boarding gate for any seat. This is ridiculous and unacceptable. The airline has sufficient revenue to - just a suggestion - increase the ""base"" fare to cover a first-come-first-served seat selection and not put everyone into 3rd class or worse status. If they want to surcharge certain premium seats, like middle seats toward the front, that's OK, but this behavior is totally unacceptable and I refuse to fly them (or any airline) that abuses their passengers."
Gloria of Stone Mountain, GA," Jan. 16, 2009",Well I looked into changing my flight for my fiance and I to go home a day earlier... only to discover that American charges $200.00 a ticket PLUS the difference in price tickets!

I have already paid for a flight and now you are trying to rip me off even more!?! Out of touch and terrible service to a customer of over 5 years.

Mathilde of Mons Boubert, FL," Dec. 27, 2008","I was en route from San Antonio Texas to Hong Kong and when checking in for the domestic portion of the flight at the ticket counter, the woman claimed there was a problem with my passport. I asked for details and she claimed ""There are spots on your passport."" I told her the passport was still valid and did not expire until the following year."" She made up some baloney about Homeland Security not letting people fly with spots on their passport. I told her I checked their website and there was no mention of anything like that. She then claimed, ""Oh, they don't tell you."" I said, ""Then how are you supposed to know?"" She then sarcastically claimed I needed glasses, so I put my glasses on and told her those so called spots are not a problem. "

Don of Riverside, CA," Dec. 26, 2008","Where do I even begin? I had a round trip flight booked from Toronto, Ontario to Busan, South Korea back in the month of July (2017). While I was away, I heard the news that my dad had passed away. In which, I contacted American Airlines right away and asked if anything can be done. I wanted to fly back before my actual trip date, due to obvious reasons. I even offered to provide them with a death certificate if need be (although, I don't think that is even something they should ask for right away). I spoke to 3 different customer service reps who were all horrible to speak with. They had zero compassion and empathy and just dismissed me as if what I was experiencing was far from a big deal to them. "
Don of Riverside, CA," Dec. 26, 2008","I was on the plane for 14 hours due to a delay. Sitting in a broken seat that would not recline. I told the stewardess and she could care less, said nothing she can do. After I got home I contacted the airline and they issued me a fourteen dollar credit. I had paid 197.34 dollars for preferred seats. The worst flight of my life, never again w/ this airline."
Rae of Murrieta, CA," Dec. 26, 2008","Overall, (Un)American Airlines continues to disappoint. I really only ever fly with AA as a last resort, and I can't see any reason to recommend traveling with AA. I was prior active duty Army, and now I'm a reservist, and only American Airlines makes me feel like my service is less important now. United, Southwest, Jet Blue, Delta, every other airline doesn't discriminate between Active Duty and Reserve/Guardsmen when it comes to bag fees. So, along with uncomfortable, outdated planes and poor service, I spent a $100 checking bags to and from my destination."
Julie of Horsham, PA," Dec. 23, 2008",American Airlines is the worst airlines to fly anywhere. They cram you in the seats with no leg room or any room for that matter. I requested a wheelchair at airport and waited 30 minutes upon someone finally arriving. They took me the wrong way to my next check in and I missed my flight. They said I would have to rebook my ticket and just wait for the next flight. Attendant at the gate was very disrespectful and not helpful at all. I had no control over this situation at all. Not to mention when I did finally arrive at my destination that I requested a wheelchair prior to my departure.
Siobhan of Carlsbad, CA," Dec. 23, 2008","American Airlines is the worst airline in THE WORLD, and should change their name, it is utterly disgraceful that as an American they use this name. Their policy is to not apologize for anything, to be as rude as possible to people who are basically held hostage to them and their BS policies like closing the door to the gate while people are standing there then charging them money to rebook their flight, not caring at all about the bags on their way to a destination without the owners there to pick them up. Then being told when lodging a complaint that it was going in one ear and out the other. I have never been treated so poorly in my life, I will never again fly with this airline, I hope they go bankrupt and get the worst karma life can give. Oh yeah and I get to fly with them tomorrow. :/"
Stephen of Jenkintown, PA," Dec. 22, 2008","Very disappointed. Unlikely I will ever choose American Airlines again. I didn't make my flight in the spring. I was given a voucher to use for future travel. Now I'm being told I can only use it myself, and not for my family. I don't want to use it for myself. What difference does it make? I'm being told different things by different people. The last guy hung up on me and I wasn't even rude to him. This is how AA does business? All I want is to not be penalized for cancelling a flight that was beyond my control. If you have a voucher it should be flexible to use for anyone. AA is the WORST! Hope they go out of business for this nonsense. Airline travel is a joke."
Humberto of Olathe, KS," Dec. 20, 2008","American Airlines canceled my 92-year-old father-in-law's flight to Key West due to Hurricane Irma. On that day American Airline was contacted and the representative said there would be no problem re-booking, just use the reference number. American Airlines even went on TV and said they would waive re-booking fees. Today when calling to re-book the flight and after 57 minutes on the phone, I was told the flight could not be re-booked because it was in their notes I requested a refund. At no time did I request a refund and American Airlines could not locate any record of a refund request. Even so, American Airlines still insisted they could not re-book the flight or issue a refund. If we did not have enough trouble dealing with a Cat 4 hurricane and its devastating aftermath, now American Airlines is adding to the misery. All my father-in-law wants is to come to Key West and see that everyone is alright. Thanks, AA."
Lena of Tolland, CT," Dec. 18, 2008",I bought tickets for my mother in law and son to meet my wife and I in Colorado. We had traveled on different airlines due to connections and therefore were going back on different airlines. My wife and I left on our airplane. My mother in law and son were stranded as the plane had a mechanical. This was 8 AM and the bottom line was it didn't get fixed that day. American gave them a 12.00 voucher good in the terminal and did nothing to get them a room as the rooms they usually used weren't available.
Stacie of Colorado Springs, CO," Dec. 10, 2008","I booked 2 separate flights on American Airlines in Economy since I pay for my air travel. On one they pre-assigned me a back-of-plane middle seat and said that I was required to pay some increased fee for window, aisle or closer to the front. On the second flight they said I have to wait until I reach the boarding gate for any seat. This is ridiculous and unacceptable. The airline has sufficient revenue to - just a suggestion - increase the ""base"" fare to cover a first-come-first-served seat selection and not put everyone into 3rd class or worse status. If they want to surcharge certain premium seats, like middle seats toward the front, that's OK, but this behavior is totally unacceptable and I refuse to fly them (or any airline) that abuses their passengers."
Elizabeth of North Miami, FL," Dec. 9, 2008",Well I looked into changing my flight for my fiance and I to go home a day earlier... only to discover that American charges $200.00 a ticket PLUS the difference in price tickets! LIKE THAT IS GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE! So for the price of another ticket I can change my flight! I will be looking elsewhere for flights in the future. I have already paid for a flight and now you are trying to rip me off even more!?! Out of touch and terrible service to a customer of over 5 years. I will be going elsewhere where I don't get bent over the table. Thank you American!
Hilary of Oranjestad, AL," Dec. 9, 2008","I originally booked my flight to Miami from Washington, DC back in July 2017. I was scheduled to fly September 13-18, 2017. I, like many, had to cancel my trip because of hurricane Irma. I was informed by two customer service representatives that I would be able to rebook my flight to Miami with no additional charges in fare and no change fees. Of course, when it comes time to book my flight, I'm informed about a change fee. I told the agent, I was reassured twice that I would not be charged any additional fees because my initial cancellation was weather related. "
Gretchen of San Diego, CA," Dec. 8, 2008","American Airlines is full of **. Our cruise was cancelled due to Hurricane Irma. It was beyond our control and the airline stated there was nothing that they could do. No partial credit, changes or anything! I will not be flying with them anymore!"
Kerry of Phoenix, AZ," Dec. 8, 2008",My husband and I were scheduled to fly out at 7:15 am to go to California for a very important family matter. We do not live near the airport so we were up early to make sure we were early and nothing could go wrong. But things did go wrong. When we got to the airport we went and printed out tickets at the self checkout. We did notice that it mentioned no overhead storage for our carry on bags. So confused because we fly a lot and there is always overhead storage or they place in under the cabin. So we asked a lady that was standing in the area of self print and she looked and our tickets said we would be fine... Again we were told wrong.
Christina of Coquitlam, BC," Dec. 5, 2008","On September 4 my family of 5 arrived at the airport in Anchorage to fly home to Toronto via Dallas. Four of us had carry-on sized luggage but one had a mid-sized suitcase that we knew we would have to check. Our flight to Toronto included a 12.5-hour connection at DFW (not by choice). Since none of us sleep well on planes, we were considering going to a hotel following the overnight flight to DFW. When checking the suitcase, I specifically asked the American Airlines agent ""if we only check this bag to DFW and then go to a hotel for a few hours of sleep, will we be charged a second baggage fee to check the bag in for the flight to Toronto? If so we can rearrange the bags so that we can just check it through to Toronto."" "
Asad of Simi Valley, CA," Dec. 2, 2008","I purchased the basic economy ticket. When I was getting ready to board in Charlotte, the attendant mentioned that this was a new program for your airline and that customers have stated it was cost effective. However, this was not my case! I paid nearly $600 to fly from Columbus, OH to Asheville, NC. Absolutely absurd!!! In the future, I will do all I can to avoid flying with your airline and don't count on a positive recommendation from me to others! Also, stop charging for the first piece of checked in luggage!"

I called at night again because I was worried I saw it was still cancel. After almost 2 hours they answered the phone. I told them what happened. They told me that they were very sorry but the flight was canceled and they didnt' have flight for Sept 12. They gave me 1 stop flight for Sept 13. "
Paula of Dracut, MA," Dec. 1, 2008","I was scheduled to fly out of Tampa International on Sunday, September, 17th to Durango, CO. I live in Sarasota, and just returned home the other day after evacuating for Hurricane Irma. I fled Florida and headed to Georgia, where I had to rent a hotel for a few nights. When I returned home I was fortunate enough not to have suffered damage. I of course have yard debris strewn about and I am still without power. The power company has estimated by the end of the day on September 22nd I will have power. With the extra costs incurred from having to leave my home, and the loss of power, I decided this was not a good time to travel."
Bridgette of Cowpens, SC," Dec. 1, 2008","Hurricane Irma was mess for AA. I get it. I'm sure there were thousands who were stuck trying to get their flights changed. Unfortunately, I was in Costa Rica with a connection via Miami and I got, as the AA agent said ""the short end of the stick."" I would be stuck almost another week in Costa Rica as everything AA had was booked out or cancelled. I saw a little bit of silver lining when I found that if I could get to Mexico city, I could fly home via DFW. However, AA would not change the ticket as it is against their rules to change the country of origin on a ticket. ""We cannot do it."" However, a more accurate description is ""will not."""
Bill of Richardson, TX," Dec. 1, 2008","We were delayed on our AA out of Seattle due to having to wait on flight crew. Managed to make it to Dallas on time BUT had to sit on the tarmac for 20 mins waiting for a gait in order to deplane. This caused to miss our connecting flight. Next available flight is the next day. Asked about compensation for overnight hotel stay (there are 7 in our party, including a 3 year old) and were denied due to the delay being coded as weather related, which is absolutely bogus. So livid, frustrated, and tired at this point. Also found out AA has no number to call for complaints... You have to go through email so who knows if they will even read it or reply. Will never fly AA again if I can help it."
Michelle of Killeen, TX," Dec. 1, 2008","I was on an almost 2 hour flight (Flight AA3936) stuck sitting with one leg over my bag and the other on the edge of the aisle. Not once was I asked to check in my bag nor told it wouldn't fit on the overhead bin. By the time we landed my knees, hips and back were killing me and I had to have help from the gentleman next to me to be able to stand up. So glad there wasn't an emergency 'cause this would have been one hell of a hazard. Lesson learned not to use this airline again."
Crystal of Cupertino, CA," Nov. 30, 2008","American Airlines‰Û_the new standard for horrible service. Oh‰Û_I mean HORRIBLE! I travel very frequently for work and have stuck to one specific airline in order to build my status with them (ie. first class upgrades often, better seat choices, free checked bags). Recently, service has taken a turn for the worse. I‰Ûªm a reasonable guy and tolerate more than most. Call it my Southern hospitality, my upbringing or my service to the community when I served in law enforcement, but I just plain put up with more‰Û_until now."
Steven of Cave Creek, AZ," Nov. 29, 2008","I travel 80%~ for Work and have flown with almost every airline multiple times. AA is by far the worst. Not due to their customer service/staff/delays or anything like that (at least that I‰Ûªve noticed), but their planes have no entertainment system on each seat, they do not play movies on the overhead screens, and they don‰Ûªt even have a free WiFi movie/tv option you can connect to using your phone! I‰Ûªm currently on a flight from Boston to Phoenix and was utterly shocked when I sat in my seat and noticed no form of entertainment for a cross-country flight. Delta and other airlines provide personal entertainment screens on each screen or a smartphone connect feature for 2+ hr flights, which in turn make the flights more enjoyable. Anyways, to avoid rambling on and on about the lack of technology on AA planes I‰Ûªll just say if you enjoyed traveling in the late 90s early 2000s, then AA is for you. If you want to travel in 2017 and beyond, find a different airline."
Edward of Riverdale, IL," Nov. 28, 2008","I had a horrible experience today on my flight back to Miami. I have been an AAdvantage member for many years now and have always chosen to be loyal to American but after today's experience that may change. The onboarding process was fine and the flight was on time, which to be honest is rare but I was happy. When the snacks and beverage cart came the attendant did not smile, looked unhappy to take our beverage order, handed me and my husband 2 cookies, I then I told her, ""Can we just get pretzels?"" She said ""Then I need the cookies back."" I was honestly appalled."
Kenneth of San Diego, CA," Nov. 25, 2008","Don't deserve single star. Also, I have a flight from Chicago to Minneapolis 5 hours from now. And they have seats available on the earlier flight but won't give you without charging $75. They are ok to make you wait or fly a flight with empty seats but no customer delight which is no cost to them. No customer driven company and not looking for going extra mile to make customer happy. Never travel on American Airlines again."
Emily of Apo, OTHER," Nov. 17, 2008","Worst experience ever with AA never again, they treated my dad like garbage, they humiliated my dad in front of my niece travelling with him and in front of all passengers, just because my dad is ** and not fluent in English. I wish I could sue them for discrimination against my dad for not speaking English fluent instead of offering assistance in Spanish which, the sky harbor airport in Arizona has plenty of bilingual employees. DO NOT FLY AA EVER, pay more with a different airline. The only reason why my dad and niece flew AA to go to my brother's funeral, thank you AA for the worst day ever. It's a shame I have to put a star instead of no stars service."
Paul of Runcorn, OTHER," Nov. 14, 2008","This American Airlines review is out of frustration due to a lot of things. They're a disgrace! The employees are rude, there is no leg room, no entertainment, and treat people like herds of sheep. They have a ""New"" rule where they charge $50 at the gate to carry on your luggage. Are you kidding me? $50 for a carry on? And I can't even use the overhead bin! Disgraceful! Basically these guys are crooks! They're a disgrace. Last time I flew with American their flight was delayed by 2 hours and we ended up missing our connecting flight because it was the last flight out. We ended up having to stay an extra day and had to pay $100 for a hotel. We missed my sisters wedding. On the way back we ended up stuck on the tarmac for 2 hours. Of course!"
Lynne of Bakersfield, CA," Nov. 14, 2008","I booked a ticket back when the hurricane were hitting down south every other week. Because of that I was not able to attend my trip in GA. They told me I had up to a year to use my ticket. So when I try to rebook my ticket they are now close to $500. Mind you this is the highest rate out of all the airlines for my particular dates, I asked for a refund because I didn't wanna double what I paid the first time and I was told by the Supervisor (Willie ** in Dallas ) that my only option was to ""use it or lost it"". Being a supervisor myself I thought the tone in which he said it was very careless and he didn't try to help the situation at all. I would never talk to my customers the way he spoke to me especially after losing out on $300!!"
Christina of Phoenix, AZ," Nov. 12, 2008","I just completed a flight on American Airlines. I had read negative reviews, but I found the American Airlines people I had contact with were great, tried to provide all the service they could because our flight had been cancelled due WX and had to layover at ORD. My complaint is the phoney coupon given for a hotel room for a ""discounted rate"". The coupon has nothing to do with American Airlines, but is only a hotel booking service. When I called the phone number provided I was told the only available room was 10 miles away and given a rate of $80.00. It was getting late in the evening so took it. Then was advised there was a $15 service charge to book the room. American Airline paid none of this. The shuttle bus to the hotel was packed (Other delayed passengers).

I live in Sarasota, and just returned home the other day after evacuating for Hurricane Irma. I fled Florida and headed to Georgia, where I had to rent a hotel for a few nights. When I returned home I was fortunate enough not to have suffered damage. I of course have yard debris strewn about and I am still without power. The power company has estimated by the end of the day on September 22nd I will have power. With the extra costs incurred from having to leave my home, and the loss of power, I decided this was not a good time to travel."
Shabeba of Fayetteville, GA," Oct. 2, 2008","Hurricane Irma was mess for AA. I get it. I'm sure there were thousands who were stuck trying to get their flights changed. Unfortunately, I was in Costa Rica with a connection via Miami and I got, as the AA agent said ""the short end of the stick."" I would be stuck almost another week in Costa Rica as everything AA had was booked out or cancelled. I saw a little bit of silver lining when I found that if I could get to Mexico city, I could fly home via DFW. However, AA would not change the ticket as it is against their rules to change the country of origin on a ticket. ""We cannot do it."" However, a more accurate description is ""will not."""
Carla of Van Nuys, CA," Sept. 30, 2008","We were delayed on our AA out of Seattle due to having to wait on flight crew. Managed to make it to Dallas on time BUT had to sit on the tarmac for 20 mins waiting for a gait in order to deplane. This caused to miss our connecting flight. Next available flight is the next day. Asked about compensation for overnight hotel stay (there are 7 in our party, including a 3 year old) and were denied due to the delay being coded as weather related, which is absolutely bogus. So livid, frustrated, and tired at this point. Also found out AA has no number to call for complaints... You have to go through email so who knows if they will even read it or reply. Will never fly AA again if I can help it."
Angela of Maricopa, AZ," Sept. 30, 2008","I was on an almost 2 hour flight (Flight AA3936) stuck sitting with one leg over my bag and the other on the edge of the aisle. Not once was I asked to check in my bag nor told it wouldn't fit on the overhead bin. By the time we landed my knees, hips and back were killing me and I had to have help from the gentleman next to me to be able to stand up. So glad there wasn't an emergency 'cause this would have been one hell of a hazard. Lesson learned not to use this airline again."
Carol of Pensacola, FL," Sept. 30, 2008","American Airlines‰Û_the new standard for horrible service. Oh‰Û_I mean HORRIBLE! I travel very frequently for work and have stuck to one specific airline in order to build my status with them (ie. first class upgrades often, better seat choices, free checked bags). Recently, service has taken a turn for the worse. I‰Ûªm a reasonable guy and tolerate more than most. Call it my Southern hospitality, my upbringing or my service to the community when I served in law enforcement, but I just plain put up with more‰Û_until now."
Kim of Des Moines, IA," Sept. 28, 2008","I travel 80%~ for Work and have flown with almost every airline multiple times. AA is by far the worst. Not due to their customer service/staff/delays or anything like that (at least that I‰Ûªve noticed), but their planes have no entertainment system on each seat, they do not play movies on the overhead screens, and they don‰Ûªt even have a free WiFi movie/tv option you can connect to using your phone! I‰Ûªm currently on a flight from Boston to Phoenix and was utterly shocked when I sat in my seat and noticed no form of entertainment for a cross-country flight. Delta and other airlines provide personal entertainment screens on each screen or a smartphone connect feature for 2+ hr flights, which in turn make the flights more enjoyable. Anyways, to avoid rambling on and on about the lack of technology on AA planes I‰Ûªll just say if you enjoyed traveling in the late 90s early 2000s, then AA is for you. If you want to travel in 2017 and beyond, find a different airline."
Harold of Columbia, SC," Sept. 24, 2008","I had a horrible experience today on my flight back to Miami. I have been an AAdvantage member for many years now and have always chosen to be loyal to American but after today's experience that may change. The onboarding process was fine and the flight was on time, which to be honest is rare but I was happy. When the snacks and beverage cart came the attendant did not smile, looked unhappy to take our beverage order, handed me and my husband 2 cookies, I then I told her, ""Can we just get pretzels?"" She said ""Then I need the cookies back."" I was honestly appalled."
Greg of Saulsbury, TN," Sept. 24, 2008","Don't deserve single star. Also, I have a flight from Chicago to Minneapolis 5 hours from now. And they have seats available on the earlier flight but won't give you without charging $75. They are ok to make you wait or fly a flight with empty seats but no customer delight which is no cost to them. No customer driven company and not looking for going extra mile to make customer happy. Never travel on American Airlines again."
Penny of Dallas, TX," Sept. 24, 2008","Worst experience ever with AA never again, they treated my dad like garbage, they humiliated my dad in front of my niece travelling with him and in front of all passengers, just because my dad is ** and not fluent in English. I wish I could sue them for discrimination against my dad for not speaking English fluent instead of offering assistance in Spanish which, the sky harbor airport in Arizona has plenty of bilingual employees. DO NOT FLY AA EVER, pay more with a different airline. The only reason why my dad and niece flew AA to go to my brother's funeral, thank you AA for the worst day ever. It's a shame I have to put a star instead of no stars service."
Tina of Philadelphia, PA," Sept. 22, 2008","This American Airlines review is out of frustration due to a lot of things. They're a disgrace! The employees are rude, there is no leg room, no entertainment, and treat people like herds of sheep. They have a ""New"" rule where they charge $50 at the gate to carry on your luggage. Are you kidding me? $50 for a carry on? And I can't even use the overhead bin! Disgraceful! Basically these guys are crooks! They're a disgrace. Last time I flew with American their flight was delayed by 2 hours and we ended up missing our connecting flight because it was the last flight out. We ended up having to stay an extra day and had to pay $100 for a hotel. We missed my sisters wedding. On the way back we ended up stuck on the tarmac for 2 hours. Of course!"
Miriam of Lake Havasu City, AZ," Sept. 21, 2008","I booked a ticket back when the hurricane were hitting down south every other week. Because of that I was not able to attend my trip in GA. They told me I had up to a year to use my ticket. So when I try to rebook my ticket they are now close to $500. Mind you this is the highest rate out of all the airlines for my particular dates, I asked for a refund because I didn't wanna double what I paid the first time and I was told by the Supervisor (Willie ** in Dallas ) that my only option was to ""use it or lost it"". Being a supervisor myself I thought the tone in which he said it was very careless and he didn't try to help the situation at all. I would never talk to my customers the way he spoke to me especially after losing out on $300!!"
Gwynne of Lewisburg, PA," Sept. 21, 2008","I just completed a flight on American Airlines. I had read negative reviews, but I found the American Airlines people I had contact with were great, tried to provide all the service they could because our flight had been cancelled due WX and had to layover at ORD. My complaint is the phoney coupon given for a hotel room for a ""discounted rate"". The coupon has nothing to do with American Airlines, but is only a hotel booking service. When I called the phone number provided I was told the only available room was 10 miles away and given a rate of $80.00. It was getting late in the evening so took it. Then was advised there was a $15 service charge to book the room. American Airline paid none of this. The shuttle bus to the hotel was packed (Other delayed passengers). When I got home I checked the hotel rate and found the same room went for $105. I ""saved"" $10. The hotel was a Holiday Inn Express. Room not bad."
Alice of Pacifica, CA," Sept. 19, 2008","I was en route from San Antonio Texas to Hong Kong and when checking in for the domestic portion of the flight at the ticket counter, the woman claimed there was a problem with my passport.

She made up some baloney about Homeland Security not letting people fly with spots on their passport. I told her I checked their website and there was no mention of anything like that. She then claimed, ""Oh, they don't tell you."" I said, ""Then how are you supposed to know?""

Shawn of Henderson, NV," Sept. 10, 2008","Where do I even begin? I had a round trip flight booked from Toronto, Ontario to Busan, South Korea back in the month of July (2017). While I was away, I heard the news that my dad had passed away. In which, I contacted American Airlines right away and asked if anything can be done. I wanted to fly back before my actual trip date, due to obvious reasons. I even offered to provide them with a death certificate if need be (although, I don't think that is even something they should ask for right away). I spoke to 3 different customer service reps who were all horrible to speak with. They had zero compassion and empathy and just dismissed me as if what I was experiencing was far from a big deal to them. "
Jerry of Springfield, MO," Sept. 8, 2008","I was on the plane for 14 hours due to a delay. Sitting in a broken seat that would not recline. I told the stewardess and she could care less, said nothing she can do. After I got home I contacted the airline and they issued me a fourteen dollar credit. I had paid 197.34 dollars for preferred seats. The worst flight of my life, never again w/ this airline."
Curt of Georgetown, TX," Sept. 7, 2008","Overall, (Un)American Airlines continues to disappoint. I really only ever fly with AA as a last resort, and I can't see any reason to recommend traveling with AA. I was prior active duty Army, and now I'm a reservist, and only American Airlines makes me feel like my service is less important now. United, Southwest, Jet Blue, Delta, every other airline doesn't discriminate between Active Duty and Reserve/Guardsmen when it comes to bag fees. So, along with uncomfortable, outdated planes and poor service, I spent a $100 checking bags to and from my destination."
Marcy of Wallkill, NY," Sept. 6, 2008",American Airlines is the worst airlines to fly anywhere. They cram you in the seats with no leg room or any room for that matter. I requested a wheelchair at airport and waited 30 minutes upon someone finally arriving. They took me the wrong way to my next check in and I missed my flight. They said I would have to rebook my ticket and just wait for the next flight. Attendant at the gate was very disrespectful and not helpful at all. I had no control over this situation at all. Not to mention when I did finally arrive at my destination that I requested a wheelchair prior to my departure.
Bill of Lake Forest, CA," Sept. 5, 2008","American Airlines is the worst airline in THE WORLD, and should change their name, it is utterly disgraceful that as an American they use this name. Their policy is to not apologize for anything, to be as rude as possible to people who are basically held hostage to them and their BS policies like closing the door to the gate while people are standing there then charging them money to rebook their flight, not caring at all about the bags on their way to a destination without the owners there to pick them up. Then being told when lodging a complaint that it was going in one ear and out the other. I have never been treated so poorly in my life, I will never again fly with this airline, I hope they go bankrupt and get the worst karma life can give. Oh yeah and I get to fly with them tomorrow. :/"
Janet of Richmond, VA," Sept. 5, 2008","Very disappointed. Unlikely I will ever choose American Airlines again. I didn't make my flight in the spring. I was given a voucher to use for future travel. Now I'm being told I can only use it myself, and not for my family. I don't want to use it for myself. What difference does it make? I'm being told different things by different people. The last guy hung up on me and I wasn't even rude to him. This is how AA does business? All I want is to not be penalized for cancelling a flight that was beyond my control. If you have a voucher it should be flexible to use for anyone. AA is the WORST! Hope they go out of business for this nonsense. Airline travel is a joke."
Steven of Scottsdale, AZ," Sept. 4, 2008","American Airlines canceled my 92-year-old father-in-law's flight to Key West due to Hurricane Irma. On that day American Airline was contacted and the representative said there would be no problem re-booking, just use the reference number. American Airlines even went on TV and said they would waive re-booking fees. Today when calling to re-book the flight and after 57 minutes on the phone, I was told the flight could not be re-booked because it was in their notes I requested a refund. At no time did I request a refund and American Airlines could not locate any record of a refund request. Even so, American Airlines still insisted they could not re-book the flight or issue a refund. If we did not have enough trouble dealing with a Cat 4 hurricane and its devastating aftermath, now American Airlines is adding to the misery. All my father-in-law wants is to come to Key West and see that everyone is alright. Thanks, AA."
Otis of Wadley, AL," Sept. 3, 2008",I bought tickets for my mother in law and son to meet my wife and I in Colorado. We had traveled on different airlines due to connections and therefore were going back on different airlines. My wife and I left on our airplane. My mother in law and son were stranded as the plane had a mechanical. This was 8 AM and the bottom line was it didn't get fixed that day. American gave them a 12.00 voucher good in the terminal and did nothing to get them a room as the rooms they usually used weren't available.
Annie of Bartlesville, OK," Sept. 2, 2008","I booked 2 separate flights on American Airlines in Economy since I pay for my air travel. On one they pre-assigned me a back-of-plane middle seat and said that I was required to pay some increased fee for window, aisle or closer to the front. On the second flight they said I have to wait until I reach the boarding gate for any seat. This is ridiculous and unacceptable. The airline has sufficient revenue to - just a suggestion - increase the ""base"" fare to cover a first-come-first-served seat selection and not put everyone into 3rd class or worse status. If they want to surcharge certain premium seats, like middle seats toward the front, that's OK, but this behavior is totally unacceptable and I refuse to fly them (or any airline) that abuses their passengers."
Rob of Campbell, CA," Sept. 2, 2008",Well I looked into changing my flight for my fiance and I to go home a day earlier... only to discover that American charges $200.00 a ticket PLUS the difference in price tickets! LIKE THAT IS GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE! So for the price of another ticket I can change my flight! I will be looking elsewhere for flights in the future. I have already paid for a flight and now you are trying to rip me off even more!?! Out of touch and terrible service to a customer of over 5 years. I will be going elsewhere where I don't get bent over the table. Thank you American!
Chad of Jersey City, NJ," Aug. 31, 2008","I originally booked my flight to Miami from Washington, DC back in July 2017. I was scheduled to fly September 13-18, 2017. I, like many, had to cancel my trip because of hurricane Irma. I was informed by two customer service representatives that I would be able to rebook my flight to Miami with no additional charges in fare and no change fees. Of course, when it comes time to book my flight, I'm informed about a change fee. I told the agent, I was reassured twice that I would not be charged any additional fees because my initial cancellation was weather related. "
Bill of Charleston, SC," Aug. 30, 2008","American Airlines is full of **. Our cruise was cancelled due to Hurricane Irma. It was beyond our control and the airline stated there was nothing that they could do. No partial credit, changes or anything! I will not be flying with them anymore!"
Ramona of Indianapolis, IN," Aug. 28, 2008",My husband and I were scheduled to fly out at 7:15 am to go to California for a very important family matter. We do not live near the airport so we were up early to make sure we were early and nothing could go wrong. But things did go wrong. When we got to the airport we went and printed out tickets at the self checkout. We did notice that it mentioned no overhead storage for our carry on bags. So confused because we fly a lot and there is always overhead storage or they place in under the cabin. So we asked a lady that was standing in the area of self print and she looked and our tickets said we would be fine... Again we were told wrong.
Debbie of Orlando, FL," Aug. 28, 2008","On September 4 my family of 5 arrived at the airport in Anchorage to fly home to Toronto via Dallas. Four of us had carry-on sized luggage but one had a mid-sized suitcase that we knew we would have to check. Our flight to Toronto included a 12.5-hour connection at DFW (not by choice). Since none of us sleep well on planes, we were considering going to a hotel following the overnight flight to DFW. When checking the suitcase, I specifically asked the American Airlines agent ""if we only check this bag to DFW and then go to a hotel for a few hours of sleep, will we be charged a second baggage fee to check the bag in for the flight to Toronto? If so we can rearrange the bags so that we can just check it through to Toronto."" "
Arinbjorn of Carmel, CA," Aug. 27, 2008","I purchased the basic economy ticket. When I was getting ready to board in Charlotte, the attendant mentioned that this was a new program for your airline and that customers have stated it was cost effective. However, this was not my case! I paid nearly $600 to fly from Columbus, OH to Asheville, NC. Absolutely absurd!!! In the future, I will do all I can to avoid flying with your airline and don't count on a positive recommendation from me to others! Also, stop charging for the first piece of checked in luggage!"

They said I would have to rebook my ticket and just wait for the next flight. Attendant at the gate was very disrespectful and not helpful at all. I had no control over this situation at all. Not to mention when I did finally arrive at my destination that I requested a wheelchair prior to my departure.
Marie of Toney, AL," Aug. 8, 2008","American Airlines is the worst airline in THE WORLD, and should change their name, it is utterly disgraceful that as an American they use this name. Their policy is to not apologize for anything, to be as rude as possible to people who are basically held hostage to them and their BS policies like closing the door to the gate while people are standing there then charging them money to rebook their flight, not caring at all about the bags on their way to a destination without the owners there to pick them up. Then being told when lodging a complaint that it was going in one ear and out the other. I have never been treated so poorly in my life, I will never again fly with this airline, I hope they go bankrupt and get the worst karma life can give. Oh yeah and I get to fly with them tomorrow. :/"
Adrian of London, AL," Aug. 5, 2008","Very disappointed. Unlikely I will ever choose American Airlines again. I didn't make my flight in the spring. I was given a voucher to use for future travel. Now I'm being told I can only use it myself, and not for my family. I don't want to use it for myself. What difference does it make? I'm being told different things by different people. The last guy hung up on me and I wasn't even rude to him. This is how AA does business? All I want is to not be penalized for cancelling a flight that was beyond my control. If you have a voucher it should be flexible to use for anyone. AA is the WORST! Hope they go out of business for this nonsense. Airline travel is a joke."
Bob of Portland, OR," Aug. 5, 2008","American Airlines canceled my 92-year-old father-in-law's flight to Key West due to Hurricane Irma. On that day American Airline was contacted and the representative said there would be no problem re-booking, just use the reference number. American Airlines even went on TV and said they would waive re-booking fees. Today when calling to re-book the flight and after 57 minutes on the phone, I was told the flight could not be re-booked because it was in their notes I requested a refund. At no time did I request a refund and American Airlines could not locate any record of a refund request. Even so, American Airlines still insisted they could not re-book the flight or issue a refund. If we did not have enough trouble dealing with a Cat 4 hurricane and its devastating aftermath, now American Airlines is adding to the misery. All my father-in-law wants is to come to Key West and see that everyone is alright. Thanks, AA."
Kin of Kansas City, MO," Aug. 1, 2008",I bought tickets for my mother in law and son to meet my wife and I in Colorado. We had traveled on different airlines due to connections and therefore were going back on different airlines. My wife and I left on our airplane. My mother in law and son were stranded as the plane had a mechanical. This was 8 AM and the bottom line was it didn't get fixed that day. American gave them a 12.00 voucher good in the terminal and did nothing to get them a room as the rooms they usually used weren't available.
Jojo of Greensboro, NC," Aug. 1, 2008","I booked 2 separate flights on American Airlines in Economy since I pay for my air travel. On one they pre-assigned me a back-of-plane middle seat and said that I was required to pay some increased fee for window, aisle or closer to the front. On the second flight they said I have to wait until I reach the boarding gate for any seat. This is ridiculous and unacceptable. The airline has sufficient revenue to - just a suggestion - increase the ""base"" fare to cover a first-come-first-served seat selection and not put everyone into 3rd class or worse status. If they want to surcharge certain premium seats, like middle seats toward the front, that's OK, but this behavior is totally unacceptable and I refuse to fly them (or any airline) that abuses their passengers."
Richard of Plymouth Meeting, PA," Aug. 1, 2008",Well I looked into changing my flight for my fiance and I to go home a day earlier... only to discover that American charges $200.00 a ticket PLUS the difference in price tickets! LIKE THAT IS GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE! So for the price of another ticket I can change my flight! I will be looking elsewhere for flights in the future. I have already paid for a flight and now you are trying to rip me off even more!?! Out of touch and terrible service to a customer of over 5 years. I will be going elsewhere where I don't get bent over the table. Thank you American!
Alexander of New York, NY," Aug. 1, 2008","I originally booked my flight to Miami from Washington, DC back in July 2017. I was scheduled to fly September 13-18, 2017. I, like many, had to cancel my trip because of hurricane Irma. I was informed by two customer service representatives that I would be able to rebook my flight to Miami with no additional charges in fare and no change fees. Of course, when it comes time to book my flight, I'm informed about a change fee. I told the agent, I was reassured twice that I would not be charged any additional fees because my initial cancellation was weather related. "
Star of Keller, TX," July 28, 2008","American Airlines is full of **. Our cruise was cancelled due to Hurricane Irma. It was beyond our control and the airline stated there was nothing that they could do. No partial credit, changes or anything! I will not be flying with them anymore!"
Lynisha of Los Angeles, CA," July 28, 2008",My husband and I were scheduled to fly out at 7:15 am to go to California for a very important family matter. We do not live near the airport so we were up early to make sure we were early and nothing could go wrong. But things did go wrong. When we got to the airport we went and printed out tickets at the self checkout. We did notice that it mentioned no overhead storage for our carry on bags. So confused because we fly a lot and there is always overhead storage or they place in under the cabin. So we asked a lady that was standing in the area of self print and she looked and our tickets said we would be fine... Again we were told wrong.
Selene of Los Angeles, CA," July 28, 2008","On September 4 my family of 5 arrived at the airport in Anchorage to fly home to Toronto via Dallas. Four of us had carry-on sized luggage but one had a mid-sized suitcase that we knew we would have to check. Our flight to Toronto included a 12.5-hour connection at DFW (not by choice). Since none of us sleep well on planes, we were considering going to a hotel following the overnight flight to DFW. When checking the suitcase, I specifically asked the American Airlines agent ""if we only check this bag to DFW and then go to a hotel for a few hours of sleep, will we be charged a second baggage fee to check the bag in for the flight to Toronto? If so we can rearrange the bags so that we can just check it through to Toronto."" "
Carolee of Alexandria, VA," July 26, 2008","I purchased the basic economy ticket. When I was getting ready to board in Charlotte, the attendant mentioned that this was a new program for your airline and that customers have stated it was cost effective. However, this was not my case! I paid nearly $600 to fly from Columbus, OH to Asheville, NC. Absolutely absurd!!! In the future, I will do all I can to avoid flying with your airline and don't count on a positive recommendation from me to others! Also, stop charging for the first piece of checked in luggage!"
Willy of Vernon, CT," July 25, 2008","I did a reservation with AA Sept 10, 2017 over the phone to Miami for Sept 12, 2017 in the flight # 1399. September 11 I checked the flight online and it was canceled. I called customer service. Patricia told me that I was wrong it wasn't cancel. I called at night again because I was worried I saw it was still cancel. After almost 2 hours they answered the phone. I told them what happened. They told me that they were very sorry but the flight was canceled and they didnt' have flight for Sept 12. They gave me 1 stop flight for Sept 13. "
Angela of Portland, OR," July 24, 2008","I was scheduled to fly out of Tampa International on Sunday, September, 17th to Durango, CO. I live in Sarasota, and just returned home the other day after evacuating for Hurricane Irma. I fled Florida and headed to Georgia, where I had to rent a hotel for a few nights. When I returned home I was fortunate enough not to have suffered damage. I of course have yard debris strewn about and I am still without power. The power company has estimated by the end of the day on September 22nd I will have power. With the extra costs incurred from having to leave my home, and the loss of power, I decided this was not a good time to travel."
Traci of Clovis, CA," July 24, 2008","Hurricane Irma was mess for AA. I get it. I'm sure there were thousands who were stuck trying to get their flights changed. Unfortunately, I was in Costa Rica with a connection via Miami and I got, as the AA agent said ""the short end of the stick."" I would be stuck almost another week in Costa Rica as everything AA had was booked out or cancelled. I saw a little bit of silver lining when I found that if I could get to Mexico city, I could fly home via DFW. However, AA would not change the ticket as it is against their rules to change the country of origin on a ticket. ""We cannot do it."" However, a more accurate description is ""will not."""
F of San Antonio, TX," July 23, 2008","We were delayed on our AA out of Seattle due to having to wait on flight crew. Managed to make it to Dallas on time BUT had to sit on the tarmac for 20 mins waiting for a gait in order to deplane. This caused to miss our connecting flight. Next available flight is the next day. Asked about compensation for overnight hotel stay (there are 7 in our party, including a 3 year old) and were denied due to the delay being coded as weather related, which is absolutely bogus. So livid, frustrated, and tired at this point. Also found out AA has no number to call for complaints... You have to go through email so who knows if they will even read it or reply. Will never fly AA again if I can help it."
Janine of Palm City, FL," July 23, 2008","I was on an almost 2 hour flight (Flight AA3936) stuck sitting with one leg over my bag and the other on the edge of the aisle. Not once was I asked to check in my bag nor told it wouldn't fit on the overhead bin. By the time we landed my knees, hips and back were killing me and I had to have help from the gentleman next to me to be able to stand up. So glad there wasn't an emergency 'cause this would have been one hell of a hazard. Lesson learned not to use this airline again."
Al of San Jose, CA," July 20, 2008","American Airlines‰Û_the new standard for horrible service. Oh‰Û_I mean HORRIBLE! I travel very frequently for work and have stuck to one specific airline in order to build my status with them (ie. first class upgrades often, better seat choices, free checked bags). Recently, service has taken a turn for the worse. I‰Ûªm a reasonable guy and tolerate more than most. Call it my Southern hospitality, my upbringing or my service to the community when I served in law enforcement, but I just plain put up with more‰Û_until now."
Fahm of San Francisco, CA," July 18, 2008","I travel 80%~ for Work and have flown with almost every airline multiple times. AA is by far the worst. Not due to their customer service/staff/delays or anything like that (at least that I‰Ûªve noticed), but their planes have no entertainment system on each seat, they do not play movies on the overhead screens, and they don‰Ûªt even have a free WiFi movie/tv option you can connect to using your phone! I‰Ûªm currently on a flight from Boston to Phoenix and was utterly shocked when I sat in my seat and noticed no form of entertainment for a cross-country flight. Delta and other airlines provide personal entertainment screens on each screen or a smartphone connect feature for 2+ hr flights, which in turn make the flights more enjoyable. Anyways, to avoid rambling on and on about the lack of technology on AA planes I‰Ûªll just say if you enjoyed traveling in the late 90s early 2000s, then AA is for you. If you want to travel in 2017 and beyond, find a different airline."
Graham of Christshurch, OTHER," July 18, 2008","I had a horrible experience today on my flight back to Miami. I have been an AAdvantage member for many years now and have always chosen to be loyal to American but after today's experience that may change. The onboarding process was fine and the flight was on time, which to be honest is rare but I was happy. When the snacks and beverage cart came the attendant did not smile, looked unhappy to take our beverage order, handed me and my husband 2 cookies, I then I told her, ""Can we just get pretzels?"" She said ""Then I need the cookies back."" I was honestly appalled."
James of Chandler, AZ," July 17, 2008","Don't deserve single star. Also, I have a flight from Chicago to Minneapolis 5 hours from now. And they have seats available on the earlier flight but won't give you without charging $75. They are ok to make you wait or fly a flight with empty seats but no customer delight which is no cost to them. No customer driven company and not looking for going extra mile to make customer happy. Never travel on American Airlines again."
Ann of Westland, MI," July 17, 2008","Worst experience ever with AA never again, they treated my dad like garbage, they humiliated my dad in front of my niece travelling with him and in front of all passengers, just because my dad is ** and not fluent in English. I wish I could sue them for discrimination against my dad for not speaking English fluent instead of offering assistance in Spanish which, the sky harbor airport in Arizona has plenty of bilingual employees. DO NOT FLY AA EVER, pay more with a different airline. The only reason why my dad and niece flew AA to go to my brother's funeral, thank you AA for the worst day ever. It's a shame I have to put a star instead of no stars service."
Julie of Kennewick, WA," July 16, 2008","This American Airlines review is out of frustration due to a lot of things. They're a disgrace! The employees are rude, there is no leg room, no entertainment, and treat people like herds of sheep. They have a ""New"" rule where they charge $50 at the gate to carry on your luggage. Are you kidding me? $50 for a carry on? And I can't even use the overhead bin! Disgraceful! Basically these guys are crooks! They're a disgrace. Last time I flew with American their flight was delayed by 2 hours and we ended up missing our connecting flight because it was the last flight out. We ended up having to stay an extra day and had to pay $100 for a hotel. We missed my sisters wedding. On the way back we ended up stuck on the tarmac for 2 hours. Of course!"
Lee of Syracuse, NY," July 15, 2008","I booked a ticket back when the hurricane were hitting down south every other week. Because of that I was not able to attend my trip in GA. They told me I had up to a year to use my ticket. So when I try to rebook my ticket they are now close to $500. Mind you this is the highest rate out of all the airlines for my particular dates, I asked for a refund because I didn't wanna double what I paid the first time and I was told by the Supervisor (Willie ** in Dallas ) that my only option was to ""use it or lost it"". Being a supervisor myself I thought the tone in which he said it was very careless and he didn't try to help the situation at all. I would never talk to my customers the way he spoke to me especially after losing out on $300!!"
Sabrina of Toluca Lake, CA," July 15, 2008","I just completed a flight on American Airlines. I had read negative reviews, but I found the American Airlines people I had contact with were great, tried to provide all the service they could because our flight had been cancelled due WX and had to layover at ORD. My complaint is the phoney coupon given for a hotel room for a ""discounted rate"". The coupon has nothing to do with American Airlines, but is only a hotel booking service. When I called the phone number provided I was told the only available room was 10 miles away and given a rate of $80.00. It was getting late in the evening so took it. Then was advised there was a $15 service charge to book the room. American Airline paid none of this. The shuttle bus to the hotel was packed (Other delayed passengers). When I got home I checked the hotel rate and found the same room went for $105. I ""saved"" $10. The hotel was a Holiday Inn Express. Room not bad."
Jeff of Wilson, NY," July 13, 2008","I was en route from San Antonio Texas to Hong Kong and when checking in for the domestic portion of the flight at the ticket counter, the woman claimed there was a problem with my passport. I asked for details and she claimed ""There are spots on your passport."" I told her the passport was still valid and did not expire until the following year."" She made up some baloney about Homeland Security not letting people fly with spots on their passport. I told her I checked their website and there was no mention of anything like that. She then claimed, ""Oh, they don't tell you."" I said, ""Then how are you supposed to know?"" She then sarcastically claimed I needed glasses, so I put my glasses on and told her those so called spots are not a problem. "

While I was away, I heard the news that my dad had passed away. In which, I contacted American Airlines right away and asked if anything can be done. I wanted to fly back before my actual trip date, due to obvious reasons. I even offered to provide them with a death certificate if need be (although, I don't think that is even something they should ask for right away). I spoke to 3 different customer service reps who were all horrible to speak with. They had zero compassion and empathy and just dismissed me as if what I was experiencing was far from a big deal to them. "
Ronald of Fayetteville, NC," July 10, 2008","I was on the plane for 14 hours due to a delay. Sitting in a broken seat that would not recline. I told the stewardess and she could care less, said nothing she can do. After I got home I contacted the airline and they issued me a fourteen dollar credit. I had paid 197.34 dollars for preferred seats. The worst flight of my life, never again w/ this airline."
Charles of Skaneateles, NY," July 9, 2008","Overall, (Un)American Airlines continues to disappoint. I really only ever fly with AA as a last resort, and I can't see any reason to recommend traveling with AA. I was prior active duty Army, and now I'm a reservist, and only American Airlines makes me feel like my service is less important now. United, Southwest, Jet Blue, Delta, every other airline doesn't discriminate between Active Duty and Reserve/Guardsmen when it comes to bag fees. So, along with uncomfortable, outdated planes and poor service, I spent a $100 checking bags to and from my destination."

I‰Ûªm currently on a flight from Boston to Phoenix and was utterly shocked when I sat in my seat and noticed no form of entertainment for a cross-country flight. Delta and other airlines provide personal entertainment screens on each screen or a smartphone connect feature for 2+ hr flights, which in turn make the flights more enjoyable. Anyways, to avoid rambling on and on about the lack of technology on AA planes I‰Ûªll just say if you enjoyed traveling in the late 90s early 2000s, then AA is for you. If you want to travel in 2017 and beyond, find a different airline."
Ian of Cardiff, OTHER," June 16, 2008","I had a horrible experience today on my flight back to Miami. I have been an AAdvantage member for many years now and have always chosen to be loyal to American but after today's experience that may change. The onboarding process was fine and the flight was on time, which to be honest is rare but I was happy. When the snacks and beverage cart came the attendant did not smile, looked unhappy to take our beverage order, handed me and my husband 2 cookies, I then I told her, ""Can we just get pretzels?"" She said ""Then I need the cookies back."" I was honestly appalled."
Jennifer of Tacoma, WA," June 14, 2008","Don't deserve single star. Also, I have a flight from Chicago to Minneapolis 5 hours from now. And they have seats available on the earlier flight but won't give you without charging $75. They are ok to make you wait or fly a flight with empty seats but no customer delight which is no cost to them. No customer driven company and not looking for going extra mile to make customer happy. Never travel on American Airlines again."
Megan of Sylva, NC," June 12, 2008","Worst experience ever with AA never again, they treated my dad like garbage, they humiliated my dad in front of my niece travelling with him and in front of all passengers, just because my dad is ** and not fluent in English. I wish I could sue them for discrimination against my dad for not speaking English fluent instead of offering assistance in Spanish which, the sky harbor airport in Arizona has plenty of bilingual employees. DO NOT FLY AA EVER, pay more with a different airline. The only reason why my dad and niece flew AA to go to my brother's funeral, thank you AA for the worst day ever. It's a shame I have to put a star instead of no stars service."
David of Lake Wylie, SC," June 10, 2008","This American Airlines review is out of frustration due to a lot of things. They're a disgrace! The employees are rude, there is no leg room, no entertainment, and treat people like herds of sheep. They have a ""New"" rule where they charge $50 at the gate to carry on your luggage. Are you kidding me? $50 for a carry on? And I can't even use the overhead bin! Disgraceful! Basically these guys are crooks! They're a disgrace. Last time I flew with American their flight was delayed by 2 hours and we ended up missing our connecting flight because it was the last flight out. We ended up having to stay an extra day and had to pay $100 for a hotel. We missed my sisters wedding. On the way back we ended up stuck on the tarmac for 2 hours. Of course!"
Lamora of Bath, NY," June 9, 2008","I booked a ticket back when the hurricane were hitting down south every other week. Because of that I was not able to attend my trip in GA. They told me I had up to a year to use my ticket. So when I try to rebook my ticket they are now close to $500. Mind you this is the highest rate out of all the airlines for my particular dates, I asked for a refund because I didn't wanna double what I paid the first time and I was told by the Supervisor (Willie ** in Dallas ) that my only option was to ""use it or lost it"". Being a supervisor myself I thought the tone in which he said it was very careless and he didn't try to help the situation at all. I would never talk to my customers the way he spoke to me especially after losing out on $300!!"
John of Arab, AL," June 7, 2008","I just completed a flight on American Airlines. I had read negative reviews, but I found the American Airlines people I had contact with were great, tried to provide all the service they could because our flight had been cancelled due WX and had to layover at ORD. My complaint is the phoney coupon given for a hotel room for a ""discounted rate"". The coupon has nothing to do with American Airlines, but is only a hotel booking service. When I called the phone number provided I was told the only available room was 10 miles away and given a rate of $80.00. It was getting late in the evening so took it. Then was advised there was a $15 service charge to book the room. American Airline paid none of this. The shuttle bus to the hotel was packed (Other delayed passengers). When I got home I checked the hotel rate and found the same room went for $105. I ""saved"" $10. The hotel was a Holiday Inn Express. Room not bad."

She made up some baloney about Homeland Security not letting people fly with spots on their passport. I told her I checked their website and there was no mention of anything like that. She then claimed, ""Oh, they don't tell you."" I said, ""Then how are you supposed to know?""

While I was away, I heard the news that my dad had passed away. In which, I contacted American Airlines right away and asked if anything can be done. I wanted to fly back before my actual trip date, due to obvious reasons. I even offered to provide them with a death certificate if need be (although, I don't think that is even something they should ask for right away). I spoke to 3 different customer service reps who were all horrible to speak with. They had zero compassion and empathy and just dismissed me as if what I was experiencing was far from a big deal to them. "
Constance of South Holland, IL," May 31, 2008","I was on the plane for 14 hours due to a delay. Sitting in a broken seat that would not recline. I told the stewardess and she could care less, said nothing she can do. After I got home I contacted the airline and they issued me a fourteen dollar credit. I had paid 197.34 dollars for preferred seats. The worst flight of my life, never again w/ this airline."
Jennifer of San Luis Obispo, CA," May 30, 2008","Overall, (Un)American Airlines continues to disappoint. I really only ever fly with AA as a last resort, and I can't see any reason to recommend traveling with AA. I was prior active duty Army, and now I'm a reservist, and only American Airlines makes me feel like my service is less important now. United, Southwest, Jet Blue, Delta, every other airline doesn't discriminate between Active Duty and Reserve/Guardsmen when it comes to bag fees. So, along with uncomfortable, outdated planes and poor service, I spent a $100 checking bags to and from my destination."
Bill of Ketchum, ID," May 30, 2008",American Airlines is the worst airlines to fly anywhere. They cram you in the seats with no leg room or any room for that matter. I requested a wheelchair at airport and waited 30 minutes upon someone finally arriving. They took me the wrong way to my next check in and I missed my flight. They said I would have to rebook my ticket and just wait for the next flight. Attendant at the gate was very disrespectful and not helpful at all. I had no control over this situation at all. Not to mention when I did finally arrive at my destination that I requested a wheelchair prior to my departure.
Carol of Las Vegas, NV," May 30, 2008","American Airlines is the worst airline in THE WORLD, and should change their name, it is utterly disgraceful that as an American they use this name. Their policy is to not apologize for anything, to be as rude as possible to people who are basically held hostage to them and their BS policies like closing the door to the gate while people are standing there then charging them money to rebook their flight, not caring at all about the bags on their way to a destination without the owners there to pick them up. Then being told when lodging a complaint that it was going in one ear and out the other. I have never been treated so poorly in my life, I will never again fly with this airline, I hope they go bankrupt and get the worst karma life can give. Oh yeah and I get to fly with them tomorrow. :/"
Carol of Pendleton, OR," May 29, 2008","Very disappointed. Unlikely I will ever choose American Airlines again. I didn't make my flight in the spring. I was given a voucher to use for future travel. Now I'm being told I can only use it myself, and not for my family. I don't want to use it for myself. What difference does it make? I'm being told different things by different people. The last guy hung up on me and I wasn't even rude to him. This is how AA does business? All I want is to not be penalized for cancelling a flight that was beyond my control. If you have a voucher it should be flexible to use for anyone. AA is the WORST! Hope they go out of business for this nonsense. Airline travel is a joke."
Rodrigo of Puerto Rico, OTHER," May 29, 2008","American Airlines canceled my 92-year-old father-in-law's flight to Key West due to Hurricane Irma. On that day American Airline was contacted and the representative said there would be no problem re-booking, just use the reference number. American Airlines even went on TV and said they would waive re-booking fees. Today when calling to re-book the flight and after 57 minutes on the phone, I was told the flight could not be re-booked because it was in their notes I requested a refund. At no time did I request a refund and American Airlines could not locate any record of a refund request. Even so, American Airlines still insisted they could not re-book the flight or issue a refund. If we did not have enough trouble dealing with a Cat 4 hurricane and its devastating aftermath, now American Airlines is adding to the misery. All my father-in-law wants is to come to Key West and see that everyone is alright. Thanks, AA."
Arthur of Coral Springs, FL," May 28, 2008",I bought tickets for my mother in law and son to meet my wife and I in Colorado. We had traveled on different airlines due to connections and therefore were going back on different airlines. My wife and I left on our airplane. My mother in law and son were stranded as the plane had a mechanical. This was 8 AM and the bottom line was it didn't get fixed that day. American gave them a 12.00 voucher good in the terminal and did nothing to get them a room as the rooms they usually used weren't available.
Belinda of Austin, TX," May 28, 2008","I booked 2 separate flights on American Airlines in Economy since I pay for my air travel. On one they pre-assigned me a back-of-plane middle seat and said that I was required to pay some increased fee for window, aisle or closer to the front. On the second flight they said I have to wait until I reach the boarding gate for any seat. This is ridiculous and unacceptable. The airline has sufficient revenue to - just a suggestion - increase the ""base"" fare to cover a first-come-first-served seat selection and not put everyone into 3rd class or worse status. If they want to surcharge certain premium seats, like middle seats toward the front, that's OK, but this behavior is totally unacceptable and I refuse to fly them (or any airline) that abuses their passengers."
Steve of Fernley, NV," May 28, 2008",Well I looked into changing my flight for my fiance and I to go home a day earlier... only to discover that American charges $200.00 a ticket PLUS the difference in price tickets! LIKE THAT IS GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE! So for the price of another ticket I can change my flight! I will be looking elsewhere for flights in the future. I have already paid for a flight and now you are trying to rip me off even more!?! Out of touch and terrible service to a customer of over 5 years. I will be going elsewhere where I don't get bent over the table. Thank you American!
Bridgett of Austin, TX," May 28, 2008","I originally booked my flight to Miami from Washington, DC back in July 2017. I was scheduled to fly September 13-18, 2017. I, like many, had to cancel my trip because of hurricane Irma. I was informed by two customer service representatives that I would be able to rebook my flight to Miami with no additional charges in fare and no change fees. Of course, when it comes time to book my flight, I'm informed about a change fee. I told the agent, I was reassured twice that I would not be charged any additional fees because my initial cancellation was weather related. "
Richard of Menomonie, WI," May 26, 2008","American Airlines is full of **. Our cruise was cancelled due to Hurricane Irma. It was beyond our control and the airline stated there was nothing that they could do. No partial credit, changes or anything! I will not be flying with them anymore!"
Michael of Glendale, CA," May 22, 2008",My husband and I were scheduled to fly out at 7:15 am to go to California for a very important family matter. We do not live near the airport so we were up early to make sure we were early and nothing could go wrong. But things did go wrong. When we got to the airport we went and printed out tickets at the self checkout. We did notice that it mentioned no overhead storage for our carry on bags. So confused because we fly a lot and there is always overhead storage or they place in under the cabin. So we asked a lady that was standing in the area of self print and she looked and our tickets said we would be fine... Again we were told wrong.
Nicole of Washington, DC," May 20, 2008","On September 4 my family of 5 arrived at the airport in Anchorage to fly home to Toronto via Dallas. Four of us had carry-on sized luggage but one had a mid-sized suitcase that we knew we would have to check. Our flight to Toronto included a 12.5-hour connection at DFW (not by choice). Since none of us sleep well on planes, we were considering going to a hotel following the overnight flight to DFW. When checking the suitcase, I specifically asked the American Airlines agent ""if we only check this bag to DFW and then go to a hotel for a few hours of sleep, will we be charged a second baggage fee to check the bag in for the flight to Toronto? If so we can rearrange the bags so that we can just check it through to Toronto."" "
Carlos of Patchogue, NY," May 19, 2008","I purchased the basic economy ticket. When I was getting ready to board in Charlotte, the attendant mentioned that this was a new program for your airline and that customers have stated it was cost effective. However, this was not my case! I paid nearly $600 to fly from Columbus, OH to Asheville, NC. Absolutely absurd!!! In the future, I will do all I can to avoid flying with your airline and don't count on a positive recommendation from me to others! Also, stop charging for the first piece of checked in luggage!"

I called at night again because I was worried I saw it was still cancel. After almost 2 hours they answered the phone. I told them what happened. They told me that they were very sorry but the flight was canceled and they didnt' have flight for Sept 12. They gave me 1 stop flight for Sept 13. "
Hiroaki of Oceanside, CA," May 13, 2008","I was scheduled to fly out of Tampa International on Sunday, September, 17th to Durango, CO. I live in Sarasota, and just returned home the other day after evacuating for Hurricane Irma. I fled Florida and headed to Georgia, where I had to rent a hotel for a few nights. When I returned home I was fortunate enough not to have suffered damage. I of course have yard debris strewn about and I am still without power. The power company has estimated by the end of the day on September 22nd I will have power. With the extra costs incurred from having to leave my home, and the loss of power, I decided this was not a good time to travel."
Erin of Fall River, MA," May 12, 2008","Hurricane Irma was mess for AA. I get it. I'm sure there were thousands who were stuck trying to get their flights changed. Unfortunately, I was in Costa Rica with a connection via Miami and I got, as the AA agent said ""the short end of the stick."" I would be stuck almost another week in Costa Rica as everything AA had was booked out or cancelled. I saw a little bit of silver lining when I found that if I could get to Mexico city, I could fly home via DFW. However, AA would not change the ticket as it is against their rules to change the country of origin on a ticket. ""We cannot do it."" However, a more accurate description is ""will not."""
Barbara of Indianapolis, IN," May 12, 2008","We were delayed on our AA out of Seattle due to having to wait on flight crew. Managed to make it to Dallas on time BUT had to sit on the tarmac for 20 mins waiting for a gait in order to deplane. This caused to miss our connecting flight. Next available flight is the next day. Asked about compensation for overnight hotel stay (there are 7 in our party, including a 3 year old) and were denied due to the delay being coded as weather related, which is absolutely bogus. So livid, frustrated, and tired at this point. Also found out AA has no number to call for complaints... You have to go through email so who knows if they will even read it or reply. Will never fly AA again if I can help it."
Florence of Tucson, AZ," May 10, 2008","I was on an almost 2 hour flight (Flight AA3936) stuck sitting with one leg over my bag and the other on the edge of the aisle. Not once was I asked to check in my bag nor told it wouldn't fit on the overhead bin. By the time we landed my knees, hips and back were killing me and I had to have help from the gentleman next to me to be able to stand up. So glad there wasn't an emergency 'cause this would have been one hell of a hazard. Lesson learned not to use this airline again."
Olivier of Miami, FL," May 9, 2008","American Airlines‰Û_the new standard for horrible service. Oh‰Û_I mean HORRIBLE!

On the second flight they said I have to wait until I reach the boarding gate for any seat. This is ridiculous and unacceptable. The airline has sufficient revenue to - just a suggestion - increase the ""base"" fare to cover a first-come-first-served seat selection and not put everyone into 3rd class or worse status. If they want to surcharge certain premium seats, like middle seats toward the front, that's OK, but this behavior is totally unacceptable and I refuse to fly them (or any airline) that abuses their passengers."
Stephanie of Queen Creek, AZ," April 4, 2008",Well I looked into changing my flight for my fiance and I to go home a day earlier... only to discover that American charges $200.00 a ticket PLUS the difference in price tickets! LIKE THAT IS GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE! So for the price of another ticket I can change my flight! I will be looking elsewhere for flights in the future. I have already paid for a flight and now you are trying to rip me off even more!?! Out of touch and terrible service to a customer of over 5 years. I will be going elsewhere where I don't get bent over the table. Thank you American!
Mark of Flint, MI," April 3, 2008","I originally booked my flight to Miami from Washington, DC back in July 2017. I was scheduled to fly September 13-18, 2017. I, like many, had to cancel my trip because of hurricane Irma. I was informed by two customer service representatives that I would be able to rebook my flight to Miami with no additional charges in fare and no change fees. Of course, when it comes time to book my flight, I'm informed about a change fee. I told the agent, I was reassured twice that I would not be charged any additional fees because my initial cancellation was weather related. "
Maria of Falciano, OTHER," April 2, 2008","American Airlines is full of **. Our cruise was cancelled due to Hurricane Irma. It was beyond our control and the airline stated there was nothing that they could do. No partial credit, changes or anything! I will not be flying with them anymore!"
Darlene of Ft Garland, CO," April 2, 2008",My husband and I were scheduled to fly out at 7:15 am to go to California for a very important family matter. We do not live near the airport so we were up early to make sure we were early and nothing could go wrong. But things did go wrong. When we got to the airport we went and printed out tickets at the self checkout. We did notice that it mentioned no overhead storage for our carry on bags. So confused because we fly a lot and there is always overhead storage or they place in under the cabin. So we asked a lady that was standing in the area of self print and she looked and our tickets said we would be fine... Again we were told wrong.
Denise of Staten Island, NY," April 1, 2008","On September 4 my family of 5 arrived at the airport in Anchorage to fly home to Toronto via Dallas. Four of us had carry-on sized luggage but one had a mid-sized suitcase that we knew we would have to check. Our flight to Toronto included a 12.5-hour connection at DFW (not by choice). Since none of us sleep well on planes, we were considering going to a hotel following the overnight flight to DFW. When checking the suitcase, I specifically asked the American Airlines agent ""if we only check this bag to DFW and then go to a hotel for a few hours of sleep, will we be charged a second baggage fee to check the bag in for the flight to Toronto? If so we can rearrange the bags so that we can just check it through to Toronto."" "
Olga of Minneapolis, MN," March 30, 2008","I purchased the basic economy ticket. When I was getting ready to board in Charlotte, the attendant mentioned that this was a new program for your airline and that customers have stated it was cost effective. However, this was not my case! I paid nearly $600 to fly from Columbus, OH to Asheville, NC. Absolutely absurd!!! In the future, I will do all I can to avoid flying with your airline and don't count on a positive recommendation from me to others! Also, stop charging for the first piece of checked in luggage!"
Kara of Lincoln, NE," March 29, 2008","I did a reservation with AA Sept 10, 2017 over the phone to Miami for Sept 12, 2017 in the flight # 1399. September 11 I checked the flight online and it was canceled. I called customer service. Patricia told me that I was wrong it wasn't cancel. I called at night again because I was worried I saw it was still cancel. After almost 2 hours they answered the phone. I told them what happened. They told me that they were very sorry but the flight was canceled and they didnt' have flight for Sept 12. They gave me 1 stop flight for Sept 13. "
Terri of El Paso, TX," March 27, 2008","I was scheduled to fly out of Tampa International on Sunday, September, 17th to Durango, CO. I live in Sarasota, and just returned home the other day after evacuating for Hurricane Irma. I fled Florida and headed to Georgia, where I had to rent a hotel for a few nights. When I returned home I was fortunate enough not to have suffered damage. I of course have yard debris strewn about and I am still without power. The power company has estimated by the end of the day on September 22nd I will have power. With the extra costs incurred from having to leave my home, and the loss of power, I decided this was not a good time to travel."
Tom of Mount Airy, MD," March 26, 2008","Hurricane Irma was mess for AA. I get it. I'm sure there were thousands who were stuck trying to get their flights changed. Unfortunately, I was in Costa Rica with a connection via Miami and I got, as the AA agent said ""the short end of the stick."" I would be stuck almost another week in Costa Rica as everything AA had was booked out or cancelled. I saw a little bit of silver lining when I found that if I could get to Mexico city, I could fly home via DFW. However, AA would not change the ticket as it is against their rules to change the country of origin on a ticket. ""We cannot do it."" However, a more accurate description is ""will not."""
Elaine of Rochester, NY," March 26, 2008","We were delayed on our AA out of Seattle due to having to wait on flight crew. Managed to make it to Dallas on time BUT had to sit on the tarmac for 20 mins waiting for a gait in order to deplane. This caused to miss our connecting flight. Next available flight is the next day. Asked about compensation for overnight hotel stay (there are 7 in our party, including a 3 year old) and were denied due to the delay being coded as weather related, which is absolutely bogus. So livid, frustrated, and tired at this point. Also found out AA has no number to call for complaints... You have to go through email so who knows if they will even read it or reply. Will never fly AA again if I can help it."
Barbara of San Jose, CA," March 22, 2008","I was on an almost 2 hour flight (Flight AA3936) stuck sitting with one leg over my bag and the other on the edge of the aisle. Not once was I asked to check in my bag nor told it wouldn't fit on the overhead bin. By the time we landed my knees, hips and back were killing me and I had to have help from the gentleman next to me to be able to stand up. So glad there wasn't an emergency 'cause this would have been one hell of a hazard. Lesson learned not to use this airline again."
Amanda of Greenbrier, AR," March 21, 2008","American Airlines‰Û_the new standard for horrible service. Oh‰Û_I mean HORRIBLE! I travel very frequently for work and have stuck to one specific airline in order to build my status with them (ie. first class upgrades often, better seat choices, free checked bags). Recently, service has taken a turn for the worse. I‰Ûªm a reasonable guy and tolerate more than most. Call it my Southern hospitality, my upbringing or my service to the community when I served in law enforcement, but I just plain put up with more‰Û_until now."
Barbara of Boston, VA," March 20, 2008","I travel 80%~ for Work and have flown with almost every airline multiple times. AA is by far the worst. Not due to their customer service/staff/delays or anything like that (at least that I‰Ûªve noticed), but their planes have no entertainment system on each seat, they do not play movies on the overhead screens, and they don‰Ûªt even have a free WiFi movie/tv option you can connect to using your phone! I‰Ûªm currently on a flight from Boston to Phoenix and was utterly shocked when I sat in my seat and noticed no form of entertainment for a cross-country flight. Delta and other airlines provide personal entertainment screens on each screen or a smartphone connect feature for 2+ hr flights, which in turn make the flights more enjoyable. Anyways, to avoid rambling on and on about the lack of technology on AA planes I‰Ûªll just say if you enjoyed traveling in the late 90s early 2000s, then AA is for you. If you want to travel in 2017 and beyond, find a different airline."
Thomas of Rockledge, FL," March 18, 2008","I had a horrible experience today on my flight back to Miami. I have been an AAdvantage member for many years now and have always chosen to be loyal to American but after today's experience that may change. The onboarding process was fine and the flight was on time, which to be honest is rare but I was happy. When the snacks and beverage cart came the attendant did not smile, looked unhappy to take our beverage order, handed me and my husband 2 cookies, I then I told her, ""Can we just get pretzels?"" She said ""Then I need the cookies back."" I was honestly appalled."
Karin of Everson, WA," March 17, 2008","Don't deserve single star. Also, I have a flight from Chicago to Minneapolis 5 hours from now. And they have seats available on the earlier flight but won't give you without charging $75. They are ok to make you wait or fly a flight with empty seats but no customer delight which is no cost to them. No customer driven company and not looking for going extra mile to make customer happy. Never travel on American Airlines again."
Brian of Dallas, TX," March 17, 2008","Worst experience ever with AA never again, they treated my dad like garbage, they humiliated my dad in front of my niece travelling with him and in front of all passengers, just because my dad is ** and not fluent in English. I wish I could sue them for discrimination against my dad for not speaking English fluent instead of offering assistance in Spanish which, the sky harbor airport in Arizona has plenty of bilingual employees. DO NOT FLY AA EVER, pay more with a different airline. The only reason why my dad and niece flew AA to go to my brother's funeral, thank you AA for the worst day ever. It's a shame I have to put a star instead of no stars service."
Tizzy of Solon, OH," March 17, 2008","This American Airlines review is out of frustration due to a lot of things. They're a disgrace! The employees are rude, there is no leg room, no entertainment, and treat people like herds of sheep. They have a ""New"" rule where they charge $50 at the gate to carry on your luggage. Are you kidding me? $50 for a carry on? And I can't even use the overhead bin! Disgraceful! Basically these guys are crooks! They're a disgrace. Last time I flew with American their flight was delayed by 2 hours and we ended up missing our connecting flight because it was the last flight out. We ended up having to stay an extra day and had to pay $100 for a hotel. We missed my sisters wedding. On the way back we ended up stuck on the tarmac for 2 hours. Of course!"
Bill of Highland Park, IL," March 15, 2008","I booked a ticket back when the hurricane were hitting down south every other week. Because of that I was not able to attend my trip in GA. They told me I had up to a year to use my ticket. So when I try to rebook my ticket they are now close to $500. Mind you this is the highest rate out of all the airlines for my particular dates, I asked for a refund because I didn't wanna double what I paid the first time and I was told by the Supervisor (Willie ** in Dallas ) that my only option was to ""use it or lost it"". Being a supervisor myself I thought the tone in which he said it was very careless and he didn't try to help the situation at all. I would never talk to my customers the way he spoke to me especially after losing out on $300!!"
Joe of Corona Del Mar, CA," March 12, 2008","I just completed a flight on American Airlines. I had read negative reviews, but I found the American Airlines people I had contact with were great, tried to provide all the service they could because our flight had been cancelled due WX and had to layover at ORD. My complaint is the phoney coupon given for a hotel room for a ""discounted rate"". The coupon has nothing to do with American Airlines, but is only a hotel booking service. When I called the phone number provided I was told the only available room was 10 miles away and given a rate of $80.00. It was getting late in the evening so took it. Then was advised there was a $15 service charge to book the room. American Airline paid none of this. The shuttle bus to the hotel was packed (Other delayed passengers). When I got home I checked the hotel rate and found the same room went for $105. I ""saved"" $10. The hotel was a Holiday Inn Express. Room not bad."
Michael of South Bound Brook, NJ," March 10, 2008","I was en route from San Antonio Texas to Hong Kong and when checking in for the domestic portion of the flight at the ticket counter, the woman claimed there was a problem with my passport. I asked for details and she claimed ""There are spots on your passport."" I told her the passport was still valid and did not expire until the following year."" She made up some baloney about Homeland Security not letting people fly with spots on their passport. I told her I checked their website and there was no mention of anything like that. She then claimed, ""Oh, they don't tell you."" I said, ""Then how are you supposed to know?"" She then sarcastically claimed I needed glasses, so I put my glasses on and told her those so called spots are not a problem. "

Drew of Seattle, WA," March 5, 2008","Where do I even begin? I had a round trip flight booked from Toronto, Ontario to Busan, South Korea back in the month of July (2017). While I was away, I heard the news that my dad had passed away. In which, I contacted American Airlines right away and asked if anything can be done. I wanted to fly back before my actual trip date, due to obvious reasons. I even offered to provide them with a death certificate if need be (although, I don't think that is even something they should ask for right away). I spoke to 3 different customer service reps who were all horrible to speak with. They had zero compassion and empathy and just dismissed me as if what I was experiencing was far from a big deal to them. "
Scott of Redond Beach, CA," March 5, 2008","I was on the plane for 14 hours due to a delay. Sitting in a broken seat that would not recline. I told the stewardess and she could care less, said nothing she can do. After I got home I contacted the airline and they issued me a fourteen dollar credit. I had paid 197.34 dollars for preferred seats. The worst flight of my life, never again w/ this airline."
Mary of Saint Augustine, FL," March 1, 2008","Overall, (Un)American Airlines continues to disappoint. I really only ever fly with AA as a last resort, and I can't see any reason to recommend traveling with AA. I was prior active duty Army, and now I'm a reservist, and only American Airlines makes me feel like my service is less important now. United, Southwest, Jet Blue, Delta, every other airline doesn't discriminate between Active Duty and Reserve/Guardsmen when it comes to bag fees. So, along with uncomfortable, outdated planes and poor service, I spent a $100 checking bags to and from my destination."
Michael of Oak Creek, WI," Feb. 27, 2008",American Airlines is the worst airlines to fly anywhere. They cram you in the seats with no leg room or any room for that matter. I requested a wheelchair at airport and waited 30 minutes upon someone finally arriving. They took me the wrong way to my next check in and I missed my flight. They said I would have to rebook my ticket and just wait for the next flight. Attendant at the gate was very disrespectful and not helpful at all. I had no control over this situation at all. Not to mention when I did finally arrive at my destination that I requested a wheelchair prior to my departure.
Nick of Hatfield, PA," Feb. 20, 2008","American Airlines is the worst airline in THE WORLD, and should change their name, it is utterly disgraceful that as an American they use this name. Their policy is to not apologize for anything, to be as rude as possible to people who are basically held hostage to them and their BS policies like closing the door to the gate while people are standing there then charging them money to rebook their flight, not caring at all about the bags on their way to a destination without the owners there to pick them up. Then being told when lodging a complaint that it was going in one ear and out the other. I have never been treated so poorly in my life, I will never again fly with this airline, I hope they go bankrupt and get the worst karma life can give. Oh yeah and I get to fly with them tomorrow. :/"
Gwen of Altoona, AL," Feb. 19, 2008","Very disappointed. Unlikely I will ever choose American Airlines again. I didn't make my flight in the spring. I was given a voucher to use for future travel. Now I'm being told I can only use it myself, and not for my family. I don't want to use it for myself. What difference does it make? I'm being told different things by different people. The last guy hung up on me and I wasn't even rude to him. This is how AA does business? All I want is to not be penalized for cancelling a flight that was beyond my control. If you have a voucher it should be flexible to use for anyone. AA is the WORST! Hope they go out of business for this nonsense. Airline travel is a joke."
Carlos of Houston, TX," Feb. 19, 2008","American Airlines canceled my 92-year-old father-in-law's flight to Key West due to Hurricane Irma. On that day American Airline was contacted and the representative said there would be no problem re-booking, just use the reference number. American Airlines even went on TV and said they would waive re-booking fees. Today when calling to re-book the flight and after 57 minutes on the phone, I was told the flight could not be re-booked because it was in their notes I requested a refund. At no time did I request a refund and American Airlines could not locate any record of a refund request. Even so, American Airlines still insisted they could not re-book the flight or issue a refund. If we did not have enough trouble dealing with a Cat 4 hurricane and its devastating aftermath, now American Airlines is adding to the misery. All my father-in-law wants is to come to Key West and see that everyone is alright. Thanks, AA."
Marc of Fort Worth, TX," Feb. 18, 2008",I bought tickets for my mother in law and son to meet my wife and I in Colorado. We had traveled on different airlines due to connections and therefore were going back on different airlines. My wife and I left on our airplane. My mother in law and son were stranded as the plane had a mechanical. This was 8 AM and the bottom line was it didn't get fixed that day. American gave them a 12.00 voucher good in the terminal and did nothing to get them a room as the rooms they usually used weren't available.

Mind you this is the highest rate out of all the airlines for my particular dates, I asked for a refund because I didn't wanna double what I paid the first time and I was told by the Supervisor (Willie ** in Dallas ) that my only option was to ""use it or lost it"". Being a supervisor myself I thought the tone in which he said it was very careless and he didn't try to help the situation at all. I would never talk to my customers the way he spoke to me especially after losing out on $300!!"
Rachel of Las Vegas, NV," Jan. 4, 2008","I just completed a flight on American Airlines. I had read negative reviews, but I found the American Airlines people I had contact with were great, tried to provide all the service they could because our flight had been cancelled due WX and had to layover at ORD. My complaint is the phoney coupon given for a hotel room for a ""discounted rate"". The coupon has nothing to do with American Airlines, but is only a hotel booking service. When I called the phone number provided I was told the only available room was 10 miles away and given a rate of $80.00. It was getting late in the evening so took it. Then was advised there was a $15 service charge to book the room. American Airline paid none of this. The shuttle bus to the hotel was packed (Other delayed passengers). When I got home I checked the hotel rate and found the same room went for $105. I ""saved"" $10. The hotel was a Holiday Inn Express. Room not bad."
John of Corpus Christi, TX," Jan. 3, 2008","I was en route from San Antonio Texas to Hong Kong and when checking in for the domestic portion of the flight at the ticket counter, the woman claimed there was a problem with my passport.

She made up some baloney about Homeland Security not letting people fly with spots on their passport. I told her I checked their website and there was no mention of anything like that. She then claimed, ""Oh, they don't tell you."" I said, ""Then how are you supposed to know?"" She then sarcastically claimed I needed glasses, so I put my glasses on and told her those so called spots are not a problem. "

Mark of Ozark, AL," Dec. 30, 2007","Where do I even begin? I had a round trip flight booked from Toronto, Ontario to Busan, South Korea back in the month of July (2017). While I was away, I heard the news that my dad had passed away. In which, I contacted American Airlines right away and asked if anything can be done. I wanted to fly back before my actual trip date, due to obvious reasons. I even offered to provide them with a death certificate if need be (although, I don't think that is even something they should ask for right away). I spoke to 3 different customer service reps who were all horrible to speak with. They had zero compassion and empathy and just dismissed me as if what I was experiencing was far from a big deal to them. "
Walter of Stamford, CT," Dec. 28, 2007","I was on the plane for 14 hours due to a delay. Sitting in a broken seat that would not recline. I told the stewardess and she could care less, said nothing she can do. After I got home I contacted the airline and they issued me a fourteen dollar credit. I had paid 197.34 dollars for preferred seats. The worst flight of my life, never again w/ this airline."
Katharine of Colorado Springs, CO," Dec. 27, 2007","Overall, (Un)American Airlines continues to disappoint. I really only ever fly with AA as a last resort, and I can't see any reason to recommend traveling with AA. I was prior active duty Army, and now I'm a reservist, and only American Airlines makes me feel like my service is less important now. United, Southwest, Jet Blue, Delta, every other airline doesn't discriminate between Active Duty and Reserve/Guardsmen when it comes to bag fees. So, along with uncomfortable, outdated planes and poor service, I spent a $100 checking bags to and from my destination."
B of Brooklyn, NY," Dec. 26, 2007",American Airlines is the worst airlines to fly anywhere. They cram you in the seats with no leg room or any room for that matter. I requested a wheelchair at airport and waited 30 minutes upon someone finally arriving. They took me the wrong way to my next check in and I missed my flight. They said I would have to rebook my ticket and just wait for the next flight. Attendant at the gate was very disrespectful and not helpful at all. I had no control over this situation at all. Not to mention when I did finally arrive at my destination that I requested a wheelchair prior to my departure.
Robin of Oakland, CA," Dec. 22, 2007","American Airlines is the worst airline in THE WORLD, and should change their name, it is utterly disgraceful that as an American they use this name. Their policy is to not apologize for anything, to be as rude as possible to people who are basically held hostage to them and their BS policies like closing the door to the gate while people are standing there then charging them money to rebook their flight, not caring at all about the bags on their way to a destination without the owners there to pick them up. Then being told when lodging a complaint that it was going in one ear and out the other. I have never been treated so poorly in my life, I will never again fly with this airline, I hope they go bankrupt and get the worst karma life can give. Oh yeah and I get to fly with them tomorrow. :/"
Hannah of Dallas, TX," Dec. 20, 2007","Very disappointed. Unlikely I will ever choose American Airlines again. I didn't make my flight in the spring. I was given a voucher to use for future travel. Now I'm being told I can only use it myself, and not for my family. I don't want to use it for myself. What difference does it make? I'm being told different things by different people. The last guy hung up on me and I wasn't even rude to him. This is how AA does business? All I want is to not be penalized for cancelling a flight that was beyond my control. If you have a voucher it should be flexible to use for anyone. AA is the WORST! Hope they go out of business for this nonsense. Airline travel is a joke."
Gerardo of West Babylon, NY," Dec. 20, 2007","American Airlines canceled my 92-year-old father-in-law's flight to Key West due to Hurricane Irma. On that day American Airline was contacted and the representative said there would be no problem re-booking, just use the reference number. American Airlines even went on TV and said they would waive re-booking fees. Today when calling to re-book the flight and after 57 minutes on the phone, I was told the flight could not be re-booked because it was in their notes I requested a refund. At no time did I request a refund and American Airlines could not locate any record of a refund request. Even so, American Airlines still insisted they could not re-book the flight or issue a refund. If we did not have enough trouble dealing with a Cat 4 hurricane and its devastating aftermath, now American Airlines is adding to the misery. All my father-in-law wants is to come to Key West and see that everyone is alright. Thanks, AA."
Tida of Novato, CA," Dec. 20, 2007",I bought tickets for my mother in law and son to meet my wife and I in Colorado. We had traveled on different airlines due to connections and therefore were going back on different airlines. My wife and I left on our airplane. My mother in law and son were stranded as the plane had a mechanical. This was 8 AM and the bottom line was it didn't get fixed that day. American gave them a 12.00 voucher good in the terminal and did nothing to get them a room as the rooms they usually used weren't available.
Michael of New Port Richey, FL," Dec. 19, 2007","I booked 2 separate flights on American Airlines in Economy since I pay for my air travel. On one they pre-assigned me a back-of-plane middle seat and said that I was required to pay some increased fee for window, aisle or closer to the front. On the second flight they said I have to wait until I reach the boarding gate for any seat. This is ridiculous and unacceptable. The airline has sufficient revenue to - just a suggestion - increase the ""base"" fare to cover a first-come-first-served seat selection and not put everyone into 3rd class or worse status. If they want to surcharge certain premium seats, like middle seats toward the front, that's OK, but this behavior is totally unacceptable and I refuse to fly them (or any airline) that abuses their passengers."
Najeeb of West Des Moines, IA," Dec. 17, 2007",Well I looked into changing my flight for my fiance and I to go home a day earlier... only to discover that American charges $200.00 a ticket PLUS the difference in price tickets! LIKE THAT IS GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE! So for the price of another ticket I can change my flight! I will be looking elsewhere for flights in the future. I have already paid for a flight and now you are trying to rip me off even more!?! Out of touch and terrible service to a customer of over 5 years. I will be going elsewhere where I don't get bent over the table. Thank you American!
Gary of Phoenix, AZ," Dec. 17, 2007","I originally booked my flight to Miami from Washington, DC back in July 2017. I was scheduled to fly September 13-18, 2017. I, like many, had to cancel my trip because of hurricane Irma. I was informed by two customer service representatives that I would be able to rebook my flight to Miami with no additional charges in fare and no change fees. Of course, when it comes time to book my flight, I'm informed about a change fee. I told the agent, I was reassured twice that I would not be charged any additional fees because my initial cancellation was weather related. "
Victor of Hanover, NH," Dec. 16, 2007","American Airlines is full of **. Our cruise was cancelled due to Hurricane Irma. It was beyond our control and the airline stated there was nothing that they could do. No partial credit, changes or anything! I will not be flying with them anymore!"
Victor of Hanover, NH," Dec. 16, 2007",My husband and I were scheduled to fly out at 7:15 am to go to California for a very important family matter. We do not live near the airport so we were up early to make sure we were early and nothing could go wrong. But things did go wrong. When we got to the airport we went and printed out tickets at the self checkout. We did notice that it mentioned no overhead storage for our carry on bags. So confused because we fly a lot and there is always overhead storage or they place in under the cabin. So we asked a lady that was standing in the area of self print and she looked and our tickets said we would be fine... Again we were told wrong.
Matt of Wylie, TX," Dec. 15, 2007","On September 4 my family of 5 arrived at the airport in Anchorage to fly home to Toronto via Dallas. Four of us had carry-on sized luggage but one had a mid-sized suitcase that we knew we would have to check. Our flight to Toronto included a 12.5-hour connection at DFW (not by choice). Since none of us sleep well on planes, we were considering going to a hotel following the overnight flight to DFW. When checking the suitcase, I specifically asked the American Airlines agent ""if we only check this bag to DFW and then go to a hotel for a few hours of sleep, will we be charged a second baggage fee to check the bag in for the flight to Toronto? If so we can rearrange the bags so that we can just check it through to Toronto."" "
Suzanna of Plainsboro, NJ," Dec. 11, 2007","I purchased the basic economy ticket. When I was getting ready to board in Charlotte, the attendant mentioned that this was a new program for your airline and that customers have stated it was cost effective. However, this was not my case! I paid nearly $600 to fly from Columbus, OH to Asheville, NC. Absolutely absurd!!! In the future, I will do all I can to avoid flying with your airline and don't count on a positive recommendation from me to others! Also, stop charging for the first piece of checked in luggage!"

I called at night again because I was worried I saw it was still cancel. After almost 2 hours they answered the phone. I told them what happened. They told me that they were very sorry but the flight was canceled and they didnt' have flight for Sept 12. They gave me 1 stop flight for Sept 13. "
Gina of Huntington Beach, CA," Dec. 11, 2007","I was scheduled to fly out of Tampa International on Sunday, September, 17th to Durango, CO. I live in Sarasota, and just returned home the other day after evacuating for Hurricane Irma. I fled Florida and headed to Georgia, where I had to rent a hotel for a few nights. When I returned home I was fortunate enough not to have suffered damage. I of course have yard debris strewn about and I am still without power. The power company has estimated by the end of the day on September 22nd I will have power. With the extra costs incurred from having to leave my home, and the loss of power, I decided this was not a good time to travel."
Charity of Greenville, NC," Dec. 10, 2007","Hurricane Irma was mess for AA. I get it. I'm sure there were thousands who were stuck trying to get their flights changed. Unfortunately, I was in Costa Rica with a connection via Miami and I got, as the AA agent said ""the short end of the stick."" I would be stuck almost another week in Costa Rica as everything AA had was booked out or cancelled. I saw a little bit of silver lining when I found that if I could get to Mexico city, I could fly home via DFW. However, AA would not change the ticket as it is against their rules to change the country of origin on a ticket. ""We cannot do it."" However, a more accurate description is ""will not."""
Kenneth of Chepachet, RI," Dec. 10, 2007","We were delayed on our AA out of Seattle due to having to wait on flight crew. Managed to make it to Dallas on time BUT had to sit on the tarmac for 20 mins waiting for a gait in order to deplane. This caused to miss our connecting flight. Next available flight is the next day. Asked about compensation for overnight hotel stay (there are 7 in our party, including a 3 year old) and were denied due to the delay being coded as weather related, which is absolutely bogus. So livid, frustrated, and tired at this point. Also found out AA has no number to call for complaints... You have to go through email so who knows if they will even read it or reply. Will never fly AA again if I can help it."
Diana of Jamaica, NY," Dec. 6, 2007","I was on an almost 2 hour flight (Flight AA3936) stuck sitting with one leg over my bag and the other on the edge of the aisle. Not once was I asked to check in my bag nor told it wouldn't fit on the overhead bin. By the time we landed my knees, hips and back were killing me and I had to have help from the gentleman next to me to be able to stand up. So glad there wasn't an emergency 'cause this would have been one hell of a hazard. Lesson learned not to use this airline again."
Randy of Green Bay, WI," Dec. 6, 2007","American Airlines‰Û_the new standard for horrible service. Oh‰Û_I mean HORRIBLE! I travel very frequently for work and have stuck to one specific airline in order to build my status with them (ie. first class upgrades often, better seat choices, free checked bags). Recently, service has taken a turn for the worse. I‰Ûªm a reasonable guy and tolerate more than most. Call it my Southern hospitality, my upbringing or my service to the community when I served in law enforcement, but I just plain put up with more‰Û_until now."
Dennis of Hooksett, NH," Dec. 5, 2007","I travel 80%~ for Work and have flown with almost every airline multiple times. AA is by far the worst. Not due to their customer service/staff/delays or anything like that (at least that I‰Ûªve noticed), but their planes have no entertainment system on each seat, they do not play movies on the overhead screens, and they don‰Ûªt even have a free WiFi movie/tv option you can connect to using your phone! I‰Ûªm currently on a flight from Boston to Phoenix and was utterly shocked when I sat in my seat and noticed no form of entertainment for a cross-country flight. Delta and other airlines provide personal entertainment screens on each screen or a smartphone connect feature for 2+ hr flights, which in turn make the flights more enjoyable. Anyways, to avoid rambling on and on about the lack of technology on AA planes I‰Ûªll just say if you enjoyed traveling in the late 90s early 2000s, then AA is for you. If you want to travel in 2017 and beyond, find a different airline."
Suzanna of Plainsboro, NJ," Dec. 4, 2007","I had a horrible experience today on my flight back to Miami. I have been an AAdvantage member for many years now and have always chosen to be loyal to American but after today's experience that may change. The onboarding process was fine and the flight was on time, which to be honest is rare but I was happy. When the snacks and beverage cart came the attendant did not smile, looked unhappy to take our beverage order, handed me and my husband 2 cookies, I then I told her, ""Can we just get pretzels?"" She said ""Then I need the cookies back."" I was honestly appalled."
Donna of Los Angeles, CA," Nov. 30, 2007","Don't deserve single star. Also, I have a flight from Chicago to Minneapolis 5 hours from now. And they have seats available on the earlier flight but won't give you without charging $75. They are ok to make you wait or fly a flight with empty seats but no customer delight which is no cost to them. No customer driven company and not looking for going extra mile to make customer happy. Never travel on American Airlines again."
Miriam of San Diego, CA," Nov. 29, 2007","Worst experience ever with AA never again, they treated my dad like garbage, they humiliated my dad in front of my niece travelling with him and in front of all passengers, just because my dad is ** and not fluent in English. I wish I could sue them for discrimination against my dad for not speaking English fluent instead of offering assistance in Spanish which, the sky harbor airport in Arizona has plenty of bilingual employees. DO NOT FLY AA EVER, pay more with a different airline. The only reason why my dad and niece flew AA to go to my brother's funeral, thank you AA for the worst day ever. It's a shame I have to put a star instead of no stars service."
Sean of Burnsville, MN," Nov. 28, 2007","This American Airlines review is out of frustration due to a lot of things. They're a disgrace! The employees are rude, there is no leg room, no entertainment, and treat people like herds of sheep. They have a ""New"" rule where they charge $50 at the gate to carry on your luggage. Are you kidding me? $50 for a carry on? And I can't even use the overhead bin! Disgraceful! Basically these guys are crooks! They're a disgrace. Last time I flew with American their flight was delayed by 2 hours and we ended up missing our connecting flight because it was the last flight out. We ended up having to stay an extra day and had to pay $100 for a hotel. We missed my sisters wedding. On the way back we ended up stuck on the tarmac for 2 hours. Of course!"

Shirley of Myakka City, FL," Sept. 19, 2007","I purchased the basic economy ticket. When I was getting ready to board in Charlotte, the attendant mentioned that this was a new program for your airline and that customers have stated it was cost effective. However, this was not my case! I paid nearly $600 to fly from Columbus, OH to Asheville, NC. Absolutely absurd!!! In the future, I will do all I can to avoid flying with your airline and don't count on a positive recommendation from me to others! Also, stop charging for the first piece of checked in luggage!"
Cesar of Englewood,," Sept. 14, 2007","I did a reservation with AA Sept 10, 2017 over the phone to Miami for Sept 12, 2017 in the flight # 1399. September 11 I checked the flight online and it was canceled. I called customer service. Patricia told me that I was wrong it wasn't cancel. I called at night again because I was worried I saw it was still cancel. After almost 2 hours they answered the phone. I told them what happened. They told me that they were very sorry but the flight was canceled and they didnt' have flight for Sept 12. They gave me 1 stop flight for Sept 13. "
Nayoung of Glenview, IL," Sept. 12, 2007","I was scheduled to fly out of Tampa International on Sunday, September, 17th to Durango, CO. I live in Sarasota, and just returned home the other day after evacuating for Hurricane Irma. I fled Florida and headed to Georgia, where I had to rent a hotel for a few nights. When I returned home I was fortunate enough not to have suffered damage. I of course have yard debris strewn about and I am still without power. The power company has estimated by the end of the day on September 22nd I will have power. With the extra costs incurred from having to leave my home, and the loss of power, I decided this was not a good time to travel."
Dionne of Avon Lake, OH," Sept. 11, 2007","Hurricane Irma was mess for AA. I get it. I'm sure there were thousands who were stuck trying to get their flights changed. Unfortunately, I was in Costa Rica with a connection via Miami and I got, as the AA agent said ""the short end of the stick."" I would be stuck almost another week in Costa Rica as everything AA had was booked out or cancelled. I saw a little bit of silver lining when I found that if I could get to Mexico city, I could fly home via DFW. However, AA would not change the ticket as it is against their rules to change the country of origin on a ticket. ""We cannot do it."" However, a more accurate description is ""will not."""
Timothy of Hagerstown, MD," Aug. 31, 2007","We were delayed on our AA out of Seattle due to having to wait on flight crew. Managed to make it to Dallas on time BUT had to sit on the tarmac for 20 mins waiting for a gait in order to deplane. This caused to miss our connecting flight. Next available flight is the next day. Asked about compensation for overnight hotel stay (there are 7 in our party, including a 3 year old) and were denied due to the delay being coded as weather related, which is absolutely bogus. So livid, frustrated, and tired at this point. Also found out AA has no number to call for complaints... You have to go through email so who knows if they will even read it or reply. Will never fly AA again if I can help it."
Jim of Santa Barbara, CA," Aug. 29, 2007","I was on an almost 2 hour flight (Flight AA3936) stuck sitting with one leg over my bag and the other on the edge of the aisle. Not once was I asked to check in my bag nor told it wouldn't fit on the overhead bin. By the time we landed my knees, hips and back were killing me and I had to have help from the gentleman next to me to be able to stand up. So glad there wasn't an emergency 'cause this would have been one hell of a hazard. Lesson learned not to use this airline again."
Kristina of Sag Harbor, NY," Aug. 29, 2007","American Airlines‰Û_the new standard for horrible service. Oh‰Û_I mean HORRIBLE! I travel very frequently for work and have stuck to one specific airline in order to build my status with them (ie. first class upgrades often, better seat choices, free checked bags). Recently, service has taken a turn for the worse. I‰Ûªm a reasonable guy and tolerate more than most. Call it my Southern hospitality, my upbringing or my service to the community when I served in law enforcement, but I just plain put up with more‰Û_until now."
Julia of Allen, TX," Aug. 18, 2007","I travel 80%~ for Work and have flown with almost every airline multiple times. AA is by far the worst. Not due to their customer service/staff/delays or anything like that (at least that I‰Ûªve noticed), but their planes have no entertainment system on each seat, they do not play movies on the overhead screens, and they don‰Ûªt even have a free WiFi movie/tv option you can connect to using your phone! I‰Ûªm currently on a flight from Boston to Phoenix and was utterly shocked when I sat in my seat and noticed no form of entertainment for a cross-country flight. Delta and other airlines provide personal entertainment screens on each screen or a smartphone connect feature for 2+ hr flights, which in turn make the flights more enjoyable. Anyways, to avoid rambling on and on about the lack of technology on AA planes I‰Ûªll just say if you enjoyed traveling in the late 90s early 2000s, then AA is for you. If you want to travel in 2017 and beyond, find a different airline."
Renee of Roland, AR," Aug. 8, 2007","I had a horrible experience today on my flight back to Miami. I have been an AAdvantage member for many years now and have always chosen to be loyal to American but after today's experience that may change. The onboarding process was fine and the flight was on time, which to be honest is rare but I was happy. When the snacks and beverage cart came the attendant did not smile, looked unhappy to take our beverage order, handed me and my husband 2 cookies, I then I told her, ""Can we just get pretzels?"" She said ""Then I need the cookies back."" I was honestly appalled."
Kathie of Aurora, IL," July 11, 2007","Don't deserve single star. Also, I have a flight from Chicago to Minneapolis 5 hours from now. And they have seats available on the earlier flight but won't give you without charging $75. They are ok to make you wait or fly a flight with empty seats but no customer delight which is no cost to them. No customer driven company and not looking for going extra mile to make customer happy. Never travel on American Airlines again."
Trevelyn of Oxon Hill, MD," July 5, 2007","Worst experience ever with AA never again, they treated my dad like garbage, they humiliated my dad in front of my niece travelling with him and in front of all passengers, just because my dad is ** and not fluent in English. I wish I could sue them for discrimination against my dad for not speaking English fluent instead of offering assistance in Spanish which, the sky harbor airport in Arizona has plenty of bilingual employees. DO NOT FLY AA EVER, pay more with a different airline. The only reason why my dad and niece flew AA to go to my brother's funeral, thank you AA for the worst day ever. It's a shame I have to put a star instead of no stars service."
Thomas of Alameda, CA," June 23, 2007","This American Airlines review is out of frustration due to a lot of things. They're a disgrace! The employees are rude, there is no leg room, no entertainment, and treat people like herds of sheep. They have a ""New"" rule where they charge $50 at the gate to carry on your luggage. Are you kidding me? $50 for a carry on? And I can't even use the overhead bin! Disgraceful! Basically these guys are crooks! They're a disgrace. Last time I flew with American their flight was delayed by 2 hours and we ended up missing our connecting flight because it was the last flight out. We ended up having to stay an extra day and had to pay $100 for a hotel. We missed my sisters wedding. On the way back we ended up stuck on the tarmac for 2 hours. Of course!"
Denise of Dallas, TX," June 19, 2007","I booked a ticket back when the hurricane were hitting down south every other week. Because of that I was not able to attend my trip in GA. They told me I had up to a year to use my ticket. So when I try to rebook my ticket they are now close to $500. Mind you this is the highest rate out of all the airlines for my particular dates, I asked for a refund because I didn't wanna double what I paid the first time and I was told by the Supervisor (Willie ** in Dallas ) that my only option was to ""use it or lost it"". Being a supervisor myself I thought the tone in which he said it was very careless and he didn't try to help the situation at all. I would never talk to my customers the way he spoke to me especially after losing out on $300!!"
Debra of Hartman, AR," June 8, 2007","I just completed a flight on American Airlines. I had read negative reviews, but I found the American Airlines people I had contact with were great, tried to provide all the service they could because our flight had been cancelled due WX and had to layover at ORD. My complaint is the phoney coupon given for a hotel room for a ""discounted rate"". The coupon has nothing to do with American Airlines, but is only a hotel booking service. When I called the phone number provided I was told the only available room was 10 miles away and given a rate of $80.00. It was getting late in the evening so took it. Then was advised there was a $15 service charge to book the room. American Airline paid none of this. The shuttle bus to the hotel was packed (Other delayed passengers). When I got home I checked the hotel rate and found the same room went for $105. I ""saved"" $10. The hotel was a Holiday Inn Express. Room not bad."

She made up some baloney about Homeland Security not letting people fly with spots on their passport. I told her I checked their website and there was no mention of anything like that. She then claimed, ""Oh, they don't tell you."" I said, ""Then how are you supposed to know?""

While I was away, I heard the news that my dad had passed away. In which, I contacted American Airlines right away and asked if anything can be done. I wanted to fly back before my actual trip date, due to obvious reasons. I even offered to provide them with a death certificate if need be (although, I don't think that is even something they should ask for right away). I spoke to 3 different customer service reps who were all horrible to speak with. They had zero compassion and empathy and just dismissed me as if what I was experiencing was far from a big deal to them. "
Michele of Barstow, CA," April 13, 2007","I was on the plane for 14 hours due to a delay. Sitting in a broken seat that would not recline. I told the stewardess and she could care less, said nothing she can do. After I got home I contacted the airline and they issued me a fourteen dollar credit. I had paid 197.34 dollars for preferred seats. The worst flight of my life, never again w/ this airline."
Robert of Winston Salem, NC," April 10, 2007","Overall, (Un)American Airlines continues to disappoint. I really only ever fly with AA as a last resort, and I can't see any reason to recommend traveling with AA. I was prior active duty Army, and now I'm a reservist, and only American Airlines makes me feel like my service is less important now. United, Southwest, Jet Blue, Delta, every other airline doesn't discriminate between Active Duty and Reserve/Guardsmen when it comes to bag fees. So, along with uncomfortable, outdated planes and poor service, I spent a $100 checking bags to and from my destination."
David of Cape Coral, FL," April 6, 2007",American Airlines is the worst airlines to fly anywhere. They cram you in the seats with no leg room or any room for that matter. I requested a wheelchair at airport and waited 30 minutes upon someone finally arriving. They took me the wrong way to my next check in and I missed my flight. They said I would have to rebook my ticket and just wait for the next flight. Attendant at the gate was very disrespectful and not helpful at all. I had no control over this situation at all. Not to mention when I did finally arrive at my destination that I requested a wheelchair prior to my departure.
Shepard of Washington, DC," April 6, 2007","American Airlines is the worst airline in THE WORLD, and should change their name, it is utterly disgraceful that as an American they use this name. Their policy is to not apologize for anything, to be as rude as possible to people who are basically held hostage to them and their BS policies like closing the door to the gate while people are standing there then charging them money to rebook their flight, not caring at all about the bags on their way to a destination without the owners there to pick them up. Then being told when lodging a complaint that it was going in one ear and out the other. I have never been treated so poorly in my life, I will never again fly with this airline, I hope they go bankrupt and get the worst karma life can give. Oh yeah and I get to fly with them tomorrow. :/"
James of Falls Church, VA," April 1, 2007","Very disappointed. Unlikely I will ever choose American Airlines again. I didn't make my flight in the spring. I was given a voucher to use for future travel. Now I'm being told I can only use it myself, and not for my family. I don't want to use it for myself. What difference does it make? I'm being told different things by different people. The last guy hung up on me and I wasn't even rude to him. This is how AA does business? All I want is to not be penalized for cancelling a flight that was beyond my control. If you have a voucher it should be flexible to use for anyone. AA is the WORST! Hope they go out of business for this nonsense. Airline travel is a joke."
Aurora of Euless, TX," March 27, 2007","American Airlines canceled my 92-year-old father-in-law's flight to Key West due to Hurricane Irma. On that day American Airline was contacted and the representative said there would be no problem re-booking, just use the reference number. American Airlines even went on TV and said they would waive re-booking fees. Today when calling to re-book the flight and after 57 minutes on the phone, I was told the flight could not be re-booked because it was in their notes I requested a refund. At no time did I request a refund and American Airlines could not locate any record of a refund request. Even so, American Airlines still insisted they could not re-book the flight or issue a refund. If we did not have enough trouble dealing with a Cat 4 hurricane and its devastating aftermath, now American Airlines is adding to the misery. All my father-in-law wants is to come to Key West and see that everyone is alright. Thanks, AA."
Charlene of Surfside Besch, SC," March 26, 2007",I bought tickets for my mother in law and son to meet my wife and I in Colorado. We had traveled on different airlines due to connections and therefore were going back on different airlines. My wife and I left on our airplane. My mother in law and son were stranded as the plane had a mechanical. This was 8 AM and the bottom line was it didn't get fixed that day. American gave them a 12.00 voucher good in the terminal and did nothing to get them a room as the rooms they usually used weren't available.
M. of West Hartford, CT," March 19, 2007","I booked 2 separate flights on American Airlines in Economy since I pay for my air travel. On one they pre-assigned me a back-of-plane middle seat and said that I was required to pay some increased fee for window, aisle or closer to the front. On the second flight they said I have to wait until I reach the boarding gate for any seat. This is ridiculous and unacceptable. The airline has sufficient revenue to - just a suggestion - increase the ""base"" fare to cover a first-come-first-served seat selection and not put everyone into 3rd class or worse status. If they want to surcharge certain premium seats, like middle seats toward the front, that's OK, but this behavior is totally unacceptable and I refuse to fly them (or any airline) that abuses their passengers."
Kelly of Auburn, NY," March 18, 2007",Well I looked into changing my flight for my fiance and I to go home a day earlier... only to discover that American charges $200.00 a ticket PLUS the difference in price tickets! LIKE THAT IS GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE! So for the price of another ticket I can change my flight! I will be looking elsewhere for flights in the future. I have already paid for a flight and now you are trying to rip me off even more!?! Out of touch and terrible service to a customer of over 5 years. I will be going elsewhere where I don't get bent over the table. Thank you American!

I was informed by two customer service representatives that I would be able to rebook my flight to Miami with no additional charges in fare and no change fees. Of course, when it comes time to book my flight, I'm informed about a change fee. I told the agent, I was reassured twice that I would not be charged any additional fees because my initial cancellation was weather related. "

Annette of Lubbock, TX," March 13, 2007",My husband and I were scheduled to fly out at 7:15 am to go to California for a very important family matter. We do not live near the airport so we were up early to make sure we were early and nothing could go wrong. But things did go wrong. When we got to the airport we went and printed out tickets at the self checkout. We did notice that it mentioned no overhead storage for our carry on bags. So confused because we fly a lot and there is always overhead storage or they place in under the cabin. So we asked a lady that was standing in the area of self print and she looked and our tickets said we would be fine... Again we were told wrong.
Shawn of Fishkill, NY," March 7, 2007","On September 4 my family of 5 arrived at the airport in Anchorage to fly home to Toronto via Dallas. Four of us had carry-on sized luggage but one had a mid-sized suitcase that we knew we would have to check. Our flight to Toronto included a 12.5-hour connection at DFW (not by choice). Since none of us sleep well on planes, we were considering going to a hotel following the overnight flight to DFW. When checking the suitcase, I specifically asked the American Airlines agent ""if we only check this bag to DFW and then go to a hotel for a few hours of sleep, will we be charged a second baggage fee to check the bag in for the flight to Toronto? If so we can rearrange the bags so that we can just check it through to Toronto."" "

Ernesto of Killeen, TX," Nov. 29, 2006","I was on the plane for 14 hours due to a delay. Sitting in a broken seat that would not recline. I told the stewardess and she could care less, said nothing she can do. After I got home I contacted the airline and they issued me a fourteen dollar credit. I had paid 197.34 dollars for preferred seats. The worst flight of my life, never again w/ this airline."
Patrick of Abu Dhabi, OTHER," Nov. 29, 2006","Overall, (Un)American Airlines continues to disappoint. I really only ever fly with AA as a last resort, and I can't see any reason to recommend traveling with AA. I was prior active duty Army, and now I'm a reservist, and only American Airlines makes me feel like my service is less important now. United, Southwest, Jet Blue, Delta, every other airline doesn't discriminate between Active Duty and Reserve/Guardsmen when it comes to bag fees. So, along with uncomfortable, outdated planes and poor service, I spent a $100 checking bags to and from my destination."
Jonna of Oak Park, IL," Nov. 10, 2006",American Airlines is the worst airlines to fly anywhere. They cram you in the seats with no leg room or any room for that matter. I requested a wheelchair at airport and waited 30 minutes upon someone finally arriving. They took me the wrong way to my next check in and I missed my flight. They said I would have to rebook my ticket and just wait for the next flight. Attendant at the gate was very disrespectful and not helpful at all. I had no control over this situation at all. Not to mention when I did finally arrive at my destination that I requested a wheelchair prior to my departure.
Cissy of Rancho Santa Fe, CA," Nov. 6, 2006","American Airlines is the worst airline in THE WORLD, and should change their name, it is utterly disgraceful that as an American they use this name. Their policy is to not apologize for anything, to be as rude as possible to people who are basically held hostage to them and their BS policies like closing the door to the gate while people are standing there then charging them money to rebook their flight, not caring at all about the bags on their way to a destination without the owners there to pick them up. Then being told when lodging a complaint that it was going in one ear and out the other. I have never been treated so poorly in my life, I will never again fly with this airline, I hope they go bankrupt and get the worst karma life can give. Oh yeah and I get to fly with them tomorrow. :/"
Stanley of Waltham, MA," Dec. 31, 2004","Very disappointed. Unlikely I will ever choose American Airlines again. I didn't make my flight in the spring. I was given a voucher to use for future travel. Now I'm being told I can only use it myself, and not for my family. I don't want to use it for myself. What difference does it make? I'm being told different things by different people. The last guy hung up on me and I wasn't even rude to him. This is how AA does business? All I want is to not be penalized for cancelling a flight that was beyond my control. If you have a voucher it should be flexible to use for anyone. AA is the WORST! Hope they go out of business for this nonsense. Airline travel is a joke."
Rhonda of Waldorf, MD," Dec. 28, 2004","American Airlines canceled my 92-year-old father-in-law's flight to Key West due to Hurricane Irma. On that day American Airline was contacted and the representative said there would be no problem re-booking, just use the reference number. American Airlines even went on TV and said they would waive re-booking fees. Today when calling to re-book the flight and after 57 minutes on the phone, I was told the flight could not be re-booked because it was in their notes I requested a refund. At no time did I request a refund and American Airlines could not locate any record of a refund request. Even so, American Airlines still insisted they could not re-book the flight or issue a refund. If we did not have enough trouble dealing with a Cat 4 hurricane and its devastating aftermath, now American Airlines is adding to the misery. All my father-in-law wants is to come to Key West and see that everyone is alright. Thanks, AA."
Amanda of Summit, NJ," Dec. 27, 2004",I bought tickets for my mother in law and son to meet my wife and I in Colorado. We had traveled on different airlines due to connections and therefore were going back on different airlines. My wife and I left on our airplane. My mother in law and son were stranded as the plane had a mechanical. This was 8 AM and the bottom line was it didn't get fixed that day. American gave them a 12.00 voucher good in the terminal and did nothing to get them a room as the rooms they usually used weren't available.
Chuck of Dillsburg, PA," Dec. 26, 2004","I booked 2 separate flights on American Airlines in Economy since I pay for my air travel. On one they pre-assigned me a back-of-plane middle seat and said that I was required to pay some increased fee for window, aisle or closer to the front. On the second flight they said I have to wait until I reach the boarding gate for any seat. This is ridiculous and unacceptable. The airline has sufficient revenue to - just a suggestion - increase the ""base"" fare to cover a first-come-first-served seat selection and not put everyone into 3rd class or worse status. If they want to surcharge certain premium seats, like middle seats toward the front, that's OK, but this behavior is totally unacceptable and I refuse to fly them (or any airline) that abuses their passengers."
Tatiana of West New York, NJ," Jan. 5, 2004",Well I looked into changing my flight for my fiance and I to go home a day earlier... only to discover that American charges $200.00 a ticket PLUS the difference in price tickets! LIKE THAT IS GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE! So for the price of another ticket I can change my flight! I will be looking elsewhere for flights in the future. I have already paid for a flight and now you are trying to rip me off even more!?! Out of touch and terrible service to a customer of over 5 years. I will be going elsewhere where I don't get bent over the table. Thank you American!
Bob of Mililani, HI," Dec. 30, 2003","I originally booked my flight to Miami from Washington, DC back in July 2017. I was scheduled to fly September 13-18, 2017. I, like many, had to cancel my trip because of hurricane Irma. I was informed by two customer service representatives that I would be able to rebook my flight to Miami with no additional charges in fare and no change fees. Of course, when it comes time to book my flight, I'm informed about a change fee. I told the agent, I was reassured twice that I would not be charged any additional fees because my initial cancellation was weather related. "
Mel of Mission, KS," Dec. 19, 2003","American Airlines is full of **. Our cruise was cancelled due to Hurricane Irma. It was beyond our control and the airline stated there was nothing that they could do. No partial credit, changes or anything! I will not be flying with them anymore!"
John of Austin, TX," Dec. 9, 2003",My husband and I were scheduled to fly out at 7:15 am to go to California for a very important family matter. We do not live near the airport so we were up early to make sure we were early and nothing could go wrong. But things did go wrong. When we got to the airport we went and printed out tickets at the self checkout. We did notice that it mentioned no overhead storage for our carry on bags. So confused because we fly a lot and there is always overhead storage or they place in under the cabin. So we asked a lady that was standing in the area of self print and she looked and our tickets said we would be fine... Again we were told wrong.
Robert of Garden City, NY," Dec. 9, 2003","On September 4 my family of 5 arrived at the airport in Anchorage to fly home to Toronto via Dallas. Four of us had carry-on sized luggage but one had a mid-sized suitcase that we knew we would have to check. Our flight to Toronto included a 12.5-hour connection at DFW (not by choice). Since none of us sleep well on planes, we were considering going to a hotel following the overnight flight to DFW. When checking the suitcase, I specifically asked the American Airlines agent ""if we only check this bag to DFW and then go to a hotel for a few hours of sleep, will we be charged a second baggage fee to check the bag in for the flight to Toronto? If so we can rearrange the bags so that we can just check it through to Toronto."" "
Steve of Torrance, CA," Dec. 5, 2003","I purchased the basic economy ticket. When I was getting ready to board in Charlotte, the attendant mentioned that this was a new program for your airline and that customers have stated it was cost effective. However, this was not my case! I paid nearly $600 to fly from Columbus, OH to Asheville, NC. Absolutely absurd!!! In the future, I will do all I can to avoid flying with your airline and don't count on a positive recommendation from me to others! Also, stop charging for the first piece of checked in luggage!"
Jacqueline of North Bergen, NJ," Nov. 28, 2003","I did a reservation with AA Sept 10, 2017 over the phone to Miami for Sept 12, 2017 in the flight # 1399. September 11 I checked the flight online and it was canceled. I called customer service. Patricia told me that I was wrong it wasn't cancel. I called at night again because I was worried I saw it was still cancel. After almost 2 hours they answered the phone. I told them what happened. They told me that they were very sorry but the flight was canceled and they didnt' have flight for Sept 12. They gave me 1 stop flight for Sept 13. "
Jennifer of Plantation, FL," Nov. 25, 2003","I was scheduled to fly out of Tampa International on Sunday, September, 17th to Durango, CO. I live in Sarasota, and just returned home the other day after evacuating for Hurricane Irma. I fled Florida and headed to Georgia, where I had to rent a hotel for a few nights. When I returned home I was fortunate enough not to have suffered damage. I of course have yard debris strewn about and I am still without power. The power company has estimated by the end of the day on September 22nd I will have power. With the extra costs incurred from having to leave my home, and the loss of power, I decided this was not a good time to travel."
Elizabeth of Mililani, HI," Oct. 8, 2003","Hurricane Irma was mess for AA. I get it. I'm sure there were thousands who were stuck trying to get their flights changed. Unfortunately, I was in Costa Rica with a connection via Miami and I got, as the AA agent said ""the short end of the stick."" I would be stuck almost another week in Costa Rica as everything AA had was booked out or cancelled. I saw a little bit of silver lining when I found that if I could get to Mexico city, I could fly home via DFW. However, AA would not change the ticket as it is against their rules to change the country of origin on a ticket. ""We cannot do it."" However, a more accurate description is ""will not."""
Kayo of Kirkland, WA," Sept. 28, 2003","We were delayed on our AA out of Seattle due to having to wait on flight crew. Managed to make it to Dallas on time BUT had to sit on the tarmac for 20 mins waiting for a gait in order to deplane. This caused to miss our connecting flight. Next available flight is the next day. Asked about compensation for overnight hotel stay (there are 7 in our party, including a 3 year old) and were denied due to the delay being coded as weather related, which is absolutely bogus. So livid, frustrated, and tired at this point. Also found out AA has no number to call for complaints... You have to go through email so who knows if they will even read it or reply. Will never fly AA again if I can help it."
