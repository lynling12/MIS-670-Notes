"Lousy Italian food with extremely poor service.', ""Don't bother- better places to go."
"What a major disappointment.', ""Lydia is my Wife's favorite TV food personality so we were greatly looking forward to our meal here. This restaurant is so different from the personality that you see on TV it is difficult to comprehend. While the TV Lydia is casual, friendly, homey and even a bit rustic, this restaurant is snooty, anal and pompous."", u'The wait staff is from some parallel Nazi universe. They all looked like frightened animals scurrying about. I have never been so ignored in a restaurant. When the waiter initially asked us if we ""wanted anything from the bar"" he spoke directly to my wife, then myself, then walked away, completely ignoring my son. \xa0We were sitting in the central dining room, where there were, at most, 10 tables and all of the staff needed to pass thru to get from the kitchen to all the other spaces. We had to flag down a different waiter each time we needed or wanted something.', 'Unfortunately the food was not able to save the pathetic service. My wife ordered the pasta with mushrooms and truffles. The pasta was far from al-dente to the point of being mushy and the mushrooms overwhelmed the truffle. My son had the chicken mozzarella. It looked like a deconstructed chicken parm and consisted of three bite sized medallions of chicken with a small slice of mozzarella on top of each. His main dish looked like a nice sized appetizer. His actual appetizer was the only decent dish of the meal, but then how hard is it to slice some prosciutto? My octopus appetizer was underwhelming. At lease the veal in my main course of vitello tonnato was cooked excellently. Unfortunately the dish was overwhelmed by shavings of hard, raw artichoke.', 'The waiter screwed up our desert order and forgot my limoncello order. Which was all for the better because we could leave quicker."
"I went there with my girlfriend on Valentine's Day evening for their set course meal set at $120 per person. We were seated 15 minutes after our reservation time but at one of the three tables in the waiting area!! I have been to this restaurant several times in the past few years, and I don't recall having tables at the waiting area. The result was, I was sitting there for over 3 hours watching bunch of people waiting and standing within a feet from my table. Sometimes I felt like the crowd was watching me eat. It was as if I was eating in the waiting area of a popular but crowded Chinese dim sum restaurant! It was very uncomfortable."", 'Then the wait: how can a 3-course meal last for over 3 hours?! Our waitress came in and out and did not even take our orders until 30 to 40 minutes later. In fact, the person who actually took our order was the manager, it seemed. Some people who sat down much later than we did got their main course and finished it before we finish our appetizer. No, my girlfriend and I were not slow eaters!', 'The dessert...oh wait, the waitress brought my check...before my dessert even arrived?! She did apologize, but if the restaurant was charging $120 per person for a meal, it should make sure that its service was at that level and that it was not under-staff.Despite many people waiting, it took another 20 minutes or so before I could get a manager to give me my check. The night was supposed to be fun and romantic, and customers paid the price for that experience, but clearly, the restaurant did not deliver that night.', ""My feeling was not unique. The table right next to us had the same feeling: if everyone in the restaurant was paying the same price per person that night, why did we get an inferior seating area (the waiting area), and why we were not told such was the case at the time of the reservation?! Also, while the food quality was okay, why was our service so bad on a Valentine's night? This was simply unfair treatment. I hope this had nothing to do with the fact that both me and my girlfriend were Asians. I paid 10% tips at the end just to be polite, but I really thought even 10% was way too much."", ""As a side note, my girlfriend was harassed some months ago on the subway where a guy secretly (or not so secretly) took multiple pictures of her using his cell phone. She went up to him, took a picture of him, and demanded that he erase those pictures. The passengers nearby also saw how he took those pictures and asked him to delete them, but he denied that he did. In fact, he told her in response that she was a very beautiful woman. The nearby-passengers and my girlfriend got into a verbal fight with him. At the end, my girlfriend went to a police station and filed a report. The punchline: one of the people who picked up the dirty dishes from the table that night was this guy!! My girlfriend double-checked at least twice. She left the place in fear. While I don't expect the restaurant to do a background check on all its employees, how comfortable would you be if you know someone working there sexually harassed women."", ""Given this situation, I don't think I will ever come back to this restaurant or recommend it to anyone."
"I don't get it, I just don't get it !!!!!! \xa0My exasperation with the restaurant compounds by the minute. \xa0So this was my third and final visit and I will never go back. \xa0The experience I recently had is exactly the same as my three previous ones. \xa0The service was arrogant and slow. \xa0The food was mediocre at best ( Salad: underdressed vegetables that were in the field a day too long, Pasta: Rigtoni with tomato sauce and ricotta,good not great: Flat Iron Steak, flavorless."", u""I must admit the second time I was there I had the taglitelle with duck ragu that was magnificient, but that was the exception when it should be the rule at such a marqee restaurant. \xa0I mentioned this was my third time there: a colleague of mine loves this place, so when invited, I go. \xa0I'm not sure if he or the others who rate Felidia so highly are eating the same food I am? \xa0The next time we have an outing there, I will decline."", ""I'm sorry Lidia, I loved watching your cooking show as a kid, and I wanted to love your restaurant, but I just can't."
"This place was unfortunately NOT worth the $110 per person we spent here.', u'We got the 5-course vegetarian tasting menu. First course was a beet salad tossed in some citrus and served with mustard seeds and blue cheese (good if not a little bland); second and third courses were pear and pecorino-filled ravioli (too sweet) and candele pasta with rosemary, spicy tomato, and ricotta (delicious); then came a farm egg and spaghetti squash entree (egg a bit cold). \xa0""Pre-dessert"" was a mocha ice cream dusted with coffee powder (tasty); dessert was poached pear with vanilla ice cream and candied cranberries (unexciting).', u'Service was SLOPPY. \xa0Servers were more concerned with talking about baseball (even turning over $5 to a colleague over a lost bet) than providing attentive service. \xa0Conversation was loud amongst the servers, and we felt like an afterthought throughout the entire evening. \xa0The ""busser"" was the only one who cared enough to bring us a new basket of bread, refill our waters, etc.', 'Overall, the food was all right but the sad state of the service we received was what killed our experience at Felidia. We do not intend to return if things remain the way they are."
"Full disclosure, the food is great, quite delicious.', 'But here\'s the thing. I\'ve gone there several times with large groups, often 9 or more, and had no problem. Today I tried to make a reservation for a group of 8, and they tell me that our only choice is to used a fixed price menu of $90 per person, not including alcohol, gratuity, tax. When pressed on the matter, they tell me that this is their policy for groups of 8 or more because the kitchen can\'t support a large group with the regular menu. Which from previous experience I know to be untrue. I\'m used to being gouged in Midtown, but this is absurd. I asked to speak to a manager, then the person on the phone flippantly said ""do you want to make a reservation or not?"" Tired of this nonsense, I declined. He hung up on me.', ""Get real Felidia. You used to be great, but I'm not willing to pay extra for arrogance."
Will not return. Terrible service. Terrible food. Just an overall bad experience.
"Service can spoil and outweigh the food and in the case of Felidia the service was so abominably bad I would absolutely under no circumstance ever EVER go back there.', u'I have never seen so many people working, seemingly feverishly at a restaurant while at the same time maintaining a consistent level of utmost incapability. \xa0There was literally not one thing they could do right.', u'I rarely write a one star review ever, and planned to write a 2 star review BUT the whole mess that occurred after paying the bill just really threw me over the edge. \xa0The lackluster apologies of the manager (or so i think he was not sure) in combination with his stumbling and overall creepy demeanor just made his apology process so much worse. \xa0In addition, he tried to blame poor service and the almost 2 hours it took to get our entrees on a ""backed up kitchen"" but this was most surely a lie because everybody around us got their food in a timely manner. \xa0Don\'t lie seriously do you think we are that dumb? \xa0Did he comp us anything on our meal you may ask (especially with the prices they charge) ... NO!', 'The food was pretty good but not amazing and most certainly not good enough to ignore how utterly incompetent the staff are.', 'Felidia you seem like a real nice lady on TV, but your restaurant is awful.', u""P.s. as a souvenir to this lovely meal the guy tried to make it up to us by giving us her latest cookbook. \xa0We looked inside on the way home and saw the book cover was totally torn up. \xa0Thanks for giving us some crap you couldn't sell!!"
"After several years of anticipation, we finally were able to dine at Felidia. \xa0It's a busy place. Our seating on the second floor was clearly to far away from the kitchen. Everything comes up or down the stairs. The wine cellar is on four. \xa0When we could get the attention of the wait, bus, wine staff they did their brisk best to take care of us. Sometimes this can be ok. Like when the food is good. \xa0The pasta, probably great when it left the kitchen, was Stoney cold. Our shared plates were grudgingly delivered without utensils. \xa0Our request to clear the bread service went unheralded. \xa0No one bothered to take our coats. \xa0We ordered the mixed seafood grill. \xa0It was overcooked to the point that we could not extract the meat from the shell. \xa0 It's hard to choose the worst default. \xa0Failure to deliver what the kitchen was capable of or simply asking way to much of what the space and staff could handle. \xa0Good seafood delivered competently to the table does not happen here. \xa0So sad."
"The fish soup here is the best. The best. I can have it as an app, I can split it as a full blown meal with a friend.', 'I can have it in a box with a fox... etc. It is so wonderful, it tastes like the drippings of roasted fish my mama always makes, plus more. Savory, just the right hit of salt, and a lingering, tender loving sweetness. ', 'The service could not be more to my liking, every server here is a sensai. Getting me more bread, pouring me wine, folding my napkin when I leave the table. My heart could not beat louder in excitment when looking at their wonderful wine list.', ""I don't come here often because it's beyond expensive, but whenever I do it feels like a dream. It makes me salivate thinking about their fish soup right now. I think I'm going to cry. Actually, Esca fish soup is the tears of angels."", 'Bury me in Esca fish soup!"
An all time favorite! \xa0Best seafood and superior service!!
"Tuesday evening...party of 2', 'Plain and simple...one of the best meals my husband and I have ever eaten.', u""We came here because we couldn't wedge ourselves into Batali's Babbo with a shoehorn! \xa0I am so glad we came to this place, though."", u'Love, love, loved the meal start to finish. \xa0Celebs are on to this place, too, which made for some interesting dinner viewing. \xa0I kept my camera in check and did not start snapping away like a freak stalker.', ""Loved sitting in the out door patio listening to the NYC street sounds of Hell's Kitchen... seriously, it was nice. :)"", u'We will be back...loved it \xa0Mario!!"
Awesome.
"Since it was our last night in New York City, and the 4th of July we weighed our options. \xa0Walk down to FDR and watch the fireworks, or dine at Esca. \xa0We hear the fireworks are absolutely amazing, but we decided to go to Esca. \xa0Hey, I can see fireworks anytime...right? \xa0', u""Well let's just say we made the right decision. \xa0As my wife and I were sitting at our cozy table enjoying a cold Toasted Lager and a refreshing Pinot Grigio, I noticed it was pouring outside. \xa0Chalk another one up for Esca. \xa0Restaurant is very inviting and cozy. \xa0Although many of the tables were close together, I never felt like my space or conversations were intruded upon by my neighbors. \xa0It also helped that they were cranking out some tunes. \xa0The Police, Michael Jackson, Led Zeppelin and more. \xa0"", u'Finally the food started to arrive. \xa0We were pleasantly greeted with an amuse bouche. \xa0It was a simple, clean presentation of two crostini of white beans, herbs, anchovies and olive oil. \xa0Olives were also placed on the table. \xa0Simply divine!', u""Next came the Mahi-Mahi crudo. \xa0If you aren't familiar with crudo, think raw fish dressed with olive oil and sea salt. \xa0This is the only time I have ever had Mahi-Mahi off of the Hawaiian islands. \xa0It did not fail to please. \xa0Excellent. \xa0"", u'We decided to split our pasta course. \xa0Ricotta-filled gnocchi with buffalo mozzarella in a simple red sauce topped with basil. \xa0The gnocchi looked like little pillows, and felt as equally soft in our mouths. \xa0This was to die for, and a must try when you visit. \xa0', u'Next up was our fish course. \xa0I had the snapper and my wife had the halibut. \xa0Both were seasoned perfectly, and were quite excellent. \xa0Although we both regretted not getting a whole fish, simply for the fact that they fillet it at a table that they have located in the center of the restaurant. \xa0Very cool.', u'We finished off our evening having a chocolate cake with espresso ice cream. \xa0It was a perfect ending to a great dining experience. \xa0Next time you are in NYC, I highly recommend this place."
"FABULOUS AND AMAZING! \xa0The service was wonderful and our waiter was extraordinarily knowledgeable about the wine list. \xa0We decided to be adventurous and ordered the chef's tasting menu for the table. \xa0Each course was served with a description of what we were about to eat (I felt like a Top Chef judge) and although I NEVER would have ordered some of the items independently, they were delicious beyond belief. \xa0We went after a matinee and had the luxury of enjoying every bite without feeling rushed. \xa0Another bonus: \xa0gluten-free dietary adjustments \xa0were easily made by the chef."
"This is one of my favorite restaurants in the world. Our waiter was exceedingly kind, helpful, and polite. His recommendations were excellent, and he was also a knowledgeable sommelier. The best part was the crudo, or raw fish prepared Italian-style, the Italian answer to sushi. WOW. I just loved the crudo tasting. We also had a great salad, and some lobster pasta which was very delicious, but we were glad we shared it because it is a heavy dish. If you like simple fish, Italian food, and raw fish, this is your place."
"wow. mario, i know why you're a fatty."", ""i did the tasting menu + wine. it was one of the best meals i've ever had in my life."", 'the crudo (italian sashimi) was so fresh and buttery. i did the tasting menu with two other friends so each of us got different crudo (which we shared). everything was so fresh, delicious, and just the right portion. the wine was amazing with each dish. the service was fantastic. ', 'this place exceeded my expectation. ', ""it's 8AM and i ate about 12 hours ago. I think i still have food coma."
"I mean...it's a Mario Batalli restaurant! \xa0It was incredible!! \xa0We went before seeing the Book of Mormon (another 5 star review by the way) and were absolutely blown away. \xa0I was unable to partake in the crudo (Italian sashimi) unfortunately, as I am pregnant, but everything else was absolute perfection! \xa0The wine list is incredible (hey, I pick and choose what I can and cannot have while I'm pregnant!) and we had a delicious rose, which I had never had before (don't worry, I only had 1 glass!) and found both delicious and refreshing! \xa0The appetizers were amazing, the pasta was perfections, but the branzino! \xa0Well, it was simply out of this world, to die for, incredible!!! \xa0Best fish, I've ever had in my life. \xa0Hands down. \xa0It comes crusted in salt and they crack the salt off and fillet and de-bone the fish right in front of you. \xa0It adds so so much to the dining experience. \xa0They then drizzle it with a Sicilian olive oil, which is really the perfect finishing touch. \xa0I was just squealing with happiness! \xa0The desert was incredible too, we had a banana pudding and a rhubarb tart with buttermilk gelato and both were incredible! \xa0The service was more than fantastic. \xa0We basically let our server order for us, and everything he picked was absolute perfection! \xa0It is the absolute perfect place to go before a show as it's walking distance to the theatre district. \xa0My husband even saw Katherine McPhee outside the restaurant! \xa0Loved it!"
this place has the best blue fin tuna. it was advise to me that they do not have it often how ever when they do have it OMG. have to try their blue fin tune toro. best ever.
Italian sushi! \xa0It was my first and best crudo experience. \xa0I'd go back if my cousin was still a sous-chef there.
"Two of my favorite things to eat... sashimi and pasta. \xa0Well, here at Esca, I can have the best of both worlds! \xa0Mario Batali has weaved in an amazing crudo (Italian sashimi) menu at Esca along w/ the more traditional italian / Mediterranean fare. \xa0The crudo menu portion is along worth the visit. \xa0My mouth was watering as I read each item... oysters, bay scallops, fluke, hamachi, bluefin tuna, etc... \xa0When I was finally able to move on to the other side of the menu, I was pleased to see a great selection of appetizers, pastas, and main entrees. \xa0With all the choices, I was somewhat overwhelmed. \xa0Well, our waiter to the rescue. \xa0Not only did he provide good, professional service, but I must credit him for recommending some excellent dishes. \xa0All of his choices were spot on.', u""My 2 friends and I decided to share everything (love family style, esp at restaurants i'm checking out for the first time). \xa0We started w/ 2 crudo: bay scallops (super fresh and delicious) and medium fatty blue fin toro with just the right amount of olive oil, herbs, and a sprinkling of some nice sea salt which provided a nice slight crunch to the fish. \xa0We then had fried freshwater eel for apps... nice batter (not too oily)... never had eel like this before. \xa0The next dish was one of the best pasta dishes i've ever had! \xa0Just thinking about it is making me hungry... maccheroni alla chitarra. \xa0This was divine... perfectly house-made thick pasta noodles with sea urchin and crabmeat. \xa0I would've never thought uni would go well w/ pasta... who knew that it's actually a marriage made in culinary heaven. \xa0The uni provided a great texture and a bit of sweetness... the buttery flavor with the pasta and small chunks of crab was delicious... and surprisingly, not that heavy. \xa0For our main meal, we had a lovely black cod; good but paled in comparison to the secondi pasta dish. \xa0Also could not help but take the waiter's recommendation for the lemon cake dessert -- another winner. \xa0I can honestly say that everything I ate that night tasted good to great. \xa0Rare that I'm completely satisfied with every dish but I was! \xa0"", u""The interior is not all that interesting but it's comfortable. \xa0The focus here is on the food and that's where my focus was for most of the night. \xa0Definitely will be going back for some more crudo and the pasta."
"Esca is one of the best restaurants owned by Food Network chef - Mario Batali. When someone else is picking up the tab - the experience is that much better!\r', 'The crudo appetizers are a must - if you are splurging - go for the crudo tasting, otherwise go with whatever is special that day or pick from the delicious Black Bass, Tuna, Hamachi, well any of them!\r', ""For pasta courses, the spaghetti with lobster, chili and mint are amazing!The spaghetti neri and bigoli (a Tuscan thick style spaghetti) are both great dishes - it's almost too hard to choose.\r"", ""For the secondi, I would always recommend the Branzino for two - it's so classically Italian. The other fish dishes are all incredible - I've never seen such huge cuts of sea bass! You simply can't go wrong with this menu.\r"", ""In terms of wine selection it's just a matter of narrowing down the list - this is an exhaustive list of regional wines from all over Italy. Since Joe Bastianich is also involved and has his own vineyard in Friuli, there is an incredible focus on lesser known wines from producers that are perfectly suited to the menu. The sommelier is so helpful - don't be afraid to ask for suggestions.\r"", 'Esca is an incredible destination - especially for fish lovers."
"My husband and I both loved this place! We shared a squid ink spaghetti that was fabulous, then we each had entrees that were great. I had a sampler of the crudo, which was wonderful - fresh and unique. My husband had the monkfish and it was also very, very good. The service was prompt and very attentive, and it was a lovely cozy spot. The best part? I was surprised by the bill! We both had wine and the bill was still under $140. It was expensive by our student standards, but I have been so many other places where I paid more and got a lot less out of it. I would gladly come back here anytime!"
"i'm a bit biased since i love seafood."", u'i visited this place with a few co-workers, and we were all wowed by this place. \xa0', u""it's a good place for a work expense dinner, and there are plenty of suits around you. \xa0lupa's casual, but esca's a bit more upscale."", u'recommendations: crudo appetizer and lobster spagetti. \xa0great wine list."
"This is some of the best Italian food I have ever had. \xa0I'm not a big pasta-person and prefer Mediterranean-Italian, so Esca was right up my alley. \xa0The food and service were superb. \xa0Our waiter was very attentive and knowledgeable. \xa0The unique dishes were flavorful and divine. \xa0I will definitely be back soon."
I came here for Christmas lunch last year with my colleagues. I liked the atmosphere of the restaurant very much. It's bright and comfortable. The servers are professional and formal. Food of every one looked very good and mine was yummy. Sorry I can't tell more since I've been there only once. But overall experience was great.
"LOVED this place! My hubby and I came here for lunch, and the experience was fabulous. We had fantastic food, and the waiter suggested a fantastic Rosato that helped cool my mouth during a gloriously spicy meal. I also had a great Valpolicella for dessert. So sorry for those of you who had bad experiences...Give it a second chance!"
"This place is awesome. \xa0Expensive, but awesome. \xa0The food was excellent, particularly the halibut on the tasting menu. \xa0The service was impeccable, helpful, friendly, and not overbearing."
I wish I didn't arrive here semi-full already. The food here is fantastic and the waitstaff very attentive. We sat in the back room in a corner table that was quite intimate for a bustling restaurant. I loved our charcuterie board and my boyfriend couldn't get enough of the peanut butter and beets. I soooo wanted to eat more but just couldn't fit it!
"I had a birthday there and loved it. \xa0First off, Dave Pasternack is a cool guy. \xa0He is a good long island fishing guy who really knows fish in an unpretentious way. \xa0I wound up talking to him at the table about fishing for about 1/2 hour. \xa0Please see the excellent New Yorker article about him from last year for more detail. \xa0His food is excellent and inventive. \xa0The crudo thing is a bit overated as a concept but it's still very tasty. \xa0The tasting menu for 8 was one of the more expensive checks I have ever seen but it was a memorable meal. \xa0The sommelier was excellent as well (a Batali trademark)."
"another meal that makes me want to chronicle every bite -- but their menu changes every day so it wouldn't do much good! \xa0still, i will list the highlights:"", u'1) the yellowfin tuna carpaccio: oh. \xa0my. \xa0god. \xa0it was so so so good. \xa0i absolutely ADORE raw tuna, and this was some of the best raw tuna i have ever had.', u'2) the grilled baby octopus: not recommended for anyone who gets squeamish when their food looks like what it actually is, given the body and little legs were laid out on the plate like a baby octopus would be, but it was really delicious. \xa0sorry, little baby octopus!', u'3) the maccheroni (i didn\'t misspell that, it\'s the way they had it on the menu) with sea urchin: another ""oh. my. god."" dish. \xa0it was amazing. \xa0and split three ways it was the perfect amount of pasta, since we also had main entrees on the way.', u""4) the scallops: i wish i had ordered them. \xa0i had a bite of my dad's and they were wonderful -- succulent, sweet, tender but still firm... mmm delish."", u""5) our waiter: he was great! \xa0other reviewers have complained about bad service, but we all agreed that it was some of the best service we've had in a long while. \xa0he was friendly, attentive without being pushy, really helpful in picking out two (very tasty) bottles of wine... i mean, my entree was a bit disappointing (i had the zuppa de pesce) but our waiter was so pleasant that he earned back the 5th star i would've otherwise taken away."", u""so, to wrap up, the restaurant is very expensive and i could never afford to eat there on my own (at least not yet) but i was very happy to go for my dad's birthday. \xa0i guess the wide range of ratings past reviewers have given esca is a reflection of the daily changing menu, but i would definitely recommend taking your chances."
"Awesome pizza, and they're a 'certified green' restaurant, meaning that they've made all sorts of environmentally conscious decisions about how to run their business. Pretty sweet! I feel good giving them my money."
"Cert\xe9 is a convenient and quick lunch spot in Midtown, but it goes beyond the average with fresh flavors and excellent quality for the price. Try the veggie pizza options or the Buffalo Chicken Stromboli. Their soups are also tasty options, just right for a NY winter."
"Visiting from DC and stopped in for a quick dinner. \xa0The pizza was delicious and savory, the staff was cheerful and very friendly. Also, the free brownie at check-in was the bomb. \xa0Only downside is there's not a ton of seating."
This place is awesome! \xa0The gluten free socca is so good and the people that work here are so nice.
"I love it here.', 'I once had a problem with my order, and they gave me and my wife free dinner the next time we ordered. Hard to come by such an honorable restaurant these days."
"Prinze tested. Prinze approved. When my dude Ribby told me the best pizza was in the city I was like PSSSHHHHHHTTTT. In midtown east? That place with all the white people in light blue button downs? Thoze dudes just be eatin SOUP. What do they know about pizza? Lowe's and behold. Shit was doooopppppe. "", 'They have a truffle slice. And anybody who knows Prinze knows truffle is my JAAMM. Get the truffle slice. They have it."
