Community input has been appreciated and considered, so the Board of Education will not be taking public comment on the committee recommendations during the September 6 meeting.

The Board is scheduled to take final action on the following committee recommendations:

1. Name the commons area at MHS West Campus “Frank Prentup Commons”, with an exhibit about Frank Prentup and local Native American history, religion and culture
2. Work with the Manhattan-Ogden Public Schools Foundation to set up a student scholarship and/or a teacher grant
3. Inclusion of local Native American history, religion, culture and contemporary issues in curricular and professional learning considerations of the district
4. Develop a committee to assist and advise efforts of diversity awareness, educational equity, and reduction of racial, ethnic and economic prejudice 
5. MHS Student Council consideration and possible recommendation of a mascot for the high school students to rally around which is distinct from the Indian name and the image – not a person, a mascot distinct from the Indian name and image.",,status,,2017-09-02 13:25:02,0,0,2

The Supreme court pushed the fight back to society. A poll taken by the Washington Post found that 90% of 504 Native Americans surveyed nationwide DID NOT think the Redskins name was offensive, and that likely had more sway on the opinions of undecided people than the Supreme Court.
Now here in Manhattan, KS., comes the ""issue"" of people who want to ""replace"" the mascot of Manhattan High School from an image that was made to honor a Native American to a ""non human"" mascot.
Does the poll taken Nationwide not court? Also ""they"" the committee, came up with a dollar amount to ""change"" the mascot, I am not sure if the symbol in the floor of MHS was included in the cost, and uniforms. A whopping estimate of $275,000!!!!

527750833927938_1252060154830332,"Hello Senior Parents:

Graduation is quickly approaching for your MHS senior.  The Manhattan High School Project Graduation 2017 party planning has begun.  Please pass these details along to your senior.  We will announce the event to students at graduation practice but in the excitement of it all, they might not remember. 

The Project Graduation event is for graduating MHS seniors only.  It is held on graduation evening, Sunday May 21st from 9:00pm-1:00am.  The purpose of this event is to provide our seniors with a fun, safe, drug and alcohol free, night of activities.  The event will be held at the KSU Recreation Complex at Kimball and Denison.  

Students need to arrive by 10:30pm.  Once they leave, they will not be able to return.  Project Graduation is free and activities include:  racquetball, basketball, an inflatable obstacle course, KSU's climbing rock wall, food, prizes and more!!!  All seniors attending who are still present at midnight will receive a free t-shirt with all seniors’ names on the back and at the end of the night we will raffle off a $500 cash prize. 

An extra fee is required by the recreation complex in order for them to allow our students to climb their rock wall.  In addition, if a student is under the age of 18, they will need a parent signature on the Rock Wall Waiver Form.  Please sign it for them and have them bring it with them on the evening of the event.  Please consider making a small donation to our event in order to cover the cost of this activity and prizes.  Checks should be made to “MHS Project Graduation” and can be sent to the high school at 2100 Poyntz Avenue or may be dropped off at the front office.  Please be sure to put my name on the envelope.

I am currently collecting food donations and looking for adult chaperones.  Please use this link to provide food or chaperone: 
 http://www7.mysignup.com/cgi-bin/view.cgi?datafile=mhs_project_graduation_2017 
If the link does not work just go to www.mysignup and search for MHS Project Graduation 2017 or enter my email: kariq@usd383.org .  

All food donations can be dropped off at the KSU Recreation Complex on Sunday the 21st between 8:00 and 9:00pm.  If this time does not work for you, please contact me at 785-587-2100 extension 8098 or via email and we will figure out a way to get your donation there.

Congratulations to you all and thank you for your support with this event.  We typically have anywhere from 50-80% of our seniors in attendance at Project Graduation.

Early this morning, a gas odor was discovered by MHS staff in the West end of on E hall. It was determined that the culinary kitchen had one of two gas stoves with all of the pilot lights out. Exterior doors were opened between rooms E 103 and E 118 to dissipate the odor, and the gas was shut off to the stove in question.

Manhattan Fire Department was contacted to assist in a non-emergent situation to measure air quality in the West end of E hall. Faculty and staff were diverted from this area while MFD tested the hallways and classrooms. At approximately 7:20 AM, the all clear was given by MFD. No air quality issues were detected by MFD.

Beginning today and running through March 5, 2017, RCPD along with the Kansas Highway Patrol and the MHS SADD (Students Against Destructive Decisions) group will be sponsoring and participating in the SAFE (Seatbelts Are For Everyone) campaign and initiative. This initiative focuses on reducing deaths and injuries on Kansas roads and highways.

During this two-week period, law enforcement will be extra vigilant when patrolling around schools. There should be no surprises when it comes to this enforcement effort. Officers will issue citations to any individual who is speeding, texting, or failing to buckle up.

In 2015, according to KDOT statistics, 13 high school teens were tragically killed in motor vehicle accidents. Of those, nearly 40% were not properly restrained.

Even one teen death is unacceptable. Please slow down, put the phone away or turn it off, always buckle up, and be SAFE.

-MHS will be on our 7 period schedule for this Thursday and Friday. 

-Review your 2nd semester schedule and have it on hand, if needed, before coming to school tomorrow.  The first day back from winter break is always a little hectic.  Our ability to print out individual schedules will be very limited. 

-If there is a need to alter your schedule sign up in the counseling office to meet with your grade-level counselor.  Plan on attending the classes that are on your current schedule until you meet with your counselor and your schedule is changed.  If you do not have a class in a particular period, go to the counseling office during that time.  

-By the end of this week, 1st semester grades will be transcribed, and we will be ready to send transcripts out per requests. 

Wishing everyone a great start to the Spring semester,

You now have a Web site available in which to order MHS merchandise for a limited time. Proceeds go toward helping fund the MHS Business Professionals of America (BPA) club. The following link will direct you to the website:  http://coachsassistant.gtmsportswear.com/tribepride

Ordering deadline is midnight on Tuesday, November 15. Many of these items are sold also at our Tribe Pride Store during various school events.

Once you add your item(s) to your cart, you will need to log in or set up an account (if you’ve never ordered from this site). When ordering, in the blank, “Name of Person this order is for,” please write down your student’s name and district building. This will help us in delivery. The items should be delivered to MHS about three weeks after the ordering deadline, just in time for the holidays. Mrs. McCarthy’s Applied Business Development class will then sort and deliver the items to the student at school. But if the item is a gift for an MHS student, please make note of that in the “Name of Person this order is for” blank, and we will contact the parent instead of the student and arrange for you to pick it up. Please leave a reliable phone number.

All orders are final. Please be aware of the upcoming meeting on November 30 regarding the possible alterations to the Manhattan High mascot. BPA appreciates your patronage.

I wanted to inform you that school officials at Manhattan High School conducted a joint operation with officers from the Riley County Police Department and other regional law enforcement entities, including multiple canine units, to perform a random search for illicit drugs. This was a planned and coordinated effort between the school and law enforcement and was not prompted by any specific information regarding drugs or drug activity at the school. 

The building was placed into ""lockout"" mode during the drill, which means that all exterior doors were locked to prevent anyone from entering the building during the search. School officials monitored the front entry ways during the drill to direct any incoming traffic. Students were not permitted to leave their classrooms, but regular instruction did continue for the duration of the drill. The drill was announced at 8:58 AM and concluded at 9:26 AM. 

Positive indicants did arise and school administrators are following up in concert with law enforcement. If you have any questions regarding this drill, please feel free to call me at 587-2100.

Tomorrow evening at Junction City High School our student body and community will have a very unique opportunity to experience a tremendous high school athletic/activity event when Junction City High School hosts Manhattan High School.
Rivalry games provide tremendous environments with lots of energy. They are by their very nature more exciting than a typical game. Of course we want our team to do well and to represent our school and community with pride. The same expectation exists for our spectators.

A fairly recent phenomenon nationwide, and it has occurred for the past two or three years in our student body, has been to toss powdery substances at the start of the game. This act is very unhealthy and can cause extreme distress with breathing, and severe reactions to persons susceptible to asthma attacks. Students are prohibited from bringing powder to the game, and prohibited from engaging in this type of act. Any and all students engaging in this behavior will be removed from the game immediately, and have their privilege of attendance at future events in jeopardy. Here is a link that discusses the health risks associated with this behavior.

http://chicago.cbslocal.com/2012/09/25/doctors-sports-fans-white-outs-can-be-a-big-health-risk/ 

Above all else, we want tremendous support for our school and our team at the game, and we expect the highest standards of fan behavior and good sportsmanship. After all, that's what is really important.

I would like to extend an invitation to each of you to attend the high school Parent/Teacher conferences next week on Wednesday September 21 and Thursday September 22. For those of you who are unfamiliar with the process, this is an opportunity to visit briefly with each of your student's teachers. We do ask that you limit your time with each instructor to five (5) minutes. All teachers (East and West campuses) will be available in the commons area at the West Campus from 4:30 PM to 8:00 PM, and teachers will be seated in alphabetic order. Current grade progress reports will be available for parents to pick up upon arrival. Even if you have printed a schedule from home or plan on using the Infinite Campus phone app, we ask that you check in to assist us in tracking Parent-Teacher conference attendance. 

I would encourage all parents to access information through the Infinite Campus Parent Portal. Any office professional can assist you with your personal access code if you haven't done this yet. I would also encourage you to download the IC Parent Portal app for your smartphone. The district ID is JDSCWC. Although parents have much more access to information via the parent portal, we encourage attendance and face-to-face conversations on educational and social progress of students. Research is clear that all students benefit from close home-school relationships. 

We hope to see you either Wednesday or Thursday evening (or both!)

Manhattan High School has been in regular contact with the Riley County Health Department since August 18 when we noticed an unusual increase in the number of students experiencing gastrointestinal issues.

The RCHD notified the Kansas Department of Health and Environment and those two agencies have been investigating this situation. No cause has been determined, and KDHE is working with another laboratory to conduct more extensive tests. However, we may never know what the root cause of this illness is.

KDHE has been requesting attendance records related to the symptoms of this illness (vomiting, nausea, diarrhea) and have compared these numbers to corresponding dates of last school year. We have had four consecutive days with absenteeism is below the baseline established last year, and therefore have determined that this situation is resolved and MHS has returned to a ""normal"" state.

Cleaning protocol sent to MHS by KDHE will continue today, which includes cleaning all hard surfaces with a 15% bleach solution, will continue through the weekend and beginning Monday we will return to ""normal"" cleaning practice.

Good health habits should continue to be practiced such as thoroughly washing hands prior to eating and after using the restroom. Parents should keep ill students at home, most particularly if they have a fever or are experiencing vomiting or diarrhea. More information may be found at the Riley County Health Department website http://www.rileycountyks.gov/CivicAlerts.aspx?AID=768

I wish that I had some new and relevant information to share with you regarding the unexplained illness that has been affecting some students at MHS West Campus. Unfortunately, there is not a lot of news to share. Main points to share are:

•Students (and some staff) continue to be sent home with symptoms of nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea. The total number of affected individuals is over 150.
•RCHD is desperately in need of stool samples to send to KDHE. Without samples, KDHE cannot identify what is causing this illness. Please, if your student has been experiencing any symptoms, contact RCHD at 785-776-4779 and provide a sample.
•Officials from RCHD, KDHE, and KDA have consulted with the school on measures to be taken, and the school has been initiating these. This includes cleaning kitchen surfaces, cafeteria tables and chairs, water fountains, restrooms, and commonly touched surfaces such as hand rails and door handles with a bleach solution.
•Best practice is to wash hands thoroughly and frequently with soap and water, especially prior to eating and after using the restroom. Do not share food or drink with others, and keep your hands away from your mouth and nose.

We remain hopeful that continued good hygiene practice will pay dividends.

I wish to give you an update on the unusual health issue we have been experiencing for the past week and a half at Manhattan High School West Campus. We have been dealing with an unusually large number of students, and a few staff members, experiencing gastrointestinal issues such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Today we sent 21 students home with symptoms.

A representative from the Kansas Department of Agriculture visited the school this morning and spoke with me, the school nurse, the kitchen manager, and our head custodian. While we do not have a confirmed cause of the outbreak , we are proceeding to execute a plan to clean all kitchen surfaces, cafeteria tables and chairs, water fountains, and restrooms with a bleach solution as directed by the Ag Department official. The belief is that a virus was introduced into the school environment from the outside.

The best practice is for healthy individuals to thoroughly wash their hands often, specifically prior to eating and after using the restroom, and to not share food or drink with others. Individuals who are symptomatic should report this to the school nurse and the Riley County Health Department and stay at home and away from school for a minimum of 24 hours after being symptom free.

We have attached a Norovirus Fact Sheet provided by the Center for Disease Control to the MHS webpage for your information. I wish to reiterate that neither the Riley County Health Department or KDHE has confirmed what we are dealing with.

We appreciate everyone's cooperation in getting this issue under control and eliminated.

I would like to update you on the illness that we have experienced at MHS West Campus for the past week. We have had an extraordinary number of students experiencing nausea and vomiting, but not necessarily a fever. Our school nurse is coordinating with the Riley County Health Department in investigating this unusual situation. Best practice for all continues to be to wash hands regularly, particularly before eating and after using the restroom. Keep your hands away from your mouth, nose, and eyes and do not share food or drink.

Specifically, from KDHE, the advice if students experience symptoms of nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea at home is to STAY HOME! Once symptoms stop, stay home for another 24 hours. If your student has been sick with any of these symptoms, please contact the Riley County Health Department.

It's been a terrific start to the school year, and thank you all for your contributions to that!

I have been notified by our school nurse, Ms. Robin Smith, that in the past week she has sent more students home from school with vomiting than she ever has in her many years of experience. She has contacted the Riley County Health Department, who in turn contacted KDHE who will be assisting us in exploring this unusual situation.

While I don't want to alarm anyone or over react, this is a perfect time to remind everyone of simple steps that may be taken to protect yourself and others. This includes thoroughly washing your hands and keeping your hands away from your mouth and nose. Additionally, do not share food or drink.

Maintaining a healthy environment is a shared responsibility for all of us.

You now have a Web site available in which to order MHS merchandise for a limited time. Proceeds go toward helping fund the MHS Business Professionals of America (BPA) club. 
http://coachsassistant.gtmsportswear.com/tribepride

Ordering deadline is midnight, Monday, August 29. Most, but not all of these items are sold also at our Tribe Pride Store during various school events.

Once you add your item(s) to your cart, you will need to log in or set up an account (if you’ve never ordered from this site). When ordering, in the blank, “Name of Person this order is for,” please write down your student’s name and district building. This will help us in delivery. The items should be delivered to MHS about two weeks after the ordering deadline. Mrs. McCarthy’s Applied Business Development class will then sort and deliver the items to the student at school. But if the item is a gift for an MHS student, please make note of that in the “Name of Person this order is for” blank, and we will contact the parent instead of the student and arrange for you to pick it up.

Our contractor and engineers have cleared the front drive and south parking lot for traffic tomorrow. Traffic at Manhattan High West Campus flows counter-clockwise around the building from the south lot, to the west drive, to the north drive. Do not Enter signs are posted as necessary.

Student Drop Offs - Parents/Guardians, if you are dropping students off in the morning please avoid the front loop due to bus traffic. We ask all student drop-offs to occur in the east lot (accessible from Sunset) or the south faculty lot (accessible from Westwood) and utilize the turnaround circle at the west end of the lot.

Student Parking:

Juniors and Seniors - you are invited to park in the main east lot, accessible from Sunset, or the south student lot accessible from Oak Street via Westwood.

Sophomores - you are required to park in the northwest lot. To access this parking lot you must enter the south faculty parking lot and proceed along the west side of the building (behind the gyms) to the northwest lot. You must exit along the cemetery wall to Sunset.

The two lots across the street are off limits to student parking. These lots are reserved for MHS faculty and staff, K-State student interns, substitute teachers, and guests to Manhattan High School.

All student vehicles must display an official MHS Student Parking sticker. These may be purchased in the main office. Students are encouraged to carpool as much as possible.

Student Parking Areas: Students will be permitted to park in the main parking lot east of the school (Sunset lot). This should be strictly for seniors and juniors. Students may also park in the lot south of the faculty lot (Oak Street lot). Again, this should be used for seniors and juniors. Sophomores are requested to park in the northwest lot behind the school. Faculty and staff parking will be in the south lot (closest to the building), immediately West of the school, along the northside of the school, and the two lots (lower lot and triangle lot) across Poyntz.

Please exit on Westwood to the right only. Parents may also drop students off in the main East lot. NO STUDENT DROP OFFS IN THE FRONT LOOP PLEASE!!! The front loop is for bus traffic and visitor parking only.
 
*** Possibility of alternate traffic plan for Tuesday!!!*** There has been significant concrete work done around the school, and currently the front loop and the entrance to the south faculty lot are not able to support vehicles. Tests will be done on the concrete on Monday to determine if traffic is able to flow through these areas. If not, an alternate traffic plan will be communicated on Monday via messaging. Please be alert for information on Monday!
 
We are looking forward to a fantastic year!

As we come to the close of the 2015-16 school year, we want to communicate a couple of end of the year expectations.

First, we ask that no backpacks or bags be brought to school on the final day, Wednesday  May 25, and that only a writing utensil come to school and perhaps a spiral notebook or a legal pad of paper. Any backpacks that are brought to school will be confiscated by security or administration.

Second, there will not be shuttles between the campuses on the last half day of school. 9th grade students will be at the East Campus for the entire morning and 10th-11th grade students will be at the West Campus. East Campus students with a West Campus class should report to the East Campus cafeteria during class time. West Campus students with an East Campus class should report to the West Campus Little Theater.

Finally, school dismisses at 11:00 AM and the school will be closed during the afternoon to all students unless prior arrangements have been made with a teacher. School staff will begin immediately processing grades and closing down classrooms for the summer. The hallways cannot and will not become a “hang out” for students without official business on Wednesday afternoon or Thursday May 26. All buildings will be officially ""closed"" on Friday May 27 and Monday May 30.

As the end of the school year rapidly approaches, we would like to request for everyone's assistance during the final days of the school year. Recently in the past, some students have elected to participate in behaviors on the Friday after seniors have been dismissed which are counter-productive to a positive learning environment. Unofficially, this day has been known as ""Junior Takeover Day."" 

As we continue our efforts to focus on a positive learning environment for all students, staff, and guests at Manhattan High School we ask for your assistance and commitment to this endeavor. We request that non-essential items not be brought to school (i.e. water balloons, window chalk, glitter, etc) and used to interrupt the learning environment. Every day is a valuable learning opportunity, and it is our job to ensure that it is protected. 

Additionally, as time has progressed many ill-warranted activities have occurred in the community and in some cases, have exceeded the boundaries of harmless pranks. We respectfully ask for your cooperation and encourage all students to finish the year strong and in a positive manner.

Over one million refugees found asylum in Australia, Canada, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, and the United States.  How were they able to escape and where did they go?  Forty Years Fallen:  A Remembrance Exhibit explores the stories of individuals and families who were part of this mass exodus from Vietnam. The exhibit includes visual art, historical artifacts, archival photos, and the refugee performance memoir, The Butcher’s Son, written by Vi Tran and performed by Kansas City-based actors.  Through words and music, the narrative follows the Tran family’s escape from Vietnam, imprisonment by the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia, and eventual resettlement in the meat packing town of Garden City, Kansas.  Originally preformed in Kansas City, Vi Tran notes, “With the passing of the fortieth anniversary of the fall of Sai Gon, I believe it is a timely opportunity to take my story . . . to the very towns that inspired it: the meat packing towns of southwestern and central Kansas . . . to the communities where refugees still struggle with assimilation and where diasporic communities still question, Our stories can be told?

Tomorrow (Friday) is the last day to purchase or pick up tickets to the Prom.  Tickets are only available during lunch.  You will not be able to get tickets on the day of Prom, so if you do not have your ticket by the end of lunch tomorrow, you will not be going. Tickets are $15 for Juniors and $20 for outside of school or Sophomore guests. Seniors can pick up a ticket for free.

Inside the ticket envelope is a numbered wrist band.  Your name is registered with the number on that wrist band.  You must wear it and it will be checked at the door.  You will not be allowed into the mall without the correctly numbered wrist band. 

Prom begins at 9:30 and lasts until mid-night.  There is a Promenade that goes from 9 to 10pm in the mall courtyard located at the end of Poyntz Ave.  Parents are invited to attend the Promenade to watch students and couples be announced. We will have bleachers set up, but seating goes quickly. Students do not have to participate in the Promenade, but you must enter the mall no later than 10:30 or you will not be allowed in.

If it is raining (or looks like it will rain) on Saturday, Promenade will be canceled and students should enter the mall from the food court (former Carlos O'Kelly) side.  We will send out a messenger, put on social media, and on local radio if Promenade is canceled.  So, please watch for this alert Saturday afternoon/early evening.  Either way, only adults signed up to help work the Prom will be allowed into the mall.  Also rain or shine, there will be a coat check in the food court area for students to check extra clothing items during the dance if they wish.

See everyone there for ""Aladdin's Arabian Nights"" Prom

At approximately 10:10AM, all students were given permission to pass to their fourth period class after sheltering in place while the building was checked due to a suspicious gas odor in the west E hall.

The entire building was monitored by both the Manhattan Fire Department and Kansas Gas       Service, and the affected area was ventilated. At no time did any of the detection equipment utilized by either MFD or KGS indicate any abnormal readings.

Several students and adults were checked by school health officials in addition to Emergency Medical Service personnel for symptoms, and all were medically cleared. Students and staff were instructed via PA system to report to the nurse's office for examination if at any time they were not feeling well.

As of this time, the building is under normal occupancy and operation.

I would like to commend all entities that responded this morning that constituted five agencies: MFD, RCPD (School Resource Officers), EMS, KGS, and school officials.

Kansas Gas Service and the Manhattan Fire Department was contacted by MHS this morning after reports of a suspicious gas odor present in west E hall, main floor. The west end of E hall classrooms were evacuated to different locations as responders checked for detectable readings.

This is an ongoing situation, but no readings have been detected by either the Fire Department or Kansas Gas Service. However investigation is still ongoing.

Five students and three faculty members were examined for health concerns, and all have checked out clear but do have mild complaints of nausea and/or head aches.

Currently the building is in a ""shelter in place"" mode, which means that students are not passing to their next classes. Ventilation units have been shut off while Kansas Gas attempts to isolate any issue that may be occurring. Currently the hallway is being ventilated and we anticipate an all clear at approximately 10AM.

We will announce the event to students at graduation practice but in the excitement of it all, they might not remember. 

The Project Graduation event is for graduating MHS seniors only.  It is held on graduation evening, Sunday May 22nd  from 9:00pm-1:00am.  The purpose of this event is to provide our seniors with a fun, safe, drug and alcohol free, night of activities.  The event will be held at the KSU Recreation Complex at Kimball and Denison.  Students need to arrive by 10:30pm.  Once they leave, they will not be able to return.  Project Graduation is free and activities include:  racquetball, basketball, an inflatable obstacle course, KSU's climbing rock wall, food, prizes and more!!!  All seniors attending who are still present at midnight will receive a free t-shirt and at the end of the night we will raffle off a $500 cash prize. 

An extra fee is required by the recreation complex in order for them to allow our students to climb their rock wall.  In addition, if a student is under the age of 18, they will need a parent signature on the Rock Wall Waiver Form.  Please sign it for them and have them bring it with them on the evening of the event.  Please consider making a small donation to our event in order to cover the cost of this activity and prizes.  Checks should be made to “MHS Project Graduation” and can be sent to the high school at 2100 Poyntz Avenue or may be dropped off at the front office.  Please be sure to put my name on the envelope.

I am currently collecting food donations and looking for adult chaperones.  Please use this link to provide food or chaperone:

If the link does not work just go to www.mysignup and search for MHS Project Graduation 2016.  

All food donations can be dropped off at the KSU Recreation Complex on Sunday the 22nd between 8:00 and 9:00pm.  If this time does not work for you, please contact me at 785-587-2100 extension 8098 or via email at kariq@usd383.org  and we will figure out a way to get your donation there.

Thank you for your support with this event.  We typically have anywhere from 50-80% of our seniors in attendance at Project Graduation.

Online registration is here (or will be here soon!). USD 383 will unveil our online registration to USD 383 parents/guardians around June 1. Paper enrollment packets will NOT be mailed out this summer. All registration will be done online through the parent portal. 

If you do not have a parent portal account, you must contact your child's school to receive your individual activation code. Each parent has a unique activation code. Parents/guardians must have a parent portal account set up in order to complete registration this summer.

If you already have a parent portal account there isn't anything else you need to do at this time.

Around June 1, the registration button on the portal will be active. We will be sending out lots of information and reminders about online registration throughout the summer. To save you time filling out registration information this summer, we highly recommend that you complete online registration prior to attending central enrollment. 

Central Enrollment will be held on Friday, July 29 from 7am - 7pm at Manhattan High School West Campus, 2100 Poyntz Ave. Parents/guardians will still need to attend Central Enrollment to finish the enrollment process - pay fees, set up meal accounts, get transportation information, etc. We are looking at adding online payments to our registration process the following year.",,status,,2016-02-19 09:42:02,5,0,3

I would just like to remind everyone that Parent-Teacher conferences will be conducted at MHS West Campus in the commons area on Wednesday February 10 and Thursday February 11 from 4:30PM to 8:00PM.

We do encourage everyone to utilize access to grades and attendance through the Infinite Campus Parent Portal, and also through the Infinite Campus app for smartphones. The district ID for the app is JDSCWC.

We want to be as accurate as possible in tracking attendance, so we ask that everyone enter the front of the building and stop at the top of the stairs where we will have office professionals handing out grade progress reports by last name. Our records indicate that 38.9% of parents attended last fall. To me, that's not good enough. We wish to partner with you in the education of your child and hope that you are able to make the time to visit with our teachers about the progress of your student.

I wanted to inform you that school officials at Manhattan High School conducted a joint operation with officers from the Riley County Police Department and other regional law enforcement entities, including multiple canine units, to perform a random search for illicit drugs. This was a planned and coordinated effort between the school and law enforcement and was not prompted by any specific information regarding drugs or drug activity at the school.
 
The building was placed into ""lockout"" mode during the drill, which means that all exterior doors were locked to prevent anyone from entering the building during the search. School officials monitored the front entry ways during the drill to direct any incoming traffic. Students were not permitted to leave their classrooms, but regular instruction did continue for the duration of the drill. The drill was announced at 9:35 AM and concluded at 10:16 AM.
 
Several positive indicants did arise and school administrators are following up in concert with law enforcement. If you have any questions regarding this drill, please feel free to call me at 587-2100.

You can email photos and information to mhsbluem@gmail.com or deliver a hard copy or an electronic copy to the journalism room, C107. 

For electronic submission of photos, please submit a high resolution (300 ppi minimum) at least 2x3 inches in physical size. The yearbook is printed in full color so black and white photos are not necessary unless it's what you prefer. Portraits will be vertical, so any horizontal or landscape photos will be cropped to fit the vertical portrait orientation. To showcase your child's face as much as possible, we encourage limiting props and using head-and-shoulders shots instead of full-body photos. 

PDA ads can feature individuals, groups, teams, clubs, families, etc. and can be seniors or underclassmen. The ads are available as 1/8 page ($50), 1/4 page ($85), 1/2 page ($150) and full page ($275) and can include multiple photos (the more photos you send the smaller each will be in the ad) and verbal message. Payment and contents need to be received by Dec. 14 to include the ad in the book. 

If you're looking for an affordable senior photo option, the photography students in the MHS chapter of Quill & Scroll are available to take pictures. A 30-minute session with a photographer costs $48 and a 60-minute session is $63. Email mhsmentorbusiness@gmail.com for information.",,status,,2015-11-24 14:24:38,1,0,0

On Wednesday November 11, our community will celebrate Veteran's Day with an annual parade down Poyntz Avenue. Many USD383 schools participate, including the MHS Big Blue Marching Band, and Poyntz Avenue is closed for the parade. The USD 383 Transportation Department will have 35 buses in action that day and due to that demand, and the closing of Poyntz Avenue, there will be no shuttles between East and West Campus for periods 2-4. The first period shuttle from West to East will operate, and all shuttles will operate beginning at 11:27AM.

East campus students who normally ride a shuttle to West for periods 2, 3 or 4 should report to the East Campus cafeteria. West Campus students who normally ride a shuttle to East for periods 2, 3 or 4 should report to the West Campus Little Theater.

I need to inform you that we had an unauthorized entry into Manhattan High School West Campus this morning. Administration was notified at approximately 11:45AM this morning that a white male, late 20's to early 30's, entered a door open for student entry along with students as students arrived to school. This individual made entry and engaged a student in conversation in a locker room before classes began, and then exited the building. No threats of any kind were made in the verbal interaction, but this event is disturbing and unsettling. As we gathered video evidence and narrative statements, RCPD sent us an officer to take our report.
 
We ask all students, staff members, and parents to please keep us informed of incidents that ""don't feel right"" in a timely fashion. All of us place a premium on school safety and while nothing malicious occurred this morning, we all are extremely fortunate. This could have been very, very bad.
 
Manhattan High School administrators and security personnel stage ourselves in the morning in strategic locations during this vulnerable time of student arrival. Yet alone we cannot cover every part of the building. It is incumbent upon all of us, students, staff members, and parents to work together in providing the safest and most secure environment that we are able to.
 
Thank you for your commitment to our students and to our school.

The deadline to apply for K-State, KU, and many other universities is November 1st.  This is less than 2 weeks away.  Please check and know your deadlines and admissions requirements for the schools you are applying to.  

If your school uses the Common Application, you MUST come let Mr. Duntz or Mrs. Ball know.  

If you need a letter of recommendation for your application, you must be asking teachers for those NOW so they have time to complete them.  

If you need your transcript sent, make sure you get those requests in on Naviance or to Mrs. Spiegel in the main office in time for your university to receive it before the deadline. (K-State and KU have requested we not send mid-year transcripts).

It is a good idea to come see Mr. Duntz or Mrs. Ball before your application deadlines just to make sure you have completed your needed application materials successfully.

Sometime late Sunday evening, October 4, 2015, a case of vandalism occurred at the West Campus in which two large windows in the front of the school were shattered. We became aware of this early Monday morning and immediately called RCPD to report it, as well as secure the building.

Law enforcement is working diligently on the case, but recently a rash of rumors have begun to spread among the student body. Once these rumors begin, it becomes increasingly difficult for investigators to do their job.

We have asked students that have legitimate information regarding the vandalism to report this to administrators, or other adults at school, or through Crime Stoppers. Information may be submitted to Crime Stoppers at (785) 539-7777 or toll free at 1-800-222-TIPS (8477). Individuals may also report through text message by sending a text ""TIP 353"" plus the message to CRIMES (274637). Reporting is completely anonymous and individuals may be eligible for a reward.

Please assist us in suppressing rumors that interfere with law enforcement investigations and encourage reporting by means above if anyone you know has relevant information.

I wish to thank all of you that took time out of your schedules to visit with us last week. Investing the time to meet face to face with school representatives truly does make a difference in student achievement. While it's a way off, please mark your calendars for February 10 and 11 of 2016 for spring conferences!

We've been celebrating Homecoming this week with dress up days and several events. We will conduct an all-inclusive school-wide pep assembly tomorrow during sixth period with freshmen being bussed to the West Campus during sixth period. Of course we will host the Topeka West Chargers on Friday night and then finish the week with a Homecoming dance on Saturday night from 7PM to 9PM. Please assist us in having students picked up promptly at 9PM.

The end of the first quarter is quickly approaching, with the last day of the quarter occurring on Thursday October 15. There will not be classes on Friday October 16. Quarter grades are really a check point or progress report. The only grade recorded on transcripts is the semester grade, so I do encourage you to maintain contact with teachers throughout the second quarter.

Finally I would just like to recognize all of the non-teaching staff that we have at Manhattan High School. Between the two campuses we employ 4 security guards, 11 office professionals, and a host of custodians, food service workers, para-educators and classroom aides. These unsung heroes are incredibly important in providing the very best educational environment that we can. If you have an opportunity, please give them a pat on the back. They are absolutely critical in our world.

As always please contact us if you have any questions, and thank you for your patience and your support. Roll Tribe!

I would encourage all parents to access information through the Infinite Campus Parent Portal. Any office professional can assist you with your personal access code if you haven't done this yet. I would also encourage you to download the IC Parent Portal app for your smartphone. The district ID is JDSCWC. Although parents have much more access to information via the parent portal, we encourage attendance and face-to-face conversations on educational and social progress of students. Research is clear that all students benefit from close home-school relationships.

We hope to see you either Wednesday or Thursday evening (or both!)

I also wish to thank each of you that communicated directly with me regarding school incidents this week. Please know that all decisions regarding safety are made in conjunction with local law enforcement (our RCPD School Resource Officer) and, when necessary, district level staff.

The deadline to sign up to take the October 24th ACT is this Friday.  If you are a Senior that has not taken the test before OR you want to improve your score, this date and the December test are really the only dates that will be beneficial for you.  Every student, unless they are just going to work next year, needs to take the ACT during their Junior or Senior year.  All post-secondary education opportunities want you to have an ACT score.  So, please sign up to take the October or December ACT!
 
You register for the test online at www.actstudent.org.

527750833927938_883960168307001,"Dear Parents and Guardians,

I wanted to take a moment just to keep you informed about a few things that you may see or read in the news, and to let you know what your student(s) may or may not be sharing with you at home!

Big news this week out of Topeka ... the State Board of Education approved cut scores on the new state assessment (given last spring). This is a new test, over much more rigorous standards. Student performance is classified differently, and it's important to acknowledge that A) this is a new day in Kansas public education and the Kansas College and Career Readiness standards are far more rigorous than the previous standards (and this is a good thing!) B) We must prepare every Kansas student for success ... in career or post-secondary and C) Student performance has not declined. We cannot compare these results with previous results. Local results will not be available to districts until October, but when they do become available we will inform you of your child's performance (provided they were assessed.)

On the school district front, there is a committee meeting whose charge is to evaluate scheduling issues K-12. This is a representative committee of all levels of education in USD 383, and will be examining and reporting to the BoE and the teacher bargaining unit in January. To the extent possible, the committee will be finding ways to balance instructional time with collaboration and planning time across all levels; elementary, middle and high school. Information can be found on the district website 
http://www.usd383.org/manhattan-ogden/district-office-/district-information/district-committees .

On the school front, we host our first football game at home this year tonight. I would like to invite everyone to come out and cheer on the Indians, but just as important is that at half-time MHS will be officially entering in to an Adopt-A-School partnership with the 1ID Sustainment Brigade and signing a charter. How fitting that this is occurring on Patriot Day! The student section has declared tonight's attire to be ""Red, White and Blue"", and the 1ID Band will be performing with the Big Blue Marching Band.
We want to wish the very best to all students taking the ACT tomorrow morning, to the Boys Soccer team who will be competing for the championship of the Titan Classic in Wichita, to the volleyball team competing at Olathe South, and to the cross country team competing in Emporia.

Finally, we will be conducting our School Safety Week next week. While we cannot possibly prepare for every possible scenario, we can certainly drill and practice in a manner that provides basic life saving strategies for everyone. Any assistance that you can provide from home to help your student(s) take this seriously is appreciated. Furthermore, as we study past events from around the country, we know that parents need to be patient in crisis situations and let the school along with first responders tend to the situation. It is problematic when parents rush to schools in times of crisis and actually can impede the professionals from doing their job and saving lives. We thank you for your cooperation.

Have a wonderful weekend and Roll Tribe!

Our students have been doing very well  for seven years, being named one of the top 2000 high schools in the US; we want the same for them this year.
Background: 
•	317 students
•	645 exams
o	23 separate regular sessions for which we need readers
o	11 accommodation sessions 
o	31 spots where we need faculty supervisors (most are filled)
o	39 parent volunteers needed


Dear Parents,

On May 4, Manhattan High School will begin giving 645 Advanced Placement exams in 21 different subjects.    Because we have more exams this year than ever before.  Your help is crucial to the success of the program.  Please consider signing up for a time to proctor an AP exam, especially if your child is one of the many students benefiting from this excellent program.  Parents may not sign up to proctor an exam their student is taking but may proctor a different exam.  Most exams will take at least three hours with the A.M. exams beginning at 7:30 and the P.M. exams beginning at 11:30.    

Please use the following website, as soon as possible,  to select a time and date which works best for your schedule:

www.SignUpGenius.com/go/20F0B45A5AE2DA4F85-approctors/27053932


If you know of anyone else interested in proctoring, please ask them to email Mrs. Fink at bevf@usd383.org.  

Thank you so much for your willingness to help.  Please let us know if you have any questions.  

Sincerely,

I would like to extend an invitation to each of you to attend the high school Parent/Teacher conferences this Wednesday February 11 and Thursday February 12. For those of you who are unfamiliar with the process, this is an opportunity to visit briefly with each of your student's teachers. We do ask that you limit your time with each instructor to five (5) minutes. All teachers (East and West campuses) will be available in the commons area at the West Campus from 4:30 PM to 8:00 PM, and teachers will be seated in alphabetic order. Current grade progress reports will be available for parents to pick up upon arrival. Even if you have printed a schedule from home or plan on using the Infinite Campus phone app, we ask that you check in to assist us in tracking Parent-Teacher conference attendance.

Although parents have much more access to information via the parent portal, we encourage attendance and face-to-face conversations on educational and social progress of students. Research is clear that all students benefit from close home-school relationships.

We hope to see you either Wednesday or Thursday evening (or both!)

There are approximately 16,000 Semifinalists in the 60th annual National Merit Scholarship Program from across the country. These academically talented high school seniors have an opportunity to continue in the competition for 7,600 National Merit Scholarships, worth more than $33 million, that will be offered next spring. To be considered for a Merit Scholarship award, Semifinalists must fulfill several requirements to advance to the Finalist level of the competition. About 90% of the Semifinalists are expected to attain Finalist standing, and approximately half of the Finalists will win a National Merit Scholarship, earning the Merit Scholar title.

NMSC, a not-for-profit organization that operates without government assistance, was established in 1955 specifically to conduct the annual National Merit Scholarship Program.
