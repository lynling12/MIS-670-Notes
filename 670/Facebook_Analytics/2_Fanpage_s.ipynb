Please pass these details along to your senior.  We will announce the event to students at graduation practice but in the excitement of it all, they might not remember. \\n\\nThe Project Graduation event is for graduating MHS seniors only.  It is held on graduation evening, Sunday May 21st from 9:00pm-1:00am.  The purpose of this event is to provide our seniors with a fun, safe, drug and alcohol free, night of activities.  The event will be held at the KSU Recreation Complex at Kimball and Denison.  \\n\\nStudents need to arrive by 10:30pm.  Once they leave, they will not be able to return.  Project Graduation is free and activities include:  racquetball, basketball, an inflatable obstacle course, KSU's climbing rock wall, food, prizes and more!!!  All seniors attending who are still present at midnight will receive a free t-shirt with all seniors\\u2019 names on the back and at the end of the night we will raffle off a $500 cash prize. \\n\\nAn extra fee is required by the recreation complex in order for them to allow our students to climb their rock wall.  In addition, if a student is under the age of 18, they will need a parent signature on the Rock Wall Waiver Form.  Please sign it for them and have them bring it with them on the evening of the event.  Please consider making a small donation to our event in order to cover the cost of this activity and prizes.  Checks should be made to \\u201cMHS Project Graduation\\u201d and can be sent to the high school at 2100 Poyntz Avenue or may be dropped off at the front office.  Please be sure to put my name on the envelope.\\n\\nI am currently collecting food donations and looking for adult chaperones.  Please use this link to provide food or chaperone: \\n http://www7.mysignup.com/cgi-bin/view.cgi?datafile=mhs_project_graduation_2017 \\nIf the link does not work just go to www.mysignup and search for MHS Project Graduation 2017 or enter my email: kariq@usd383.org .  \\n\\nAll food donations can be dropped off at the KSU Recreation Complex on Sunday the 21st between 8:00 and 9:00pm.  If this time does not work for you, please contact me at 785-587-2100 extension 8098 or via email and we will figure out a way to get your donation there.\\n\\nCongratulations to you all and thank you for your support with this event.  We typically have anywhere from 50-80% of our seniors in attendance at Project Graduation.\\n\\nThanks,\\n\\nKari Q.
