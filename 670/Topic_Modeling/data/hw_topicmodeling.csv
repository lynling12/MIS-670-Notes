"ETC: These are the overloaded cars of South Korean workers fleeing North Korea Filed under: Government/Legal , South Korea Around 175 South Korean workers have been forced to pack up their belongings and leave a group of jointly operated factories in North Korea after tensions continued to escalate between the two countries. The workers piled tools and finished products high onto the roofs of regular passenger cars as they evacuated as quickly as possible. North Korea says the ongoing talks with its southern neighbor geared toward keeping the factory complex operational were ""deceptive"" given that the US and South Korean armed forces continue to practice joint drills nearby. South Korea , meanwhile, was concerned that workers could be deprived of food or medicine if the situation continued to sour. The evacuation has placed the future of factories operated jointly by the two countries into question and marks the most significant casualty of the continued degradation of relations between the neighbors.

"Beautiful coutyard hotel in a cool part of Beijing	In the hutongs near the Bell and Drum Towers, this hotel was exceptional. Staff were very helpful and friendly, room was warm and beautifully furnished. Although it was near a busy, funky street, once inside the courtyard it was very peaceful. We stayed in Room 11 which was tucked away just off the main courtyard - gorgeous..15 minute walk to a subway stop and the streets around at night have great restaurants and bars and shops..fantastic buzz! conveniently located	Was at Courtyard 7 for 3 nights. Great location with many shops and pubs around. The room a bit small. Breakfast was ok. Free internet at the restaurant all day and night. Long walk to train station. Will stay there again. very nice experience	i stayed at Courtyard 7 for 3 days,and i am so impressed by the beautiful hotel.i am so surprised that it could be so quiet in the noisy center of the city.the staff are so nice and helpful,and they are always smiling.i would recommand it to everyone who want to experience the traditional Chinese courtyard. VERY NICE HOTEL IN CENTER	Our second hotel in Beijing We stayed 3 nights in this lovely hotel. It's a series of renovated courtyards in the old part of Beijing within walking distance of Hohai Lake, Beihai Park and the Forbidden City - it's a lovely stroll through the lakes and parks to Tiananmen Square.We got the room very nice and cozy; the staff was very sweet and spoke excellent English. The rooms are quite small but beautifully furnished with lovely bathrooms. The room was very clean and good smell. We really loved this and location is the best. Beautifull hotel	The hotel room was good enough for couple, the location is good but one thing that we dont like so much that 's staffs, they should try to helpfull and friendy . Oct 22 2009 	Just what I was hoping it would be...	I waited until just before my trip to Beijing to try and find a hotel. I was optimistic I could find something nice, but Courtyard 7 exceeded even my hopes. It was perfect. A converted 300+ year old traditional courtyard home, the place oozes charm. I was upgraded (at no cost) when I arrived, and found myself in possession of my own tiny courtyard, off the main court. The room was beautifully appointed with lovely, boldly-colored fabrics and traditionally-designed furnishings. The mattress was thin, but I slept like a baby. My suite also had a small sauna, which I enjoyed after a day spent hiking a stretch of the Great Wall at Simatai. The hot water took a long time to heat up in the walk-in shower, but once it did, it was scalding. The water pressure was good. The hotel is located off Nanluoguxiang, which is a pleasant, tree-lined street with scores of small designer shops, bars, and restaurants. (There's an excellent Korean restaurant only a few steps away from Courtyard 7.) The hotel is about 2/3 of the way up the street, on the northern end. Plenty of taxis can be found on either end of Nanluoguxiang. It’s a long but manageable stroll to the Forbidden City, and Qianhai Lake is just a short walk away. The area around the hotel is a matrix of hutong alleyways, and is definitely worth a few long, winding strolls to soak in the community’s vibe. The entrance to the hotel itself is tucked away down a narrow hutong lane, about 30 yards off the street. Stepping into a wooden doorway, you enter a series of courtyards of different sizes, with small trees and lanterns. At night, the lanterns provide a lovely glow that reinforces a romanticized stereotype of &quot;old China.&quot; The whole effect was comfortable, calming, and very romantic. The price was perfectly reasonable, and I was very pleased with the upgrade. The staff was pleasant, helpful, and enthusiastic. They arranged train tickets for me, recommended good restaurants in the area, and were generally friendly and responsive. Their English was not perfect, but functional.If return to Beijing, I will hope to stay at Courtyard 7 again. I would unhesitatingly recommend the place to anyone who finds themselves in Beijing. It was wonderful. Sep 1 2009 	Lovely courtyard hotel	We stayed 3 nights in this lovely hotel. It's a series of renovated courtyards in the old part of Beijing within walking distance of Hohai Lake, Beihai Park and the Forbodden City - it's a lovely stroll through the lakes and parks to Tiananmen Square. The staff were very sweet and spoke excellent English. The rooms are small but beautifully furnished with lovely bathrooms. The rooms open directly onto a beautiful courtyard where you can sit and read. The only problem for me was that the bed was rock hard - like sleeping on the floor! I've stayed in other hotels (mostly faceless modern ones) in China and this wasn't the case. Breakfast was fine and served in a pleasant room or outside. They'll cook eggs for you and you can help yourself to cereals, toast and pastries. Everything is very sweet though - even the bread. The hotel is located in a small hutong just off Nan Lou Gu Xiang, a gentrified hutong full of trendy bars and shops. Great for a stroll but prices are high. As an example, a beer in this street will cost between 20 and 30 yuan (£2 to £3) but if you just pop into one of the little Chinese street cafes the same beer is around 4 yuan (less than 50p!). We booked the hotel online which was considerably cheaper than the walk in rate. I love this part of Beijing and would definitely stay here again. Jun 28 2009 	great place - fabulous staff	My family and I recently stayed at Courtyard 7 during a trip to China for a family wedding. There were 3 generations together from my dad who is 84 to my nephew who is 22. We were all made to feel welcome by staff who couldn't do enough for us. The rooms were spotless. The beds were typical of those often found in China - hard. We asked for an extra quilt to put on top of the matress and this took the edge off it. Having stayed in a few hotels in China hard beds seem to be normalThe breakfasts were a good mix of Chinees and European / Continental - buffet style with plenty of everything available. We didn't eat an evening meal in the resturant. There are some very nice local places to eat.The courtyard was a lovely place to sit and read and chill out after bust day seeing the fantastic sits of Beijing. Some of the rooms even had their own small courtyard which could be shut off.The hotel is in a lovely hutong area which is full of interesting shops, bars and resturants. Its within walking distance to the Drum and Bell Towers and a short taxi ride to the Forbidden City. The hotel reception gave us a really useful card with the names of the tourist sites in both English and characters - a great help in getting around. Jun 4 2009 	Very nice!	I only had lunch there but I really liked the place, I saw some of the rooms, the area is nice. I will stay there next time! Jun 3 2009 	Great place for location and history	This hotel is a real gem for students those who appreciate hutong life. The restoration is incredible and immaculate. There are several rooms with private courtyards and we had one of these. The staff speaks some English and is very attentive. Breakfast includes fresh fruit and seems to be plentiful. I had some Beijing friends come to the hotel before going out to the bars on the lane. They were so impressed with the courtyard we ended staying up late talking in the hotel courtyard.There are several restaurants in the area that deliver to the hotel so it is possible to have pizza or roast fish served in your private courtyard.If you want to stay in the hutong this is a place to consider. Most cab drivers will not know where it is even after reading the address. just ask to go to Nan Luo Gu Xiang Hutong and Gulou East street and walk down the lane. The hotel is near the Korean restaurant. May 25 2009 	A friendly welcome to Beijing	It was my first trip to China and I stayed here the first 3 days - once more I was lucky in the choice of my hotel! The whole place is soothing and spic and span. The courtyards are a haven of peace and quiet in the middle of the busy hutongs alleys around. The old trees and the red lanterns create a wonderful atmosphere at night. The bathrooms were well equiped with walk-in showers and amenities. The rooms were perhaps a little too small for the huge beds and thus quite cramped. True to the Chinese fashion beds are with futon and quite hard. No problem for me but perhaps for those not used to such hard bedding.The front desk people were friendly and fluent in English. They for example patiently assisted me in getting some documents printed out and sent on via fax. Breakfast was OK but not really something to excite me.The area around the Courtyard 7 Hotel is quite touristy but still it has kept it's own charm especially at night. Visit some of the bars/restaurants with tables on the roof. Small and simple Chinese restaurants/food shops serve far better food than the &quot;Western Style&quot; restaurants; even though the interior might seem a little &quot;precarious&quot;. Apr 3 2009 	Simply perfect	This small fairly new hotel is flawless. What impressed me most was the attention to detail and thought put into it: from bedroom draperies and staff uniforms to wooden decorations around the bathroom door, heated floor, and a beautifully done shower room. Breakfast was nothing to complain about with a choice of Western options AND samples of traditional Chinese dishes. The hotel staff is lovely and helpful. Once we were late for breakfast (which ends at 9.30am) and were still served; when we were leaving for the airport at 4am, we were surprised with a pre-packed breakfast prepared for us.Among other small bonuses are: free internet, cheap laundry service, free bicycle hire, tea pot in the room, daily refreshed toiletries. Hutongs around the hotel are worth exploring, and with a school across the street we could watch young pioneers doing their morning PE from the breakfast room area. For nightlife, there are some great clubs around the corner: Mao Live House and Yu Gong Yi Shan.The only drawback – distance form the subway: 15-min walk to the nearest station.The hotel is absolutely beautiful and comfortable. I would definitely recommend it for a holiday stay. Oct 30 2009 	?????????????????????? Sep 13 2009 	""Le Rêve dans le Pavillon Rouge"""
"Nov 4 2009 	Not bad in fact quite good	I took a group of university students to Beijing to attend a week long conference. Each morning, bright and early, our free breakfast was vast, fresh, and delicious.As we needed to often secure taxis, the concierge was more than helpful, getting up Google maps of our destination, and talking in Chinese to our taxi drivers to make sure they understood where we were going.The hotel is elegant; however, the staff was impeccable. Always smiling,always accommodating.We were impressed. I suspect you will be too. Aug 23 2009 	Excellent hotel	Stayed there three nights in July. Got upgraded to Club Level (due to Marriott Rewards status), and had a very nice top floor room. Very friendly and helpful staff.Located between city center and airport. 5 minutes walk to Holiday Inn-area with many restaurants. Also 5 minutes walk to shopping center (can be a bit hard to find, though).Breakfast buffet was ok, but not more than that.Downstairs, the bar advertized with Guinness pints for CNY55, but served 25cl (~half pint), yet still charged CNY55, even though I explained how much a pint actually is. Aug 20 2009 	Great service for first time visitors	My husband, daughter, and I recently stayed in the Beijing Marriot Courtyard Hotel along with other family members and friends while visiting China. We found the hotel and its staff to be tremendously helpful and courteous at all times. the staff at the front desk handled all of our reservations very well, our rooms were very clean and comfortable, the facilities were comfortable and well located. The highlight of the hotel, however, is its quality of service particularly by the concierge. Davis was so very helpful with every question, problem, need, request, etc. at any time. He booked plane tickets, show tickets, hailed taxis, provided information and maps and generally provided a superior quality of service. to people new to china and to beijing in particular, his advice and quality of information was very helpful and much appreciated. Aug 6 2009 	Perfect Beginning and Ending for a China Trip	We stayed at the Courtyard by Marriott Beijing Northeast twice -- once in July when we arrived in China and again in August before our departure from the country. We chose the hotel because of its convenience to the airport, about 20 minutes by cab. The new high-rise building features immaculate, spacious rooms with extremely comfortable beds ... no hard rocks here, which seem to be typical throughout China. The ultramodern bathroom features a huge walk-in shower with many water heads to massage the body. The flat-screen television has myriad English channels, including HBO. The first night we stayed on the 18th floor; the second night on the 16th. Both times we overlooked the rear of the building, which was absolutely quiet.It was impossible to include breakfast when we booked the hotel on the Internet. We thought that $20 (U.S.) per person was rather expensive for a buffet breakfast, so we opted to grab something to eat at the airport. It is possible, however, to buy pastries 50 percent off from the MoMo Cafe in the lobby after 5 p.m. and nibble on them in the morning while drinking tea or coffee in the room. The high-priced second-floor restaurant (Chinese and Western) had a special during our stay -- 50 percent off all food selections. We ate there twice and found the food to be tasty and good value, because of the special. We checked out the large, modern fitness room and thought it offered the most equipment we've seen in our travels worldwide. The pristine lap pool and adjacent hot tub also beckoned. No one was using any of these amenities when we were in the area.English-speaking staff stood ready to assist us with information, directions, etc. They offered big smiles and exceptional service. We could not have asked for more.I would like to comment about some descriptions that appeared in early reviews about this hotel. They do not seem to describe the place accurately, so I wonder if a couple got posted in the wrong place. For example, the hotel is not next to a mall and there is no food place across the street. There is no nearby Starbucks to the right of the entrance. Also, a comment about bathrooms being left out of renovations made no sense, because this is a new hotel with fabulously modern bathrooms.If you want a Starbucks, there is one about a 10- to 15-minute walk away. Exit the main entrance and walk to the left to the first traffic light. Cross the street and pass under the light rail system. When you come to the Holiday Inn on the right, enter the hotel and you will find a mall that holds many shops, including a Starbucks.As other reviewers have mentioned, be prepared for airport cab drivers to have a hard time finding the hotel, even with maps and concise directions in Chinese. Our driver for our second stay realized he was going around in circles and turned off the meter. It should cost about Y60 (Y50 for the taxi and Y10 for the road toll) to go between the airport and the hotel. Jun 16 2009 	My favorite stay in Asia...DON'T skip breakfast	What an awesome hotel! My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed our 7-night stay at this hotel. All the staff speak English very well (which is good because I don't know a word of Chinese). They set us up with a Marriott rewards program for free without us even asking. The room was spectacular. It was very new, modern, and sleek. The views were nice too.Location is a tricky thing in Beijing. The city isn't like other very large cities. It is very spread out which makes 1 particular location not as important to stay in for a Leisurely traveler like us. The cabs in Beijing are so ridiculously cheap, I didn't mind spending the $5 trip to almost any location in Beijing I needed. Plus, the hotel staff will inform the driver where you want to go and its no issues from there. If the subway is what you want to use, then just hop on a bus outside the hotel, take it 1 to 2 stops and youre right at the subway station. Plus, it was great to be so much closer to the airport than most other hotels. The taxi ride price didn't hurt as much as it could have to the airport.Breakfast is tricky, so make sure you do it right. Make sure to book your hotel stay with BREAKFAST INCLUDED. When I booked the hotel online myself, it was only $3 extra per night (for both me and my wife total!). The breakfast is amazing! The staff at the restaurant knew our hotel room number without us telling them by the 3rd day. They are sooo friendly and our at your service at every possible second. (I've never seen a hotel breakfast staff so attentive). The food at the breakfast is of course the best part....fruit, pancakes, sausage, potato wedges, cereal, salad, egg station, pastries, donuts, dumplings, etc etc etc. Just amazing. Coffee and tea are served to you immediately upon sitting as well.Next, the gym. Very nice gym and very modern. Free for use and I appreciated it very much since I was there for 7 nights. Individualized TVs are at all the cardio equipment and there's plenty of weight machines for whatever you need. There's enough free-weights for a good workout as well. Also included is a nice lap pool and spa tub. Didn't use those two, but they looked very nice...so bring your bathing suit.The only minor issue I had with this hotel was the internet. The price was out of this world. Something to the effect of $15 for 20 minutes....ouch.There's just too many good things to say about this hotel to list here. Normally I'm not so positive about hotels (you can see that by my other reviews), but I just loved this hotel! I'm a big fan and fully recommend. While it appeared that most guests to this hotel were business travelers, I recommend it to leisurely ones too. Plus the concierge was great and very very helpful with suggestions and making reservations. Jan 25 2009	Great Airport Convenience	We stayed at the Beijing Courtyard Marriott North East because of a layover in Beijing [flights from the interior of china may not get one to Beijing in time to collect bags and check in again for an international flight – a 3 hour process]. We chose this hotel because of the Marriott brand and because of its advertised proximity to the airport. The hotel is excellent if you have just one night to spend in Beijing or if you have business in the neighborhood. The hotel is far from Beijing city sights so it may not be the best choice when traveling as a tourist to see Beijing. This particular Courtyard Marriott lacks a courtyard. Instead the hotel is in a tall high-rise building from which guests can enjoy a sunrise or sunset through the Beijing smog.Our room was finished in ultra modern style with large flat screen TV, ability to upload PC presentations or DVD or MP3 to the TV/sound system. Internet was available [wired] at prices above most business class hotels. The beds were equivalent to good quality western hotels – not at all the hard style typical of China. The bathroom was shiny and new and of course clean. An interesting architectural twist of our room’s bathroom was an interior window that enabled one to see into the bedroom. The Courtyard Marriott has a fine buffet breakfast with plenty of western food. When we ate there, we could see plenty of business days getting started at tables where half the guests were Western and half Chinese. Our business was simply to catch our plane back to the US.The Courtyard Marriott does not have a courtesy bus. So to get to the Courtyard, one takes a taxi from a regular stop outside baggage claim. Tip: Have the Chinese character name and address of the hotel available for the driver. Our driver had no idea where to go and spent 5 minutes asking around. Note: drivers are not too happy to get a short fare to Courtyard Marriott rather than a long fare to Beijing center. We gave our driver a tip in addition to the 60Y fare. Jan 24 2009 	Much better than expected	After reading the previous reviews on this newer hotel, I was a little skeptical on staying here..but I was pleasantly surprised with everything!The hotel is located about 20 minutes from the airport, and 10 minutes to downtown without any traffic. No subway station is close by..the nearest is on the same road but about 2 miles away. Taxi cost about 50rmb from Term 3.Check in was flawless. From the moment we pulled up we were taken care of by the english speaking staff. Took photocopies of our passports and checked us in to a high floor as requested. (I recommend you get a high floor as well due to traffic noise from the busy street.)Now the entire hotel looks and even smells new. It is eloquently designed and is very modern. Our room on the 15th floor had two double beds and the bellman showed us every amenity the hotel had to offer and even gave us a map.Room was large, modern, lcd tv, and everything you would expect out of a newer hotel. Only complaint was that there was no wall seperating the bathroom from the bedroom and the window was only &quot;shut&quot; by two flimsy see-thru curtains...not much privacy.Restaurants and mini bar usage are expensive....just venture outside and you will everything you want at about 1/10 the cost.One word of caution, although not the hotels fault, is the location. It is on a VERY main road, think the service road from the Airport Expressway and right off the 4th Ring Road...however every single cab driver on our trip looked at our little map of the hotel and shrugged. Lots of driving around pointing at the building trying to find out how to get there!Checkout was as flawless as check in. Wonderful english and always a smile. Will stay here again when in Beijing. Jan 3 2009 	Decent but needs improvement	Our stay here was arranged through China Travel Service where they organized a tour for us with a guide over 4 days. I can recommend a private tour guide who's English was great! Message me if you need the details. He's about $35 a day or so but that INCLUDES a driver and pick up from the aiport (but don't quote me on that!)First off - one thing is sure in Asia - the beds are HARD. You'll just have to get over it because there are no soft beds in Asia. Anywhere!I liked that the hotel was modern looking. Flat screen TV, nice room but bathroms were missed in the renovation??? Good location - close to many main attractions. Conveniently located next to a mall incase you forget to pack your husband's underwear like I did! LOL!!!Breakfast was included in our package. Someone needs to teach hygiene to the young gentleman that was working in the omelette stand. First of all, he obviously had a cold. his nose was red and eyes were runny - and he was preparing food! I watched and heard him clear his throat and SPIT in the drain by his feet. disgusting! The rest of the food, well, eat there only if it is included in your room fee like ours was. I liked the noodles but that was about it.If you're feeling adventurous, DO go across the street from the main entrance of the hotel. There is a little door to a market where locals line up to get food. There is also a market there and candy stalls. Very interesting if you're looking for food culture!!WESTERN AMENITIES:Starbucks! Yes, there is strong coffee around the corner. Walk out the main entrance, turn right and you'll see it in about 30 seconds (as well as a McDonalds).MASSAGE:Tired from walking around all day? This SAVED US:Walk out the main entrance about a block and a half. Pass the shady hotel that is on your right hand side and there is a massage spa parlor there. We tried it out and BOY were we surprised!!! It's a gorgeous zen-like spa - they have a menu at the front desk but all we wanted was an hour long foot massage and we managed to get one with awesome service in a private room for $12 USD for ONE HOUR! The room was great too with comfy brown and modern microfibre couches and a TV inside. they serve you tea or coffee. Next thing you know, you're out like a light!!! Jan 1 2009	Nice rooms good location skip breakfast	Good location near the forbidden city and attached to a shopping mall (great when it is cold). Excellent veggie restaurant one block away. Skip the breakfast. $20 a head and better food can be found in the neighborhood for more like $3 a head. Rooms are nice and modern. Nov 8 2008 	OK  could be better	This hotel is modern and very well located to the major tourist attractions within Beijing. The rooms are nicely appointed though not huge. We stayed in a standard room on the 11th floor about $125 per night. You want a high floor in China due to construction and traffic .There is a modern mall right next door to this hotel however the prices and items sold in it would not be of interest to Western tourists. What is of interest is the supermarket located in the basement of the mall which is convenient for snacks, beverages and sundries. There are restaurants in the area for a quick bite but the nicer restaurants are located a short cab ride away and you need to make reservations.The food at the hotel itself , although overpriced, is not bad. There is an ATM which takes international cards around the corner of the block. The hotel is more oriented to businessmen than tourists so plan accordingly if you are a tourist . The breakfast (which is usually included ) is very busy around 8AM at the cafe but clears up at about 9AM. Also, You really need to arrive with your tourist sight seeing package already booked since I did not see an agency in the hotel. The one area which is seriously lacking at this hotel is the service quality at the front desk. I tried to extend my reservation one day and the front desk could not accomodate me even though there was room in the hotel. I had to go online to a Marriot website to book the room myself and then show the front desk. They also had trouble with foreign exchange transactions and are clearly inexperienced handling money. Use the ATM instead though expect about a 3.50 fee charged. Otherwise, the service at the hotel was fine. Oct 22 2008	Enjoyed my stay at the Courtyard	We Visted China for the Olympics and stayed at the Marriott Courtyard Northeast, Beijing. 11 of us visited for 11 nights we really enoyed our stay and the staff at the hotel is unbeivably efficient. I have a memory foam mattress at home and the rooms are so comfortable that I didn't even miss my own bed. The entire decor of the rooms are very nice, the staff at the bellmans desk are very helpful and you don't have to wait five minutes for a cab.Before I went to China I did'nt eat Chinese food because of a heart condition, I explained this to the chef and he prepared my meals specially so I was able to eat chinese food while I was there without getting sick. The MOMO Cafe which is the resturant in the hotel prepare an exquisite buffet every day. The food was not prepared the way I know Chinese food to be prepared in the western world ,much better than I expected.Two things I found was that it was absolutely very expensive and that none of the housekeeping and few of the front of the House staff spoke or understood english . However , best hotel I have stayed in, were treated very nice and we enjoyed our stay. If I went back to China I would stay there again. Nov 18 2009	Neu und gut"
"Romancing the warm pool	I really enjoyed the pool and witnessed an amazing spa with steam and sauna. Loved the variety of restaurants and people were quite friendly. The atmosphere was amazing. Nov 4 2009 	Very nice especially Club Lounge	We stayed here for over a week as family member is living a subway stop away. Club Lounge was convenient and concierge Michelle was terrific. Hotel is 45 minutes or so from city center but subway nearby-take left going out of hotel. At big mall near Carrefours (go left out of hotel, take right on first big street Zhongguancun &amp; go on left side of street) there are modern restaurants which are very good: Bellagio, Middle 8. Also a 7/11. If you go left on Zhongguancun from hotel, there is Three Guizhou Men for dumplings. All three are modern and well known. Better yet try Ghost Street and Huajia Yiyuan as suggested by Michelle. Aug 19 2009 	Amazing hotel	As funny as it might sound, one of my favorite things about this hotel was coming in the front doors and feeling the coolness and smelling the fresh, softly scented air in the hotel's lobby. It just felt so good to be staying there. The room was huge, including a huge bathroom. One of the best parts is that the room was SILENT. We were exhausted on this trip and were so grateful for quality sleep. The hotel's breakfast buffet was abundant and delicious, and was a great way to start our day. The whole hotel is very well appointed with quality, stylish materials. The staff was truly nice and helpful. I have to agree with other comments about taxis not knowing where this place is, though. Even with my Chinese friends speaking to the drivers, there always seemed to be a discussion about where the hotel is. That being said, we always go where we were going. HIGHLY recommended if you don't mind taking a cab to your destination. Aug 17 2009 	Lovely hotel 	we stayed in this hotel in July 2009. it was lovely. we had a lovely suite. it was actually one of the best suite's we have stayed in. Room was very spacious.the only thing it did not have was a spa. but We were told that there is one opening in September 2009. Jun 18 2009 	Excellent Hotel--highly recommended	Hi, my family of three stayed in the hotel, 11-17 June 09. This review covers price, location, facilities and staff of the hotel, plus some travel tips on Beijing. (Please note that US$1 is about 6.8 yuan.)1. HOTEL LOCATION: If you are in a tour group, location is irrelevant, since the tour bus takes you to the designated places. But if you are on your own, or decide to leave the tour group for some freedom, here you go.... This hotel is NEAR Summer Palace (25 yuan by taxi), Peking University, Tsinghua University (15 yuan by taxi) and the Olympic &quot;Bird Nest&quot;, a 20-minute subway ride away; Forbidden Palace and Tiananmen are 40 minutes away by the subway, costing 2 yuan per trip.If you are heading to the Great Wall, and you have 3 people, book a cab through the concierge. It costs at most 650 yuan or less than US$30 per person. Much has been said about the hotel's location. In reality, the existing subway, plus a new line to be completed by end 2009, makes most famous tourist destinations readily accessible from this hotel. The subway is modern, clean and has arrival/departure announcements also in English. However, do plan your subway trip to make sure everything goes smoothly. The nearest station, &quot;Zhongguancun Huangzhuang&quot; station, is a 5-minute walk from the hotel--it's on the left, when you head out of the hotel main door. Remember the subway EXIT/ENTRANCE nearest the hotel is C1. Please write this down; don't say I didn't tell you...Besides the subway, there are taxis aplenty, and they are cheap.TIP: If you have only 1 day in Beijing, visit the Great Wall in the morning, because it gives you an idea of how tough the Chinese are, and how smart they are. In the afternoon, visit Peking University or Tsinghua which are a 10-minute cab ride from the hotel. Some of the top intellectual and political Chinese leaders are alumni of these two universities. Visit Tiananmen and the Forbidden City at night using the subway (2 yuan) to get there, or catch a cab (about 50 yuan, at most.) You can't get into the Forbidden City at night, but the night view from outside is still great. A 10-minute walk away from Tiananmen is Wangfujing, Beijing's main shopping area--quite fascinating.2. PRICE. This hotel is probably one-third cheaper than a comparable downtown hotel. I would say, save your money, and use the savings to live it up! The best way to book room is via the Crowne Plaza website http://www.ichotelsgroup.com/h/d/cp/1/en/hotel/pegzg. Look for Advance Purchase package to secure good deals. 3. FACILITIES: The hotel provides all the amenities you expect from a good hotel. The gym and heated indoor swimming pool are both very satisfactory. Valley Cafe provides a good international and Chinese spread for breakfast. If you are fortunate enough to stay in the Club floor rooms or suites, you will enjoy the benefits of the Club Lounge, which is the perfect place to relax after a morning and afternoon tour. Drinks and other refreshments are on the house. There's free internet access for club rooms and suites, but remember to bring your own notebook. I highly recommend you pay a little extra for a Club Floor room or a suite for their added comfort and amenities. When you take a rain shower in these commodious rooms, you will know that you have a better deal than the emperors in the Forbidden City. (I am not sure if rain shower is provided in all rooms.)If you come from British Commonwealth countries, Hong Kong, Malaysia or Singapore, note that the electricity cycles (220-240) are the same, so you don't need an adapter. Folks from the US, you need an adapter, which you can probably borrow from the hotel. My family didn't have any problems using the internet.4. STAFF: The staff in this hotel are fabulous. They are friendly and helpful. During my stay, I relied heavily on the Concierge to assist me in my sightseeing plans and to fix any problems I encountered. The concierge staff, especially a young man named Manson Wang, went out of his way to assist me. He helped me fix a trip to the Great Wall--undoubtedly my best Beijing tour experience--and also gave me advice on restaurants and places of interest. The Club Lounge staff were consistently friendly, gracious, and professional. In particular, I give very high ratings to Sharon Wang, the Club Lounge manager, and also to her staff &quot;Summer&quot; and &quot;Youkee&quot;. My hotel reservation was made with the assistance of Ms Angel Ma, who made two international calls to me on the same day I made the booking inquiry. Both the Director of Marketing and Sales, Ms Georgette Ng, and the General Manager, Mr George Chiu, saw to it that my stay was comfortable, and that I received good service. Georgette welcomed my family personally on my arrival. I was also especially impressed by the fact that the GM spoke with me personally to make sure everything was OK. Many staff addressed me by my name. The unintrusive attentiveness to service was very good. All these, despite the fact that I am an ordinary customer.I spoke English to all the staff, and, yes, occasionally I could tell that they have problems understanding me, but their helpful attitude and their genuine desire to serve the guests made me very forgiving. A little patience on our part as guests, can help.Travel GuideA. TAXI. There are 75,000 cabs in Beijing, and all legal cabs have the word &quot;Taxi&quot; on top. Taxi drivers do NOT speak English; therefore, make sure the concierge staff writes down the place you are visiting and also give you a card to identify the hotel. Try to avoid touts who do not use the meter. Don't try to tell the taxi driver the name of the hotel; they will not know what you're saying. Ask the taxi driver to phone the hotel if they don't understand where you are going. Airport-to-hotel taxi fare is around 100 yuan; to repeat myself, ask the taxi driver to phone the hotel to get directions, before departing the airport. (Use body language, not English, to communicate this! If you know Chinese, need I say more....)B. TIPPING. In restaurants, this is not required; if the service is very good, you may, if you feel generous, give a 5% tip. I had a 210 yuan meal at one restaurant, gave a 10 yuan tip, and the waitress beamed with gratitude. At the hotel, no tips are required. However, I highly recommend you give a nice tip to staff who have showered you with personal attention. If you come from a country where tipping is common, then go ahead-- the local staff will not complain:)C. SAFETY: Beijing is safe. Period. D. CONVENIENCE STORES: There are two 7-Eleven just a 3-minute walk from the hotel. Ask the concierge. There is also a French supermarket store, Carrefour, a 10-minute walk away. This supermarket is modern, and very well stocked; it closes at 10PM. If you need a last minute souvenir or to buy Chinese tea, go there, or to the nearby Gate Mall. You don't have to break your wallet.E. PEKING and TSINGHUA Universities. If you are visiting these universities, ask the taxi driver to bring you to the WEST gate. That's the pretty part of the universities. The students are the amongst the best in China, or should we say, in the world; looking at them going about their daily student life was fascinating . I congratulated myself for visiting these universities.F: SHOPPING: It really doesn't make sense to spend your valuable time shopping when you should be visiting all the great sights in Beijing.G: Subway--it's safe, fast and lets you see the real people of Beijing. And the best part is that it costs less than US$0.3 per trip, regardless of the distance. This must be the most highly subsidized subway in the world, and, Dear Traveler, you are getting the subsidy too. The way to go....H. ONLY TIME FOR ONE SIGHT. If you have time for only ONE tourist sight, I would say go to the Great Wall. It shows the creativity, ability, and tenacity of the Chinese. Forbidden City and Tiananmen are number two. Don't forget, the Great Wall was built, mainly by hand, more than 2000 years ago; the Forbidden City, built in the 1400s, is a new kid on the block.I. FOOD. Ask the concierge to point you to the nearby shopping mall, &quot;Gate Mall&quot;, where there are many reasonably priced restaurants--including, oh no, KFC, Pizza Hut and McDonald's. OK, there's Starbucks. Hey, this is China....I did visit three magazine-recommended restaurants: Ganges(Indian), which is good and reasonably priced; Hatsune, a Japanese restaurant, which is expensive, and moderately good; and &quot;No name&quot; Chinese restaurant, which is in an interesting setting, expensive, and moderately good.J. MONEY. You rarely hear &quot;Yuan&quot; being said. You hear mostly &quot;Kuai&quot;, which means &quot;Yuan&quot;!K. Pronunciation. Foreigners will have difficulty with the &quot;X&quot; and the &quot;Q&quot; in the transliteration of Chinese names. Well, pronounce &quot;X&quot; like &quot;S&quot;, and &quot;Q&quot; like &quot;Ch&quot;. So &quot;Xin&quot; becomes &quot;Sin&quot; and &quot;Qing&quot; becomes &quot;Ching&quot;. Not perfect, but close enough for you to be understood. L. CROWNE PLAZA ZHONGGUANCUN---Yes.Have a pleasant stay in Beijing! Jun 1 2009 	Fantastic Hotel and Staff!	My wife and I stayed in this hotel from May 29th to June 1st, 2009. We were very impressed with everything in the hotel. It's brand-new and the staff were fantastic, extremely friendly and really went out of their way to make us feel welcome and to see we were well cared for. We were able to get a great &quot;special&quot; rate on the hotel website. We only paid RMB 603/night and we had a great room. It was very large, the bathroom was huge, and the bed was fabulous.The hotel is located close to Qinghua University and the Qinghua Science Park, where we were doing some training over the weekend, so it is in a very convenient location if you need to be near the Science Park. The food in the main floor restaurant, where we ate one dinner and three buffet breakfasts, was okay, although we would not say it was fantastic. However, the service in the restaurant was super, especially a young female server named Ethel was super friendly. She remembered our names and called us by them each morning when she saw us in the restaurant. Actually, as I have already mentioned, all of the staff were just super. We can't say enough about this hotel, we would absolutely stay there again when in Beijing for business. Dec 31 2008 	fabulous hotel	hotel seemed quite new, taxi driver dont know the location,but all in all its a fantastic stay,all staff really nice,our room was large and comfortable and very clean,the food is really good ,I had business lunch and dimsum in chinese restaurant called rouge,its quite something different , very good value for money. Dec 31 2008 	very good valeu for money	I had a good and warm welcome upon my arrival , room comfortable enough space .  I had also a good relaxing time at the pool surprisinlgy warm water .Mixs italian tepan grill restaurant is a new concept as i was explained , the food prepared was really good &quot; all cooked in front of you&quot; with tremendous care for small details , the chocoalte cake and ice cream called gelato with mocha cafe was a fantastic end ( compliment by the chef )Breakfast in valley cafe was good , definetly is an hotel that i would reccomend to others .Hope soon to be back . Nov 6 2008 	Enjoyed the stay	I spent a week in the Crowne Plaza Zhongguancun. I found the rooms to be very comfortable, quiet, and overall a very positive experience. None of the taxis I took knew where it was, and I believe this is the first review of this property on TripAdvisor - I learned when I arrived that it had only been open for 1 month! They were still working on a few of the floors, and neither the pool or spa were open. The food was quite good - I only experienced the (abundant) breakfast buffet and roomservice, but I understand there are several restaurants. Service in general was a bit spotty, not just in the restaurant, but all around, as the staff seemed quite new, and English was a little weak for a number of the employees. That said, they sure tried hard!The neighborhood immediately around the hotel doesn't seem to have much to offer, so I was glad I had the comfort and fast internet connection in the hotel as a distraction!I would recommend staying here for anyone with business in this part of Beijing. However, if you business needs are across town, be forewarned that traffic can be atrocious!"
"Handy for the airport	I have stayed at this airport a couple of times, selecting it for its proximity to the airport. The first time I stayed was shortly after the Olympic Games. The hotel was practically empty and the service was attentive, friendly but occasionally haphazard. On my next visit I had just arrived from North Korea - which probably enhanced my appreciation of the hotel! The bar, on both my stays, was virtually empty but offered good international sports coverage on TV. The shuttle service to the airport worked well. Word of warning: taxi drivers have difficulty finding the hotel, even if you show them the address in Chinese. One evening I had to use my - very! - limited Chinese to help the driver find the hotel. Nov 10 2009 	Excellent for the airport not for the city...	Similar thoughts to others. Great for the airport but theres nothing around the hotel and it would be a decent taxi fare to anywhere in the city. Entrance of the hotel is very smart, lobby is very open with a glass ceiling. No one else was checking in or out so we had fast service unlike other comments I noted from people, my experience was good and the staff were friendly. Room. Excellent and large, as this was our last night in China I had booked a suite. It was large, very! seperate lounge with toilet. There was internet access but you had to pay, the first hotel all holiday that wasnt free, a bit dissapointing given this was a suite and something the hotel should look at in my opinion. The room also included access to the club lounge which was very nice. Free drinks and nibbles for 2 hours at night. A good selction of foods and various drinks available. Very quiet while we were there. Level of English from the staff was good, not as good as some places but enough to get by.We also ate in the cafe which did bar type meals, quality was good, price was a bit high but not too over the top. Breakfast was very good and the usually options of western and asian. We used the shuttle bus to the airport which you need to book with the concierge. It was free and prompt. Overall an excellent hotel but I would only recommend it for liesure if its your 1st or last night stay. I wouldnt want to be based here as theres nothing around the hotel to see and you are a long way from the centre, see my review of the Park Plaza for a better located hotel! The hotel is very smart though and was very quite while we were there, I expect if there is a conference nearby it will be packed so you might want to check before. Oct 24 2009 	nice but only if you have patient and time	This hotel is located directly at the new exhibition center (5 min walking).It's a newer hotel with many nice rooms and good breakfast.But this hotel is not normal crown standard. The service seams to be overstrained:1. We have made a reservation one week before. We also got a receipt by fax. But when we arrived at 10pm, after a long business day and travel, there was no room. It takes about 45min and long discussions to get a room. That's worse!2. For check out you need plenty of time. For us it takes about 40 minutes. The reason is, that this is a huge hotel, but they have more security staff than receptionist. There are only 3 receptionist at the desc and they are overextended. It takes about 20 minutes to get a bill.  I don't know why. They already have got a reservation with company name. They have my passport from check-in. But for checkout, they have to write everything in the computer (and very slowly).3. During breakfast it is better to get the coffee by your own, because there is less staff. Also you need some more table for the old dishes.The hotel is nice, but you need a lot of time for everything. I don't know why they have so view staff. They need more employees and better organisation/management.It's too expensive for so low standard. Oct 14 2009 	Strange Room But Otherwise Nice--And Good Location	We stayed here for one night en route to another destination. Its primary advantage is that it is close to the airport. The airport shuttle worked well for us. The hotel staff were friendly, and the overall quality of the hotel is good. If you are looking for a place to stay that will give you easy access to the major sites of Beijing, this is not the right place, but for access to the airport it is great. The only thing that really put us off (but it put us off quite a lot) was the strange bathroom. I don't know if all rooms are this way, but ours had a large window from the bathroom into the bedroom--basically, the whole wall was a window. This is not a plus in my book, though somebody obviously thought it was. There were blinds that you could close over the window, which was fine unless either the blinds did not close tightly, or a piece of one of the slats was missing. In our case, the blinds had both features, which meant that there was not very good privacy in the bathroom. Maybe I'm a privacy freak, but come on. Other than that, the room was fine, and the hotel served its purpose. I'd still probably recommend it--but hey, fix those blinds! Oct 13 2009 	Great Hotel	Great hotel the rooms were very good and the staff were very efficient and helpful. Location to the airport is good but there is not much near the hotel if you are staying for any length of time this could be an issue. Sep 19 2009 	Good Value for the money	We stayed at the hotel one night before taking off to Europe. The room was nice and clean. Breakfast and service was ok, nothing extra but very decent. There is nothing to see or in the surroundings.The hotel is good value for the money if you have to stay near the airport. we paid 400 RMD for a King Sized bedroom. Sep 18 2009 	Great location for an exhibition hotel; terrible location for sightseeing	Stayed here for 6 nights in September for an exhibition at the NCIEC. Location is close to the exhibition centre, but still not really walking distance, especially since our event used the north entrance. There are also not a great deal of amenities in the area, plus walking anywhere aroud there is risky (from a traffic perspective). It is clear that the area is still being developed, so maybe local amenities and pedestrian friendly access will improve over time. Many attendees did some sightseeing before, after, or during the exhibition. It's a long cab ride to central Beijing: anywhere from 40 minutes to well over an hour, depending on traffic. If being a tourist is your main reason for being in Beijing, stay elsewhere. If you're coming for the Exhibition Centre, or need a hotel relatively close to the airport, then this is a good one. (Attendees staying at other, more central hotels had to leave an hour earlier than we did in the morning just to get to the Exhibition Centre in time.)The staff were all extremely polite and usually quite effective. However, they were also fairly slow, at least by North American standards. Drinks in the lounge or restaurant definitely took their time in coming. English proficiency was a problem for some, but many others seemed to have a good grasp of the language. Food in the Crowne Cafe was pretty good, with quite a large variety of Asian and western foods, especially for the buffet breakfast. Had a standard room which met all my requirements, but wasn't anything over and above what I'd expect from a hotel like this (in room safe, nice bathroom, internet...) although it did still smell fairly new. My only real complaint about the room itself was the shower... Water leaked through the shower door and onto the floor. Others indicated the same thing occurred in their rooms as well. I thought the fitness centre was rather small, but in retrospect, in the times that I used it, I never did see people having to wait to use equipment. There is a sauna and steam room as well, but both were cold when I was there, and I didn't feel like waiting for them to warm up. The equipment is very good quality and appears well maintained. Bring your headphones and you can watch an individual TV on the cardio equipment. On the way back home, a colleague and I used the hotel's shuttle to the airport. No problems at all. It left when they said it would and took us right to Terminal 3 (after fighting some traffic). Sep 3 2009 	Very kind staffs	I chose this hotel because I had to transit at Beijing and the next flight was 7:30 a.m.I had an afternoon to spend in Beijing and the staffs were kind enough to give me a consult on sightseeing. All of the staffs were kind and friendly, and they spoke good English.The rate was reasonable, rooms were clean and very comfortable.Although there was nothing near the hotel, I think it's a really good place to stay if transit is your main purpose of the stay in Beijing. Aug 18 2009 	Top class hotel	The hotel was fantastic. Clean, quiet, staff very helpfull and courteous. Food was good. Plenty of bars and lounges to relax in. Rooms spacious and well equipped. Not much around the hotel if you need a corner shop. When you come out of the airport do not go to the hotel reservations desk for help finding the courtesy bus as they will tell you it is not running at that time and charge you alot for one of their cars. Check with hotel where to be picked up in advance. Aug 11 2009	Nice one-night stopover for tour group	I read some of the reviews and I am not surprised by the gentleman who had the poor massage experience. We had read that hotels, even 5-star ones similar to the Crowne Plaza, have people on staff willing to go the &quot;extra mile&quot; for customers who may not want it. Clearly they wanted to shame him into getting something he did not want. Fortunately, our experience was excellent, with excellent service and spacious comfortable rooms. This is truly a 5-star hotel, though it is located in an industrial area. You would NOT choose this hotel to stay in for any length of time, as you cannot really walk about outside and explore at night in a poor industrial area where people's shacks are alongside their repair garage businesses. We would only recommend this as a stopover hotel. Luckily we had a tour bus and there were no transportation or communication issues for us, but I can see where there would be for people who are not sheparded around with a Chinese guide as we were. If you want to stay in Beijing for any length of time, there is a &quot;five star row&quot; of hotels downtown. Jul 27 2009 	Disappointing business hotel.	Stayed here for business for a week. Location handy for the exhibition centre and airport nearby. We arrived after a 12-hour trip from Europe, hoping to catch the bus shuttle from the airport. Unfortunately it has left, and we didn't feel like waitíng (it is an hourly service)-we decided to take a cab instead- What an odyssey that was- even though I explained to the taxi driver where the hotel was - I speak Chinese- and I was extra polite - He [--] us about and pretended not to know where the hotel was and drove us around for 40 mins. Seemed he was not happy about having waited 3 hours for a pick-up at the hotel only to get a couple of passengers who only need a 15-min ride. Well - his chances of a tip evaporated.My boss was arriving the following day and I didn't want him to go though the same ordeal- so we asked the hotel staff to arrange this- I had to explain carefully in Chinese what to do - their English was not up to it.Having said that the room service and standard of food was pretty good. Jul 22 2009 	nice place and convenient to the airport just don't walk back from the mall	the service was exceptional, the rooms just fine, swimming pool nice altho they made you wear a shower cap we visited the euromall - great restaurants - recommend the blue frog! but don't walk back - you need a taxi there is no footpath. We booked the airport shuttle the next day and it was all very convenient. Really recommended for its proximity to the airport but not if you are staying in Beijing Jul 14 2009 	Service needs improvement	We stayed here for two nights (weekend) at the end of a business trip through China. This is a very nice hotel with comfortable rooms and it is located close to Beijing Capital Airport. However, the problem with this hotel is that the service provided by the personnel is below standard. Here are some examples: 1. Using the airport shuttle was a disaster. We had booked the shuttle at 9:30pm to bring us from the airport to the hotel. As no shuttle arrived, we called the hotel at 9:35 pm and although they mentioned that the van was on its way, it did arrive at 9:55 pm (and it is only ~ 15 minutes drive). The other day we had similar problems and hence my conclusion is that the hotel staff is not able to organize the shuttle airport pick-up properly. 2. The level of english spoken by the hotel staff is very poor. When calling the hotel about the shuttle, I could not communicate even the simplest issues (such as where is the pickup point of the shuttle?) with the front desk people or the concierge.  3. When checking out, we were charged 3 times the daily maximum internet usage (3 x RMB 120). I mentioned immediately that we had been in the hotel less than 48 hours. It took at least 10 minutes to convince the front desk people to finally admit the error, to correct it and to apologize. In summary, this is a beautiful and comfortable hotel but I would not recommend it to anyone. I cannot remember being so annoyed in a hotel about the behavior of the hotel staff over the last few years (and I travel a lot!). Hence, staying in this hotel and particularly using the hotel shuttle was a very unpleasant experience and induced a lot of unnecessary stress. May 16 2009 	Great Find	Incredible Hotel! Beautiful lobby and great rooms. The only downside is the distance from downtown - 90-100 yuan taxi ride. But, as a stopover during travel, it is very near the airport. This is a newer hotel and the staff was friendly and helped with every need. They do charge for internet access. The restaurants were very good and the staff was very attentive (even at the breakfast buffet). They offer a free shuttle to and from the airport and have a very good fitness center and spa. The hotel was very safe and quiet. An excellent place to relax before or after the flight to the US. Apr 30 2009 	Nice hotel but strange experience with the spa	I was transiting from Mongolia to Frankfurt and stayed just 1 day. It is true that the hotel is in quite an industrial location, but for a transit stay it's a good location, not far from the Airport. The staff was friendly, the airport shuttle worked well and delivered me to the Airport as scheduled. Rooms are also fine. The only problem in them is lightening. I did not manage to understand how to switch on or off various lamps. They were switching on or off all together, but not separately.However, I had a very strange (I would say, displeasing) experience with the spa. In the room I saw the advertisement that there are offers of foot massage, Chinese massage and oit massage for 180, 280 and 380 RMB respectively. I phoned the spa and asked foot massage and Chinese massage. The spa manager persuaded me to take foot massage and Chinese oil massage. The lady came into my room at 19.30 and has shown me from the menue another type of massage for RMB 520. I asked her in English to stick to the original plan, but later I discovered that she nevertheless followed the one for 520. But that's ok, can be attributed to linguistic miscommunication. Overall, she was just 21, but a good specialist in her field, Her massage looked very professional to me. However, at the end she disagreed to charge the room and insisted on cash. I had Euro only, so instead of 575 RMB (520 + service) I gave EUR 75. And that's when strange things began. She called her manager and the manager sent to my room a prostitute-looking lady who was allowed into my room by the 1st masseuse, not by me. She inspected the Euro notes, and started offering sex services - 'another kind of massage'. Imagine - after the massage I was on my bed dressed in underwear only and all this started happening in front of me!!! She was dressed in a blue uniform and even had a list of prices and service descriptions... I said 'no'. She asked 'why'. I said 'I don't have money, in order to kick her out'. She said 'You can charge credit card'. I said no. She started demonstrating her brest etc etc etc. Then when it was clear that I don't want her services, she again called spa manager and again without my permission allowed into my room one more prostitute looking lady. I shouted at them 'leave or I will call secuirity' and they left. But I had to raise from the bed and to dress in front of them, looking at me, before I did that. I admit that the hotel management may not be aware of how outrageous the spa workers became. Now I calmed down, but on that day I was extremely outraged, trust me. Throughout 10 hours journey to Franfkurt I was thinking only about that... It's unimaginable - in a 4 star facility such a thing happened. Mar 28 2009 	Nice Looking Hotel - Terrible Service	We specifically booked this hotel because of its close proximity to the Beijing Capital Airport. All of the websites also stated that the hotel offers an airport shuttle. The airport shuttle is, however, woefully unreliable. We made a reservation 6 hours prior to pick up (they required 1 hour notice). We waited 60 minutes before a representative from the hotel met us. After being told that the shuttle was on its way but delayed due to to traffic, we waited an additional 30 minutes before finally giving up and paying for a taxi. Mind you, on the way to the hotel we did not see any traffic. When we arrived at the hotel 15 minutes later the shuttle was still in front of the hotel. When we inquired about the situation, the conceirge informed us that it was our responsiblity to find the shuttle at the airport - not the other way around! We spoke to another guest (who is a frequent business traveler) about the shuttle and he told us that he just simply takes a cab because of the hotel's inability and incapacity to coordinate the logistics of the shuttle. In fact, on the morning of our departure flight, the bell boy loaded up our luggage into the shuttle. The shuttle thereafter left for the airport WITHOUT US. Unacceptable. Eventually, the hotel had a private van take us to the airport where we met up with our luggage. What a mess. The service at the hotel was terrible and we will never stay here again. We wanted to stay close to the airport for our last night in China to minimize stress the night before we returned to the U.S., and our stay here instead heightened our stress level. Stay away. Feb 9 2009 	Very nice but in the middle of nowhere	I needed a place to stay overnight while in transit from a city in China's interior (from which I had flown that afternoon), on my way back to the U.S. (to which I would fly the next morning). I chose this hotel for its location very close to the Beijing Airport . . . less than 10 minutes' away. I paid 612 RMB including breakfast.Taxi fare from the Beijing Airport to the hotel was only 22 RMB. I always dread getting into a taxi at an airport for a short-distance ride (i.e., a very low fare for a driver who may have been in a queue for hours hoping for a high fare to the center of the city), but this driver did not seem to care . . . maybe they have a provision where they can cut to the front of the line when they go back to the airport if they had a short ride. The taxi driver got a little lost on the way over, but fortunately I had the hotel's phone number with me so showed it to him so he could phone and as it turned out we were only 2 minutes away from the point of the phone call.The hotel is very nice and modern; very clean, comfortable room with high quality bedding and luxurious bathroom. I was there during the Chinese New Year holiday (in Jan 2009) and as such the hotel was eerily empty. I suspect this is primarily a business hotel and no business is done during the CNY holiday; few people travel on leisure to cold Beijing in January, and if they did, few vacationers would opt to stay in the middle of an industrialized area way out by the airport.The staff was very friendly . . . the fitness center was quite nice - large with a big glass exterior window, with free weights, about 8 weight machines, about 3-4 tread mills, a couple of ellptical machines and a couple of stair climbers. Exercise machines had individual TVs and built-in fans. The fitness center also had a large pool (though I did not use it).I'm not a spa kind of guy, but they did have a special of 60-minute foot massage for only 99 RMB, so I tried it and it was very nice.Only two downsides to this hotel, neither of which is a big deal:1. Its remote location in the midst of an industrial park type of area; there are no shops or restaurants nearby or much of anything to see or look at should you want to have an interesting leisurely stroll. So, if you are averse to mini-bars as a source for a can of diet Coke or a candy bar, be forewarned you can't just walk down the street to a convenience store.2. The English of the staff is not great; the message light on my phone was blinking . . . the instruction was to push the button to retrieve messages . . . so I pushed the button which rang the switchboard and they could not figure out what I was wanting . . . eventually they picked up my saying the word &quot;message&quot; and they interpreted it as &quot;massage&quot; so they transferred me to the spa &amp; salon. So I went downstairs to speak to the front desk and they thought I was trying to tell them that my phone was broken. Uggh!!! I later discerned that my wife had called. But I had to put up with a blinking message lights on all 3 room phones for the rest of my stay (Overnight, I covered up the lights with paper).The hotel does offer a free shuttle bus on the hour to the airport, so I used this. I was the only one on the bus.TV had usual assortment of English channels that you find in Asia . . . e.g., CNN, CNBC Asia, HBO. Jan 30 2009 	Not there yet	This Hotel is very convenient to the Airport and the Internation exhibition center. This was actually my second stay - the first was prior to the official opening.The hotel does have all the amenities that you would expect for a new property but as others have mentioned it is an extremely new staff and they just haven't had the training that you would expect in a Crowne Plaza. If you have business in the Shun Yi area by all means stay there the rooms are clean and the food is not bad. If you are looking to see the sights of Beijing - spring for a Hotel downtown so you can walk around Jan 30 2009 	Very poor service for high price and poor location	This hotel has all the mod cons and the rooms cannot be faulted but it isn't very close to the airport and the taxi drivers have no idea where it is and the hotel service element is not there.The management must be Chinese because they don't understand Western values and its inacceptable. If i am being charged Western prices then i expect Western service.I was overcharged 20 yuan for something so i pointed this out to the member of staff. She couldn't do anything about this because she had no authority...remember i have spent nearly 1000 yuan to stay here so what is 20 yuan (less than $3) so she had to call the hotel manager and the hotel manager refused to remove the $3 charge! Regardless if i am wrong or right, if a customer spending $150 is unhappy with a $3 charge then you immediately remove it. I could have just paid it but it was the principle of it. Avoid this place unless you don't mind getting fleeced. Oct 6 2008 	Great new airport hotel	The Crowne Plaza Beijing Intl Airport Hotel openned in July of 2008. The up side is that the hotel is brand new and really gorgeous. The down side is that some staff members are struggling with english. That said, the staff is very gracious and welcoming, even providing me with tea while I checked in. There are several restaurants and a lobby bar, gym, business center, broad band in rooms (120cny/day), etc - all the usual amenities for a hotel of this class. The room was quite comfortable, with high quality linens, tv with multiple english channels including CNN and HBO, bath with both marble shower and tub, bottled water of course because even here the water is not potable. There is a free shuttle to the airport on the hour. The ride takes 20 minutes. It is only 25 cny for a taxi. This is a good choice if you have an early flight or are worried about traffic delays from central Beijing. Sep 21 2009 	Sehr gutes Business-Hotel in Randlage"
"Nov 17 2009 	Dated and feels worn	I've stayed at this place over the years and liked in the past, This is the first visit in about 4 years and this time, the property feels dated. It needs a good renovation. It's functional but less than what you'd expect from a Crowne Plaza. There is a small mall nearby and you can get some restaurants at the next block, but unless you take a taxi or have someone drive you, it's not really a good location (unless you are visiting the Olympic Green, which is within easy walking distance)The breakfast buffet is OK and the day that I ate there, it was packed and the service was poor. It took 3 or 4 reminders and more than 10 minutes for them to bring new bowls out. They took the plates away quick enough but refill of coffee was slow. It still bothers me that people can smoke in the lobby. Some of the other hotels seem to not have that problem. Nov 16 2009 	Cold and comfortable what you'd expect from a 4/5 star business hotel	I stayed here towards the end of September for 4 nights. It's everything I'd expected from this class of a hotel. Comfortable, but impersonal hotel. The rooms are quite spacious and very comfortable. I had a corporate rate which included internet use, so I didn't feel the pinch of the pay-per-use internet users which I read in other reviews.The lobby is very large but had the stench of cigarettes since smoking is allowed there. Quite a number of very nice looking restaurants in the lobby but I didn't try any of them. My room was facing the courtyard (and 4th Ring road, I think), so it was a little bit noisy as they were having their Oktoberfest promotion in the tents on the ground floor. The loud music was bothering me slightly, but that's also because I'm a light sleeper and like things absolutely silent.Next door to the hotel is a small mall with a supermarket, some specialty shops as well as a food court. The food court was pretty good with very affordable prices and a variety of local food. I enjoyed eating there a number of times. It was good that I didn't have to eat in the hotel restaurants all the time, with the food court right next door available for light and simple meals.Across the road, about 10-15 minutes walk is also the Olympic park where the Birds Nest stadium and Watercube swimming arena is. It was quite a treat to be able to just walk there and see these amazing architectural marvels.The area is generally quite safe and I spent one night walking around. Some spots were quite dark but I didn't feel threatened at any time. Taxis are also readily available at the hotel.Overall, it was one of those forgettable stays when traveling for business, which is not necessarily a bad thing because the memorable ones (for business travel) are usually the ones where something bad happened! Would I stay here again? Yes, because there are no surprises and everything is as expected. Nov 4 2009 	average!	Hotel room very spaceious and nice decor, clean and well maintained. there were few things I would like to point out. firstly, for some reason, every night from 7pm there was a terrible smell comes from the drain and we tried to close the bathroom door and light a candle but it doesn't help. Secondly, there never a spoon on the table to use, and every day we have to asked the waitress or waiter for spoon and it took more than 5 minutes for a spoon to arrived, some re-organising at the breakfast tables needed. It was stated that the hotel has its indoor heated swimming pool, but it was always freezing cold water, never heated. Steam room only steam for few minutes and have to wait for over 10 minutes for steam to come on, Sauna also freezing cold. They really need to have a better system for avoiding hair going into the drains at the shower at fitness centre, as it was a pool of dirty water at your feets while having a shower, not good at all. Aug 27 2009	Beijing Crown Plaza OK stay expensive Internet	Our large group of 30 people for this company paid trip went to Beijing for 5 days, this is the hotel our travel agency put us in. The hotel itself is clean, and very nicely done. I don't know the price we got, since we got this as a packaged deal. The place is a bit far from the main city center, 30 minutes or so none traffic, but it is about 5-10 minutes walk from the 2009 Olympic Park. The place is very quiet as well, since most places around closes after 10pm. There are some small stores and restaurants around but closes after 10pm as well. Overall, I am satisified with the stay. However, if you do need internet, this trip will be expensive for you. There is NO free internet in the rooms, so you will have to pay for depending on the time you needed. There is also a business center in the 2nd floor with both English or Chinese computers that you can use as well. They can also rent out laptop/copier/fax etc if you need to. From my understanding, they do speak some English if you speak slow. Oh, the pool area also closes around 10pm, but at 9:30pm, they will not let you in anymore to use it. While we were there, very very few people used the pool, but it was very clean and quiet. The hotel gym is also very nice and clean if you decided to use it. They do have some yoga/pilate supplies if you want to use as well. Their breakfast was ok, not the best, especially when they have lots of people then they are not able bring out much variety of food. Also, we asked them to fill our water bottle, it took them about 5 minutes just to do so, so you may want to buy your water elsewhere instead. They do give 1 free bottle of water per person each day left in your room. Finally, their water is very hard water, so it made washing my hair not so pleasant experience. The last time I stayed in a Shanghai hotel I did not have this problem. Jul 20 2009 	Good hotel out of the way though	I stayed at this hotel while attending a conference at the nearby conference center. I was there for nearly a full week.Good things - * Room was in good shape, all fixtures worked properly* Comfortable bed with 4 pillows to choose from* Good working desk set-up* Helpful service in the lobby. * Good breakfast buffet* Nearby restaurants, grocery store* Good Peking Duck place within walking distance, ask the concierge* Refrigerator in room* Room service quick and good qualityThings that could have been better -* Internet access was a bit on the pricey side* Rate they listed was not the same as my confirmation, had to show them my printed confirmation to get this fixed* Location a bit out of the way for major tourist sites (with the exception of the Olympic village sights)If I were doing a general tourist itinerary, I would stay in a more central location. I was pleasantly surprised at how nice the hotel was, and had a good stay. Jun 18 2009 	a good weekend spend at this hotel !	I spent the whole weekend in this hotel with my husband and two teenage children. I have attend conference before here. This time, I find the hotel is not only good for business but also a good choose for family. We enjoyed the spacious rooms, breakfast, swimming pool. the envirement of the Yellowstone restaurant is fatastic, the BBQ dinner it offered is very ungofetble. And all the staff are very friendly! the hotel very near the Bird's Nest and Cubes, we just walk to there. Mar 12 2009 	Overall good	I stayed here 10 days for business. Compared to other Crowne Plazas the service was maybe not just up to scratch. My main complaint is that Internet access is expensive in the rooms (£12 for every 24 hours) and WLAN in the cafes/bars of the hotel is not so comfortable, and the cost of drinks you are expected to buy is high. You can sit in the lobby and access WLAN but there are not many seats. On the positive side, Internet access is made so easy.Note that 15% service charge is added on to every part of the hotel bill.During my stay the gym/pool was uder renovation, so as from March 2009 this facility should be up and running again, and pretty good. A new small shopping mall is open under the North Times Tower - only 50 metres from the main door. Here you can visit Zoe's bar who provide very nice coffee and cakes at fair prices with free WLAN access.The concierge were helpful but overall the problem is a language one.The location of the hotel is perfect from the point of view of the Birds Nest stadium and the Water Cube which you can visit about 50 RMBs each.Shopping needs a nerve with haggling and the Clothing Market can be recommended, but remember all products are probably 'seconds'. Use the subway (1.5km from hotel) and get anywhere for 2 RMBs a stretch. (Airport express is 25RMBs.)Trips are organised by the hotel. 470 RMBs to visit the Great Wall, which is a must, even if probably overpriced. Oct 16 2008 	Nice but with problems...	We spent 6 nights at this hotel, and were not too impressed with it. First of all, we were given two twin beds, and the staff was unable to find a king/queen bed room for us, even though we stayed for a 6 nights, which is a pretty long stay. They had rooms available with a queen bed, but at a higher rate, and were unwilling to give us (since we were unwilling to pay extra!). Second, unless you're into the Olympic village, which is right next to the hotel, the location is not convenient, the hotel is pretty far out, there's not much around it, and you need to take a taxi or the subway (which is 15 minutes away) to go to the attractions. Third, I needed to get train tickets to go to Shanghai, and most hotels can buy tickets for you for a small fee, well, this upscale, expensive hotel, has a travel center that would arrange only airplane tickets (at a crazy price) with a staffer who didn't speak English, no train tickets. So they ended up sending me to the post office to get my train tickets which was complicated given that I don't speak Chinese. Considering that the post office is close to the hotel, and that they have plenty of staff, and that all hotels provide train tickets, it's appalling that this pretentious hotel wouldn't help guests with such a common request, simply ridiculous! Fourth, the rate was way too high for what we got: 1,800RMB/night with only one breakfast. Given the location, and service provided. Fifth, there were some problems with the rate they initially quoted us, and with a breakfast we were overcharged for, and when we were checking out it took one hour to solve these simple issues. The nice things about this hotel are the clean, comfortable rooms, some staff speaks pretty good English, and most of all a very nice (albeit expensive, 170rmb per person!) breakfast. But overall, I wouldn't recommend it for tourists, too far out, too expensive for what you get, no help for train tickets. Sep 20 2008 	Great Hotel till........	I have been a regular for Crowne Plaza Wuzhou for the last 2 years. It has offered great service and facility for bussiness. Till I encounter the incident below.My recent stay from Sep 5th to Sep 10th has been tainted by a staff at the breakfast cafe. The staff that was preparing the omellete/chinese pancake was rather rude to be in a five star hotel like Crowne Plaza. I ordered my chinese pancake for 30 minutes it was not served, and during the interval 3 reminders was given to him. The staff did not even offered an appology. Hope the hotel management can look into the black horse that tainted a great hotel Jul 16 2008 	An excellent Hotel	Stayed here for a congress at the nearby conference centre. The hotel was excellent and the staff friendly, helpful and competent. Rooms were spotless with room service 3 times a day. Breakfast was a huge buffet with cooks on hand to make scrambled eggs or whatever you wished . Breakfast consisted of Chinese, English and European food with lots of fruit etc. The coffee could have been better but otherwise excellent. I would definately stay here again. Jun 30 2008 	Nice hotel great gym.	I stayed at this hotel for a recent meeting, which was held in the hotel itself. It's an excellent facility, and I highly recommend it. The rooms are nice, as you'd expect at this price point. The breakfast buffet is ample, and covers about five different cuisines! The hotel gym/pool is great. As a swimmer, I was impressed that the pool was long enough (probably about 50 feet) to do laps, and square enough to do flip turns on both ends.The hotel is on the 4th ring road, very close to the olympic venues. If you want to get into Beijing center (eg forbidden city) it's about a 30 yuan cab ride that took us 20-45 minutes depending on traffic.If you do not speak Mandarin, I'd recommend that you get the chinese characters for the hotel name/address printed out on paper before you arrive at the airport. Not all the taxi drivers at the airport could read the English name/address that I had printed out from the hotel website.All in all though, this is a great choice, particularly if you need to be north of Beijing during your trip. May 9 2008 	Two Weeks...was pretty nice	I had a business trip to the Technology Park (Motorola, Nortel, Ericsson) and had a two week stay at the Crown. Overall, I would have to say the experience was excellent. The staff was excellent. The breakfast buffet was amazing and the location was decent for a stay to Beijing. Tourism wise, most of your destinations that are outside of Beijing are towards the North. Its a bit of a walk to the subway (prob a mile) but there are plenty of Taxis available too. They have a shuttle for folks heading out to the tech park though too. Thats a nice touch! Kudos for that.Its next to the Olympic park so thats pretty neat. Laundry is REALLY expensive so pack accordingly. There are plenty of places to eat close to the hotel too.Drinks are expensive....but here is a little hint. Right next to the elevators is a &quot;staff only&quot; entrance. There is a Coke machine thats super cheap right by the door. Shhh.Overall, it was an excellent experience. Then again, Im easy to please and it was on the company dime. Mar 22 2008 	TIred	Stayed for 2 nights at the club level of Crowne Plaza Wuzhou. The hotel is adjacent to the BICC, which was the main purpose of our visit to Beijing. Hotel looked impressive from the outside. Staff generally courteous, helpful and many can speak English. Lobby alright except for the smell of cigarette smoke. Only 3 lifts available during our visit as the other 3 were undergoing renovation. Club lounge does not serve food or snacks, only has limited variety of drinks available. Room was spacious. However thermostat was not working well. Even though it was cold outside (7C), the room was stuffy without much ventilation so we ended up having to open the windows to let the cool breeze in. Room safe available, bath amenities provided, apples available in the room and in hallway. Generally not raving about the hotel. Would be better to stay in another hotel for the price we paid. Major construction undergoing on adjacent lot, so expect noise at night, which we heard despite staying on the 15th floor (hotel max 17 levels). Mar 2 2008	Great Location	The Crowne Plaza is right opposite the Olympic Stadium in Wuzhou. The hotel is very clean, modern and comfortable. The staff are as helpful as possible but there are quite often language barrier problems. The hotel has several restuarants all reasonably priced and very nice. Hotel staff assisted with bookings to visit Great Wall, Tianamen Square, Forbidden City etc either via taxi or with tour guide. There are several good restuarants, supermarket and shopping area about a 5-10 minute walk from the hotel. The pool and gym area also very good. Jan 12 2008 	Excellent hotel for Olympic guests a bit far from center of city	The Crowne Plaza Wuzhou is a bit further away from central Beijing, but it is situated right next to most of the Olympic sports venues and is not far from the fashionable Chaoyang district. The hotel has an impressive look and feel to it, and the lobby and lobby bar are superb. Staff is friendly and speaks very good english. The hotel is spotlessly clean, and looks very new. The rooms are very spacious and nicely decorated, giving the feel of luxury. The view from my room at least was very nice indeed. Dec 30 2007	Recommended	This is a very nice hotel indeed. Very high standard, nice rooms, and a surprisingly large heated swimming pool.Just a five minute walk from the hotel there is a small shopping area, with a few restaurants.Definitely recommended for Beijing.Dew. Oct 26 2007 	Pleasantly surprised	I went to Beijing for a conference and this hotel was right next to the BICC. It's in the Olympic village area, but not suitable for people doing business downtown. I was pleasantly surprised at the standard of the hotel - spotless, young, polite staff with a lot of initiative, excellent restaurant etc. My 'Deluxe' room was huge with the bathroom bigger than a hotel room in Tokyo. Everything worked and I was impressed by how clean it was. Being a Chinese national, I must say I am proud of the amazing progress of my country and its people. Bravo, Beijing, I hope you won't let us down in 2008! Oct 15 2007 	Great hotel for Olympics	The Crown Plaza Wuzhou is an excellent 5star hotel. Clean, spacious well appointed rooms with helpful English speaking staff. The breakfast buffet had everything you could wish for, both western and chinese, including freshly squeezed fruit and vegetable juices made to order, which made a great start to the morning. The Brazilian restaurant was excellent and made a welcome change to chinese food.We stayed here while attending a conference as it is adjacent to the Conference Centre, but it is about a 45minute taxi ride to the center of Beijing. However it is across the road from the Olympic stadium and with the opening of the new metro lines next year it will be a perfect place to stay. Jul 31 2007 	Perfect hotel for short trip	This hotel was really a star in comparing to other nearing hotels. It is 5-star hotel and have really good service and rooms. Rooms are quite not fully luxurious, but above the average. Rooms were always clean, good smells, beds comfortable, and everything worked. The room was on the small side but perfectly adequate for three (two adults and one child). Breakfast was really excellent - with foods from almost every continents. The hotel's location is its main drawback, being some 30 til 45 minutes of driving with taxi from the center, where are all touristic locations are. This will change next year (in 2008) after they will finish subway (metro), which will be located right on the corner of the hotel. In that case this hotel will be best bed for families. Only weather and air pollution is in July in Beijing really bad. Tourist should go to Beijing only in October or at the beginning of November and avoid comming in summer months.I will always recommend the hotel to all. Mar 27 2007 	Enjoyed our stay	We stayed at this hotel in January 2007. My husband was in Beijing on business travel and stayed here for three weeks. We found the hotel to be very nice, clean, and the service to be excellent during our stay. Please be aware that this hotel is not located in downtown Beijing where all the tourist sites are, so be prepared to take a taxi if you stay here. You won't be able to walk to the sites from the hotel. However, taxis are constantly dropping off people at the hotel, so getting a taxi to take you downtown is not a problem and the price is not expensive. One thing I'd like to mention is that this hotel is within walking distance of the Olympic Stadium for the 2008 Summer Olympics and appears to be very close to where all the olympic activities in Beijing will be held. If you are planning to visit for the Olympics, I believe this hotel will be in very close proximity to the events. We definitely enjoyed our stay here. It seemed to be a favorite amongst business travelers. The hotel restaurants and room service were very good. The breakfast buffet catered to everyone with international cuisines from american, european, and asian. The pool and gym facilities were very nice too. We would definitely stay here again if we had to return to Beijing. Jan 24 2007	Excellent Dining Experience	Stayed in this hotel for 5 nights. The rooms very frankly tired and in need of refurbishment, however very clean. Beds were firm and very comfortable. Options are for a king bed or 2 large king singles and as we were there with our 6 year old child a roll in bed was offered and worked well. I would consider the rooms overheated but we were able to get the window opened for fresh air. Without doubt dining at &quot;cafe Asia&quot; was outstanding and run by an Australian Executive chef catering to all tastes. The cost was very reasonable (148 rmb for dinner buffet) per person and the child free. We ate all our meals in Cafe Asia as it was so diverse, exciting and fresh that you could not do better outside. I would definately stay here again as what the rooms lacked in glamour was more than compensated by the dining experience. Aug 24 2006	A real five star Hotel	I stayed there for about one week at the end of June for the attendance of a conference. This is probably the best five star hotel I have ever been.Staff were most polite and helpful (as one would expect from Chinese culture?). Just an example, I asked for a plug adaptor from Chinese to European. They came immediatly bringing a variety (!!!) of equipment for every posible scenario. Room service was also very fast and good. The room was very large and clean, and contained everything one can possibly need. Breakfast also included everything a reasonable person can ask for. There are three restaurants in the hotel (at least, I found three). I used only the one next to the Palm lobby(?). They have an excellent buffet for dinner which includes great variety and very good quality in both wester and easter cuisine. Staff in the restaurant are also very polite and efficient (some times their English is not very good, but we have to be understanding). The two other restaurants have cantonese (that is of southern China) and meat dishes, but I did not try them as the buffet completely covered me and my friends. The area in which the hotel is located is rather rich and upcoming and there are shops and a large supermarket less than 10' walk from the hotel. The olympic stadium that will host the 2008 Olympic games is very near the hotel. The hotel is between 20 and 40 minutes (depending on the time of the day) from Tiananmen square. Given how cheap taxis are in China, it is in a very good location. Jul 13 2006	Problems with the staff	Stayed at this hotel using rewards nights with hotels priority club points and hotel voucher from travel agent. Staff on VIP floor had difficulties comprehending simple questions in english. Had to deal with assistant managers in order to get reservations clarified. Stayed there for eleven nights and staff did not resolve hotel voucher reservation problem until the day of check out. Had to spend several hours of my time requesting the staff to clarify the problem. Same problem and attitude dealing with staff at front desk in the Lobby level. Had difficulty exchanging traveller's cheques or Canadian/american currency at the front desk. Ended up having to walk to nearby bank to exchange travellers cheques. Better to just take out amount needed from ATM machine in the lobby.The hotel was very comfortable otherwise. The rest of the staff in the restaurant, fitness room, pool, housekeeping, concierge provided excellent service. Hotel and rooms very clean. Carpets in the rooms and hallways could use a washing. Approximately 30 minutes outside of downtown core. Cost 35 to 40 RMB to travel by taxi to most places. Book the &quot;Club&quot; rooms. Rate includes breakfast upstairs in the Club Lounge or downstairs restaurant. Club rate also includes cocktails in the afternoon and use of internet services. May 26 2006	Perfect if you have business around there	(Sorry about my english) Due to bookingerror at the CP Qingdao I spent 1 night an the CP Park view. I can say that you are treated like a VIP in this hotel. Big (club) room, perfect breakfast, very nice personel. My internet problems were solved within a moment. Location is very outside the center of Beijing therefore i changed to the CP in the center with no problems. Club manager was perfect!!! I can recommend it for business! Mar 31 2006 	great hotel for business travellers and couples	I travel to Beijing often and have stayed at several hotels over the years, but this one is great! Attentive service, clean, comfortable rooms, friendly staff and a good set of restaurants. lots of really good restaurants close by as well for more local flavor (especially hot pots and peking duck). Concierge is very knowledgeable and helpful. terrific beds and pillows and great bath robes. good value for my money Dec 20 2005 	great brazilian restaurant!	In November I had to spend a couple of weeks on a business trip in Asia. I also went to Beijing. My company booked me into the Crowne Plaza Park View. Altogether I had a really good stay-experience. The hotel is pretty new and the facilities are what you would expect from a five star hotel. A couple of asian restaurant, big pool, etc. What I liked best about the hotel was its brazilian restaurant though. I was longing for some meat after all this asian food and that is what I got. The waiter comes to your table and slices down as much meat, sausage, etc. as you want. I thought it was a pretty cheap all you can eat deal as well. Recommended if you are into meat!

"Excellent - would stay here again	Aside from location, this hotel is superb. I was very impressed with the receptionist, Mr Tim Tian, at check-in. We checked in at an unconventional time in the morning and most hotels would not be able to accommodate us at that hour. Mr Tian must have seen how tired we were and let us check in earlier then usual. The room is spacious/clean and bed was very comfortable. The dessert I had from room service was lacking - guess I shouldn't have such high expectations. Buffet breakfast was great - excellent selection and strong coffee.Would be better value for money if internet was wireless and free. They currently charge RMB 120 for 24 hours. The hotel is very much out of the way, but Parkson is opening next door and I'm sure the area will be much more happening soon.Would have given a 5-star rating for service, but their concierge needs improvement. The storage is so far away, it takes them forever to retrieve stored luggage. I guess for the same reason, bus boys are often walking to or in the storage area and is absent from the concierge counter. Sep 6 2009 	Almost Perfect	The hotel is relatively new, room is spacious, staff very obliging. Buffet was great with a lot of choices. The only thing did not earn this hotel full marks is its location, almost in the middle of building sites, near the major ring road. quite isolated for us who like to wonder around the hotel to soak in the local admosphere and use the public transport. The underground is quite hidden near the hotel. It took a bit of searching to find the entry. However, if you like taxi here and there, then the location is going to be fine. Aug 30 2009	One of the best hotels I have stayed in.	This is definitely a great hotel. It is very luxurious, and the staff are there to cater for any whim at the drop of a hat. The rooms are large, the beds very comfortable, and the bathroom was really good too with plenty of room, complimentary bathrobes and slippers etc.The reason this hotel was so good in my view was the food. Fabulous buffet breakfast with everything and anything you could possible want. The restaurant in the evenings was also buffet, but very cleverly had 7 or 8 sections with food from different parts of the world, Italian, Indian, etc. so every palate was catered for, if for example you are not a lover of Chinese food. Overall, the hotel is excellent. The location was OK, but as we were on a guided trip the location was not an issue, as we were picked up and dropped off every day. Jul 15 2009 	Amazing!	Amazing hotel, was very impressed by the rooms. The bed was very comfortable and was just as comfortable as my own bed back home. Had a wonderful night's rest here. The buffet breakfast is out of this world too, good selection of both western and chinese cuisines.Front reception staff and concierge and bell boys spoke english.Would definately stay again, but the hotel location is a little bit out of the way and not too much to see and do within walking distance of the hotel.However, this hotel is excellent and would recommend it!! May 14 2009 	New elegant place	Very nice hotel. Its new and fresh. Rooms are pretty big and have a trendy design. I really liked the bathrooms which had separate shower and tub. All in natural stone and glass. And a cool window above the tub. The breakfast was really great during the weekdays, however not so well maintaned on the weekend. Seems like they stopped refilling cheese, juices, fruits even if it was still more than one hour before closing the breakfast. This is not a downtown hotel but location is Ok, not so bad as some reviewers have written, even though there is contruction going on everywhere around the hotel. But this is typical for Beijing. There are some restaurants within 10 minutes walking distance (one of these is a really good local restaurant serving the typical Peking Duck). The hotel concierge service is GREAT. Very helpful with everything. The front desk staff was also very service minded and flexible. The hotel has a nice spa with swimming pool and saunas. Finally, as other reviewers have stated - most taxi drivers have a hard time finding the hotel. Make sure you have a note with hotel phone number, name and address in chinese letters to show the driver. May 11 2009 	Great stay	My family and I spent 8 days total at the Crowne Plaza Sun Palace Hotel in May, 2009 over two different periods. Our basic premise for choosing the hotel was 1)it allowed for more than 1 kid in the room; 2)it seemed like a new, clean and 4-5* hotel; and 3)great price/value for the hotel.We were not disappointed one bit - in fact we came to think of our hotel as our &quot;temporary home&quot; and were really able to relax and refresh from our long days out sightseeing.The best thing about the hotel was definitely the service. From top to bottom everybody was extremely nice and helpful and friendly. Our two kids (aged 3 and 1) were immediately given lots of attention. The staff from the front desk to the concierge to the bell staff to the hotel management called us by name the entire trip. The concierge really tried hard to help us out by getting train tickets ahead of our stay, which another hotel in another city refused to do for us.The rooms were brand new and comfortable. Nicely appointed and tastefully done. The hotel itself is still a bit of a work-in-process. There is an adjoining complex that houses ballrooms, event facilities, restaurants and a spa. Two of the restaurants (both Chinese) are open, while the Italian restaurant is yet to be opened.The knock we read about on the hotel is that it was out of the way. And yes it is and no it isn't. It's not close to the center of Beijing, and by the center I mean Forbidden City. The hotel is on the third ring, and you can tell that in another five years the landscape will look a lot different from where it is today. Lots of construction going on. Nevertheless, we trucked the family to the neighboring subway station (2-3 minute walk) and were in town rather quickly (i.e. one transfer). We were surprised by a few really good restaurants in the area that were within walking distance. It's not the kind of hotel where you're going to leave in the morning, come back for lunch and then leave again in the afternoon. Pretty much when we left, we were gone from morning until evening and we came back for the night.There is a pool, which was great for the kids. While the kiddie pool and hot tub looked to be undergoing some renovation we were able to sneak a corner of the lap pool for ourselves to swim with the young kids.We tried two of the restaurants and they were fairly expensive and on par with most western restaurants. What would have cost us $10 at a local restaurant would cost us $50 at the hotel. To be expected. The food was good. There is a good Sunday buffet with lots of Asian fare (Chinese, Japanese, Indian) and a chocolate fountain to boot. Evening live music in the lobby. Most everyone spoke English.Taxis were waiting to take us into town or where ever we wanted to go from the hotel. We had only one issue with a cab flat our refusing to take us to our hotel from a place near the Zoo. We attribute this mostly to the Golden Week mad house and not the actual location of the hotel. The hotel had a easy English and Chinese map with directions to give to any cab.All in all, I would highly recommend this hotel if there are people who are looking for a great hotel at a great value. I think once this hotel is 100% finished and operational, combined with the neighborhood being fully developed and you're probably looking at rates being twice as high at least. Apr 5 2009 	Superb Hotel .WOW !!!!	Stayed here for a week and can't say enough about it, The food here is the very best the buffet diiners and breakfasts are out of this world. Our room was huge and spotless , great beds to sleep on after a hard days sightseeing. The staff were very friendly and helpfull. We shall be back.... Mar 7 2009 	Amazing Family Value for Northwest Beijing	We picked this hotel for its location, close to our son's boarding school and subway lines. We love China, but it sure was nice to be in this amazingly clean new hotel with its large beautiful clean pool and fitness center. Compared to other hotels in the area it is an amazing value, and it has the best pool we've experienced in China. Clean, comfortable rooms with comfortable beds. The high quality buffet breakfast has plenty of fresh fruits, omelets, pastries... It's a short walk to the #2 and #10 subway line so you can ride anywhere you need to go. We did have to pay extra for internet, and it was so new it wasn't on gps yet so hard to find. We are already booked to go back! Mar 2 2009 	Good short stay	Spend three nights at this hotel; from January 13-January 17, 2009. Upon arrival we were greeted by the bellhop, and the check in was a breeze. The room is nicely arranged with all the modern convience; the sitting stone stool in the shower is a big plus. My wife and I did utilize the gym and the indoor pool at the hotel; the free weights and treadmill keep us from gaining too much weight while indulging ourselves with good Chinese food. We had our breakfast every morning at the lobby restaurant; it is included with our room. The breakfast is good, you have your choice of American/Japanese/Chinese. However, I thought the dinner buffet was bit overpriced and the food wasn't that good. We never had the chance to dine at the other two restaurants at the establishment (Yunan cusine and Cantonese Seafood); perhaps next time around. There are plenty of restaurants near by the hotel, a short cab ride would get you there. The only negative part of this particular hotel is that it is brand new, and 3 out of 5 cab drivers required us to give them specific direction to get to the hotel. Overall, we liked this hotel: 1. the price $100 per night 2. the service 3. it is new. Feb 21 2009 	Great place but inconvenient location	Stayed there nearly 10 days while looking for an apartment. The price was very good and the hotel and rooms quite nice. Definitely 5-star decoration.However the location of the hotel is not convenient. It is close to nothing except some construction sites. You cannot go out in the evening for a walk, there is nothing to see, no restaurant, no shops, nothing. There is no taxi queue at the hotel so they have someone get you one from the street. The hotel is on a one-way street along the expressway. So when you get a taxi and wish to to to the city center or on Ring Road 3, the taxi is going in opposite direction and results in a detour of about 4km.On the other hand the subway (line10) is 10-15 walking distance and the best way to get around as if you take a taxi back to your hotel and even show the driver the hotel business card he will have no clue where this is. most of the time I had to help the driver with my limited mandarin.In any case, if you don't mind the location and are willing to take the subway, this ios great value. Nov 2 2008	Would Stay Again	We recently spent 2 nights here last week. We were pleasantly surprised with the size of the room and amenities. There is a very good breakfast buffet (by Chinese standards) that includes many pastries, an Indian section, Chinese section, Japanese section, juice, fruit, salads, hot foods with baked beans, broiled tomatoes, mushrooms, meats and to-order eggs. Also a waffle/pancake section. We never had as good a breakfast for the next 9 days. We stayed on the 12th floor. The glass shower door leaks out on the floor if it gets too much water on it. This was reported throughout our friends rooms. The views from our side of the hotel covered many of the national bird of china. The Crane. As in Construction. Oct 13 2008 	Yunnan comes to Beijing	A new (opened August 2008) hotel in Beijing's North East. Its got a Yunnan theme and a business/high end focus. At times there seems to be more staff waiting to serve than guests but this should hopefully improve as it becomes more widely known.Rooms are comfortable with a large bathroom. (Rainshower head and separate bath). Reported a couple of minor maintenance issues and they were fixed efficiently and graciously within 8 hours. Surrounded by construction activity, it looks a little isolated. (cannot hear construction tho, and wont last long given Beijings phenominal transformation rate).Easy to access from the third ring road if you're headed to the west but the one way road system makes it hard to reach if you are travelling the third ring road in an easterly direction. 5-10 minute walk to a subway station (Shaoyaoju). I got a electronic swipe card and travelled easily around the city. Subway has good graphics and English support for figuring out where to get on and off. Taxi rank that quickly gets you a cab if you want door to door service.Food and beverage on the dear side.Friendly staff with plenty of English speakers.(Didn't test other languages, sorry!)

WEC Spa: Audi presents long-tail R18 -First fielding of three Audi R18 e-tron quattro cars -Premiere of a new aerodynamic variant -Last race preparation for the Le Mans 24 Hours Audi is pursuing ambitious aims at round 2 of the FIA World Endurance Championship (WEC) on May 4 at Spa. The version of the Audi R18 e-tron quattro that was victorious at the season opener is to extend Championship leader Audi's points advantage. At the same time, a new ""long-tail"" variant of the hybrid sports car will be tested in Belgium. Audi is pursuing ambitious aims at round 2 of the FIA World Endurance Championship (WEC) on May 4 at Spa. The version of the Audi R18 e-tron quattro that was victorious at the season opener is to extend Championship leader Audi's points advantage. At the same time, a new ""long-tail"" variant of the hybrid sports car will be tested in Belgium. Comparison in racing conditions: Two versions of the Audi R18 e-tron quattro that, also visually, can be clearly distinguished from each other will be running at Spa. The winners of the opening round, Loïc Duval/Tom Kristensen/Allan McNish (F/DK/GB), and the current World Endurance Champions Marcel Fässler/André Lotterer/Benoît Tréluyer (CH/D/F), will be starting with the aerodynamic variant that was victorious at Silverstone. It generates optimal downforce for track types such as the 7.004-kilometer circuit at Spa. The third Audi R18 e-tron quattro, driven by Marc Gené/Lucas di Grassi/Oliver Jarvis (E/BR/GB), on the other hand uses an aero package that has been optimized for the high-speed Le Mans track and can be recognized by its lengthened rear section. The comparison, however, is not focused on absolute lap times. Instead, the team will analyze the time differences to be expected between both models on individual track sectors. In addition, practical aspects of using the second body version will be reviewed and data generated for the fielding in the race at Le Mans. The focal point of the spectators' interest will yet again be the thrilling battle between World Champion Audi and challenger Toyota. In the seven meetings that have taken place since last June, the score is at 4-3 for the sports cars from Ingolstadt and Neckarsulm in the competition with Japan. The Spa 6 Hours will be held on Saturday of the first weekend in May. The TV channel Eurosport will cover selected stages of the race whereas the full racing distance can be watched on audi-liveracing.com on the internet. - Will Duval/Kristensen/McNish be able to extend their lead of the standings? - How well will the World Champions Fässler/Lotterer/Tréluyer fare? - How will the battle with Toyota develop? - Which manufacturer will travel to Le Mans with a points advantage? Dr. Wolfgang Ullrich, Head of Audi Motorsport: ""As always, Audi will be using the race at Spa as a 'dress rehearsal' for the Le Mans 24 Hours in June. Spa is a race track with a character that's completely different from Silverstone. We thoroughly reviewed the first race of the season and accomplished our tasks in order to be well prepared for the second round of the WEC. Fielding the Le Mans aero variant on the third vehicle that hasn't been optimized for the lap times at Spa is an important element of the preparation for the 24-hour race."" Ralf Jüttner, Technical Director Audi Sport Team Joest: ""The comparison with our competitor will start from scratch again at Spa. We can expect our opponent Toyota to compete with the latest technological update. For the first time this year, we'll be running with three cars. That means more work for our team. Spa's a great track and a race that definitely belongs on the WEC calendar. The new Audi R18 e-tron quattro was immediately reliable and fast."" Facts and quotes by the Audi drivers Marcel Fässler (36/CH), Audi R18 e-tron quattro #1 (Audi Sport Team Joest) - Drove the fastest race lap at Spa a year ago - Had to admit defeat at Silverstone by only 3.4 seconds ""Spa's one of my favorite tracks. In the LMP sports car, the circuit is a fantastic challenge. Eau Rouge, Blanchimont and the fast downhill double left-hand turn are particularly nice. Plus I like the ambience in Belgium extremely well."" André Lotterer (31/D), Audi R18 e-tron quattro #1 (Audi Sport Team Joest) - Regards Spa as his 'home' track - Is the runner-up in the standings after the 2013 season opener ""I grew up in Belgium and went to the track as a child. That's why Spa is always special for me. It's a fast track that should be suiting our car well. My two team-mates really enjoy driving there too. I'm hoping for us to be able to reverse the order of the top two results of the Silverstone weekend."" Benoît Tréluyer (36/F), Audi R18 e-tron quattro #1 (Audi Sport Team Joest) - Winner of the 2013 Sebring 12 Hours - The World Champion was the runner-up in Belgium last year ""For my team-mate André Lotterer, Spa is a 'home' track in a way. We'll be running for the first time now in this year's R18 e-tron quattro and the new tires on this track.

Loïc Duval (30/F), Audi R18 e-tron quattro #2 (Audi Sport Team Joest) - Won the Spa 6 Hours in the Audi R18 ultra last year - Leads the standings with his team-mate after the success at Silverstone ""I achieved my first victory with Audi at Spa last year. In May, the weather in the Ardennes is often unstable. Together with Allan and Tom I'd like to repeat the success at Silverstone and extend our World Championship lead."" Tom Kristensen (45/DK), Audi R18 e-tron quattro #2 (Audi Sport Team Joest) - The Dane achieved his first victory of the season at Silverstone - Ten years ago, he won at Spa in the Audi R8 ""Spa for us drivers, the cars and the teams is a huge challenge. It's a typical track from a different era with many vertical differences and corresponding compressions, with blind turns and frequently changing weather. The mechanics and all the other team members did an outstanding job at Silverstone. The pit stops and strategy were good. Spa's our last preparation in racing conditions before the biggest competition of the year at Le Mans."" Allan McNish (43/GB), Audi R18 e-tron quattro #2 (Audi Sport Team Joest) - Achieved the fastest time in qualifying at Spa last year - At the WEC opener in England, celebrated his first victory in an R18 e-tron quattro ""I always enjoy driving again at Spa. The track follows the topography in an ideal way. That's a hallmark of many good circuits. Some of the world's nicest corners are found at Spa, such as Eau Rouge or Pouhon. The races there are always thrilling, partially due to the weather but also because there are always surprises. The track is rough on the drivers, the car and the tires. In addition, we're expecting the competition at Spa to be tough due to Toyota. We drivers and our engineers have found a very good rhythm of working together."" Marc Gené (39/E), Audi R18 e-tron quattro #3 (Audi Sport Team Joest) - Won the race at Spa on making his Audi debut a year ago - Has celebrated three sports car victories at Spa since 2008 ""I'm looking forward to one of my favorite tracks that I've won at three times before. For us, it's the big preparation for Le Mans. The weather's often unpredictable. For Oliver Jarvis, Lucas di Grassi and me, it's the only opportunity to adjust to each other in racing conditions. Until now, I've only driven the Audi R18 e-tron quattro in tests. I'd like to repeat last year's victory."" Lucas di Grassi (28/BR), Audi R18 e-tron quattro #3 (Audi Sport Team Joest) - Is starting his third sports car race with Audi - Was the runner-up in the Sebring 12 Hours in March ""I'm experiencing my first WEC race in 2013 at Spa. I've got fond memories of this legendary circuit from GP2 and Formula 1. There's no nicer track if you're running in a fast car. I'll be starting with two different team-mates than I did at Sebring. We'll be able to gear up now for the biggest task of the year in racing conditions."" Oliver Jarvis (29/GB), Audi R18 e-tron quattro #3 (Audi Sport Team Joest) - Celebrated a class victory with Audi at Daytona in January - Won the Sebring 12 Hours in March ""My sports car career in Audi's factory team began a year ago at Spa. We immediately took a podium. It's a great feeling to return now. After a good race at Sebring I'm traveling to Spa even better prepared than I was twelve months ago. For the first time, I'm running with my two new team-mates. And we're developing the car with special aerodynamics for Le Mans. That'll be our personal warm-up for the 24-hour race.""

There's no other place where you can feel the centrifugal forces within your body as much as you can in Eau Rouge. Spa is the second-longest track after Le Mans and the weather is always changeable in the Ardennes. Eau Rouge remains the greatest single challenge. In Formula 1, due to the smaller engines and lower weight, you run flat-out there but in the heavier sports car Eau Rouge is even more extreme. Good overtaking opportunities exist in La Source, in front of Les Combes, in the double left-hand turn, on the Fagnes passage and in the chicane before the start and finish. The tarmac provides outstanding grip which is why slicks even work well when the track is slightly damp. In 2012, I celebrated my third sports car victory on this track with my team-mates.""

Not quite there, but still cool. Also, from the speculation last year, I got the feeling the top speed at Le Mans was due to the hybrid motors on the front axle bogging them down a bit at absolute top speed with extra mechanical drag? As I admit, that was speculation though. Maybe aero really was the limiting factor. Yesterday at 9:48 PM Report abuse Permalink Vorsprung durch Tecknik.

"Oct 12 2009 	An average hotel that gets everything done well	I was in Beijing recently for business and i gotta saythat i was very pleased with the folks at Days Inn Joiest, Beijing. Although there was a lack of communication (i don't speak mandarin, they speak very little english) they tried their very best to help and accommodate us. Jan 20 2009 	A Complete Disappointment	To start I would never stay in this hotel again!Our tour agency guaranteed us that this was a four-star hotel and that was the furthest from the truth! Upon entering you had to endure the reeking smell of smoke. Interestingly enough there were no smoking signs plastered all over the place, but the waitress was kind enough to provide people with ashtrays. The overall quality of the hotel was very poor and not newly renovated like stated by our tour guide. Once in our room, we were greeted with peeling wallpaper, hair and dirt on the floor, a corroded faucet, and a nasty, small shower. The room was really small and very unclean. We were on a tour with three other people and they all had problems with their rooms. They were dirty, the heat didn't work in one room, and others smelled of smoke. When we complained, we were offered other rooms. They were slightly larger, but the same quality. There was even a hole in the bedspread in our &quot;better&quot; room.The only redeeming factor about this hotel was that the hotel staff was nice. They weren't always that helpful, but at least they were polite. Overall, I would never stay at this hotel again. It totally ruined our trip! Sep 24 2008 	Horrible reeked of cigarette smoke	Our tour accidently booked us in this hotel instead of the Days Inn Hotel and Suites on Hua Wei. On first entering the hotel, I was overwelmed with the smell of cigarette smoke. The lobby was drab and dirty. We were forced to spend one night here. We asked for a non smoking room and the desk person said we did have a non smoking room, but the room had an ash tray. The ventalation system was horrible and all night long we were stifled with cigarette smoke from other rooms. We opened the window. However, all night long metal workers were loading trucks under our window. We hardly slept at all. We were miserable. The staff was barely helpful when an alarm kept going off when we closed our door. Would never reccomend this hotel. Jul 25 2008 	Disgusting	My husband and I paid too much money to stay at this supposed 4 star hotel. It is a sub-par 2 star and that is only because they have a lobby and a door man. When I am done writing this review, I am going to give an earful to our 'travel agent'.The hotel is filthy. We stayed on the third floor and all of the carpets in the hall are stained badly, maybe from serious water damage. We decided to take the stairs to the morning buffet on the fourth floor and what a shock: years /decades of dirt and dust, piles of old furniture and garbage, not to mention the stairs were never finished and were just creaking wood and bare dirty cement walls.Our bathroom was never cleaned properly. Each day we'd return to our room to see gross stranger's hair and debris behind the bathroom door. We asked for our shower drain to be cleaned and it never was. Every shower we took the shower overflowed (no bathtub).Please don't stay here. I'm sure you can find much better accommodation elsewhere for a decent price. May 29 2008	hallway insufficient lightings and not enough ventilation; non english speaking	i and my family stayed here for 3 consecutive nights. it was our very first visit to beijing last april 2008. first thing i noticed when we first checked in was there werent enough staffs in the lobby. didnt see any bell boys to assist with our baggages. hallways were very dark as lightings were very insufficient. and not much ventilation too. cant expect too much since this was an inn and not a hotel. hope management can make improvements especially 2008 olympic is 2 months away. Apr 22 2008 	I will go again!	I booked this hotel while staying in the &quot;Super 8 GuoMao&quot;, it was a good change. The hotel is pretty new, about 2 years old. Rooms are clean and modern. Reception staff spoke English reasonably well and were friendly and helpful. For this hotel you get a good discount if you buy their VIP card first. The booked single room was perfectly ok (in theory), but a little small, so I settled on a &quot;Queen&quot;. I was given a room really far away from the lift on the 3/F. Everything was perfect, but then at about am5:00 some machine noise started from above.Next night I was given another room, near the lift. No machine noise, but you have people walking by talking loudly all night. Next time I would probably take more time to choose a room.Pro:Nice buildingNice rooms, modern and clean, nice bathrooms tooGreat buffet breakfastNear subway (10 Minutes to CiQiKou Station, Line 5)Friendly staffClose to shopping area (ChongWenMen DaJie)Tiananmen and Wangfujing in (long, but less 1 hour) walk distanceCon:Some rooms may have machine noise problems (from the conference center above??)It's in a rather newly build commercial area with little typical Beijing restaurant options.It should also be noted that there are several bus lines in front of the hotel. All east going buses will bring you to CiQiKou subway, avoiding the 10 Minutes walk. Bus 23 brings you right in front of GuoMao Carrefour supermarket. Will stay definitely again next time. Dec 19 2007 	Loved Beijing	We found this hotel excellent, clean efficient, everything you could ask for in a Hotel Oct 2 2007 	Just getting started?	Hotel was relatively new when I was there (I think). There was some construction in and around the hotel. The facilities were great and clean. Prices were relatively cheap and the location was pretty good, however customer service was pretty awful.Food was good. Buffet had Hagen Daaz ice cream (served by an attendent... I guess his time was worth less than the ice cream). Wine and beer included (all you can drink).When we were checking out, they couldn't find a laundry bag and tried to charge us for it. We had some laundry done and they forgot to return the bag. They asked us to OPEN UP OUR LUGGAGE while they inspected for the bag. Personally, I think this is unacceptable. Sep 17 2007 	good for price	We stayed at days inn in August 07 for 3 nights. We booked through the hotels website which seemed to be the cheapest rate. The only problem we had was that we had booked a non - smoking room and they put us in a smoking room. When we asked to be moved they did so although their idea of a non smoking room was to remove the ashtray! Make sure when booking in at reception to state clearly what type of room you want.The staff were very helpful even though it was difficult at times as not many spoke much english. Rooms/hotel were clean and tidy. The breakfast was buffet style with plenty of choice.Overall valve for money was good, the only slight down side was that there were not many restaurants nearby and it was a 15 - 20 minutes walk to main sites. Jul 16 2007	Just consider this......	First of all, even tho Expedia sent us a confirmation # and an itinerary number, when we reached the hotel they had no record of our reservation. We just returned home and we tried to speak to someone at Expedia and got an operator in the Philippines after 15 minutes on hold and a disconnect; then another 15 minutes on hold to be told, &quot;we'll bring it up at our next meeting.&quot; Oh, yeah. Anyway.....As for the hotel..... As they say, &quot;location, location, location&quot;. This hotel looks nice and is quite modern. Love the clean white duvet covering on the silk comforter, the flat screen TV on the wall - even tho the CNN connection was very sporatic and BBC had picture and no sound, the shower had lots of hot water tho the glass enclosure had some sort of leak and it made the bathroom floor all wet. The funny thing about the place was that it didn't feel Chinese even a little bit. If you woke up in the room you could have been in Tucson!! As for the location, it isn't near much. Not even an underground station. It is on a busy business street so at night it is pretty desolate and not conducive to walking anywhere. You have to catch a cab to go any place and the Beijing cabbies have become very selective on where they are willing to take you. We were refused rides 4 out of 5 times we hailed one. This was our 3rd trip to Bejing and things have changed. I guess it was partially our fault because the hotel looks like a business hotel and we should have known better. Tho the description of the location being 1 km from the Forbidden City is a bit of a stretch. The congestion in the center of Beijing is unbelievable! Going to an appt. less than 5 miles away took us over 1:45 minutes and that included a cab, then running, then another cab then walking the balance of the way. Next time we'll select a hotel in a more walkable area or at least near an underground station. Each night we felt like we were captive in the hotel - no where to walk or too much trouble to try and find a cab.You decide. Apr 6 2007 	Great Hotel!	We (a group of 173 people/teenagers from America) have just returned from a 5 day stay at the Joiest Days Inn In Beijing and had an incredibly wonderful time! The staff was very friendly and helpful with answering any questions and exchanging everyones money. The rooms were very nice and spacious for a single or double occupancy. All rooms have flat screen HD TVs and a handful of English speaking channels (including HBO). The bathrooms were nice with the exception of the glass divider between the bathroom and the main room....you could see the person in the shower pretty well! The rooms were always cleaned and fresh towels were provided every day. There's even a little Mini-Golf course on the 2nd floor. The breakfast buffet was to die for!! They had everything and anything a tourist could want! Overall, this is one of the BEST hotels in Beijing China! Thank you. Dec 28 2006 	A Satisfied Stay	Our group of 14 relatives have just returned from Beijing Nanshan Ski Tour. We stayed 3 nights at this hotel in downtown Beijing and found the rooms fully to our satisfaction. However luggage delivery to our rooms were a little slow. Moreover on the last day, hotel staff forgot to pickup luggage from outside our rooms as pre-arranged. Apr 22 2006	Great Value for Money Hotel	Stayed at the Days Inn Joiest Hotel reluctantly at first since I could not find any reviews at all. But my travel agent insisted it's a nice hotel, newly opened and at a very good rate for budget travellers. I found the hotel to be a good one for its price. The lobby is quite similar to a hospital lobby though but the rooms are spacious and comes with new gadgets including a plasma tv in all the rooms and the bathroom gadgets are all new including a massage3 shower and a hand held shower. The buffet breakfast at the 4th floor has a wide variety of western, Chinese and Japanese foods. The staff here at the restaurant and even at the reception has very limited knowledge of the English language like any other budget hotels in China."
"Top notch Western Hotel in China	We recently spent four nights at this hotel and were impressed by several things. First, the rooms are definitely 5-star and well maintained. Second the complimentary breakfast was the most broad selection of menu choices we'd ever experienced. Both hot and cold menu options, both western and traditional Chinese breakfast fare. Service by concierge and bell staff was excellent. We would highly recommend for a westerner who wants the comforts of home in the midst of China. Nov 26 2009 	Superb stay!	Even though we arrived at the hotel long before check in time, we were taken to our room straight away. From the moment we first entered the hotel until our departure nine days later, all of the staff were fantastic. All very courteous. True service with a smile. They made us feel very welcome.Our room was situated on the 11th floor. A very stylish and comfy double room. Sui Yuan restaurant on the 3rd floor is worth a visit, especially for the peking duck with pancakes. It was to die for and at such a good price (8 GBP for a whole duck!). We were with three people and had a lot of duck left, because it was huge.The waitress was very pro active and offered to have two other dishes made of the duck. They were also excellent.Drinks at the bar on the ground floor are nice after a long day of sightseeing (they do a good Singapore sling).I don't fully agree with some of the other reviewers about the location of the hotel being a minus. As Beijing is a massive city, getting around basically takes time from any part in town. It doesn't really matter where you are, in rush hour ( 7-9 am and 5-7 pm) any ride will take long. Other than this, none of the temples and places of interest are in one part of town anyway. So no matter where you are in between the 1st and 2nd ring road, you'll have to travel! I thought this was quite pleasant too. Taxis are cheap and with traveling around the different areas you get to see a lot. Ask the concierge to write down the places you want to visit on a card in Chinese. This definitely saves a lot of heartache as a lot of taxi drivers don't speak English.Xi'dan area is a very trendy area with lots of big shopping malls and bars/restaurants. This area is approx 5 minutes by taxi from the hotel. At night this is a popular hang out for Chinese youngsters. Worth a visit at night.The Park Hyatt is a must for a meal on the 66th floor at China Grill or a drink in the bar on the 65th floor. The food is a real treat and the view is out of this world! All in all we had a superb stay at the Doubletree Hilton Beijing and would absolutely go again. Nov 17 2009 	Comfortable	Fantastic hotel that is managed by Hilton . Excellent breakfast ( I shared some pictures ).Kind and excellent staff . The pool water was cold in Autumn !! No body couldn't swim in that.Comfortable rooms and beds ( Really good beds ).Wireless internet in lobby.There is a big supermarket and a good CONFECTIONERY near hotel . Finding Muslim foods near the hotel is a hassle but you can buy vegetable pizza from Pappa Jonse restaurant. The nearest Subway station is not close to the hotel but you can walk to there and it takes about half an hour(ChangChun Jie station) or take a taxi to there. You can travel with 2 RMB to any station like Beijing Zoo.( There is a fantastic and cheap shopping center in front of Beijing zoo ( on top of Bus stations ) )I recommend Hilton hotels in Beijing to my friends.Sincerely Nov 2 2009 	very pleased very nice 5 stars	i booked 3 nights with my hilton points, was given a very nice 1 bedroom suite with acces to executive lounge, free great breakfast, evening hors d'oeuvres, drinks and wireless internet,i love it so now im staying 2 more nights in the same suite for less than 100$ with taxes, special deal at the front desk.im not pleased with internet 100 yuan, 15$ and location...10 mins taxi from nearest subway and it is very hard to get a taxi around subway stations or in the streets and had to wait up to 30 mins each time...very fustration in long winter months.everybody is very very nice and professional, i will come back for sure if i get the same deal, less then 100$ for 1 bedroom suite with acces to executive lounge. Oct 24 2009 	Excellent Management	Upon arriving to this hotel, the room accomodations were not up to proper standards. Though the hotel was booked, the on-duty manager, Kenny, went far above and beyond the call of duty and not only fixed the problem, but did so with great professionalism, proficiency, and attentiveness. I and my colleagues are now very pleased with Kenny's efforts and the response of his staff, and we would highly recommend this hotel to other travelers. Oct 19 2009 	Amazing service and awesome staff	I must say that they have a fantastic team! Very helpful, friendly, a true service with a smile and professional (from Concierge to Front Office, Restaurant, Room Service and Housekeeping). Not a single complaint from me and my friend. This being my first trip to Beijing, I was clueless...Ray and the rest of his concierge team assist us with travel tips and transportation arrangement. Staying in Doubletree by Hilton Beijing felt like a home away from home. Oct 12 2009 	Everything's good except for the location	I booked this hotel via Expedia during their 2-for-1 promo. This hotel is quite new, probably built just in time for the Olympics last year. All in all, this hotel is grand and beautiful. The exterior and the interior are both very western and modern. Rooms are on the small side, judged by US standards, but very functional. By the way, loved the long sectional sofa/coach/chaise along the floor-to-ceiling window. The amenities are adequate of the Hilton standard. Restaurants serve good breakfast buffet and decent meals. Tip: there is another breakfast buffet location up on the business floors, if you want to escape the hectic crowd in the main hall - but choices of food items are limited at this location. All in all, quite satisfied with the services and the price I paid. One thing - although this hotel is located just outside the 2nd Ring Road on a main avenue, it is actually not close to any major sites or a subway station. Sometimes, taxis are hard to find. And often, you end up sitting in the traffic for a long time to get somewhere. Oct 9 2009 	5 star luxury at a 3 star price	As its a relatively new hotel, all facilities are fresh and new. A grand entrance hall awaits you where your bags are taken to your room after check in. All staff were particularly friendly and welcoming. On the ground floor there is a sublime warm and cozy bar, adjacent to the restaurant / breakfast room. The rooms are modern and spacious, with the finest decor and facilities. The hotel also features a 3rd floor outdoor roof garden, swimming pool and health spa. A 4 star rating doesnt really do it enough justice. Sep 9 2009	nothing was too much trouble - friendly clean and beautiful	Lovely hotel with beautiful rooms. Staff friendly and helpful - nothing was too much trouble. Breakfast wonderful, as there was a large Chinese food counter and also a well stocked Western breakfast counter. Noticing that I was breakfasting alone, a friendly girl attendant brought me a newspaper to read and that was typical of the kind of service you got there. The air-con control was difficult to work out but when I phoned reception, someone came within a few minutes and sorted it with a smile..The fitness suite and pool were spotlessly clean, attractive and fresh.The hotel reception coped admirably and were not fazed by the arrival of 140 of us - even giving us padlocks for our luggage when we left for an overnight train journey.It's not central but the location is pleasant and - yes - taxis are cheap. Aug 17 2009 	Book an Executive Floor Room and enjoy the view and SUPERB services t the Executive Lounge.	Excellent services from Front Desk, Concierge, Car Attendants, Executive Lounge staffs are SUPERB...Nearby Subway Station is just a Taxi ride away (about 10-15 CNY)! Aug 2 2009 	I enjoyed being there!	Excellent Breakfast, Charming personnel, Real Exchange Rate with no extra fees but not more than US $ 300! Jul 18 2009 	Very good service and hotel decoration	This is the best hotel in Xuan Wu District, Beijing. Hotel is very new and staff is very warm and friendly. Wonderful faclities, swimming pool on the rooftop garden very good feeling after a hard day work. I will definite come back to this hotel on my next trip. Jul 12 2009 	Doubletree-Beijing - Great Room Front Desk Conceirge and Service	My wife and I recently took our 13 year old Grandson to Beijing. We booked early with the Doubletree and worked via phone and email with their Conceirge team to help plan our stay. They were terrific. They arranged guide services, tours, and evening events before our arrival. When asked, they made adjustments to the plans and were simply a joy to work with. And the breakfast buffets had Grandson Will's eyes popping. The food was terrific, interesting, and plentiful. The service crew was also very good. Our 2 bedroom suite was spacious and very comfortable.We really did get 5-Star treatment throughout our stay. Thanks Doubletree-Beijing!! Jul 7 2009 	Great Hotel helpful staff but ......	We stayed at the Doubletree for 4 nights on the last leg of our trip to HK and China. It is a great hotel, very modern and our room was excellent; it is quite quirky to have the glass wall in the bathroom, as can be seen from the photos posted by other members. The breakfasts were everything you would expect from a hotel of this class and we also enjoyed the meals we had in the restaurant, which we also thought were very reasonably priced. There was nothing actually that we could find fault with about the hotel, ..... apart from it's location. For us, it was a little too far from the centre of Beijing. Because of the location we were the first 'pick up' for our tours (usually at 7.00am) and then the coach would spend up to 2 hours picking up from other hotels. At the end of each day we were the last couple to get dropped off - normally around 6.00pm. No criticism here, and each tour was completely fantastic, but it did mean that we really felt that we couldn't face travelling back into the centre of the city at night. It sometimes felt like quite an ordeal facing the very heavy traffic. This was the only small complaint that we had and this is the only reason that I wouldn't recommend the hotel to a friend. We organised a tour of the Hutongs through the concierge and our guide for this was delightful and I'd like to recommend her to anyone out there planning to visit Beijing. Her name is Skye and she would be happy to arrange tours to the Hutongs, the Forbidden City, the Great Wall, Temple of Heaven etc etc. If anyone wants an excellent guide, or any tours organised, in Beijing, feel free to contact me and I will let you have her email address. Jul 5 2009 	Good service Comfortable room Nice rooftop garden	I've been this Doubletree for 5 days, which located in long historical district of downtown Beijing, It has friendly service, good restaurants, comfortable rooms, so many wonderful art works, and especially a pretty good rooftop garden including an in-door swimming pool near the seperate spa rooms and gym. That's totally an unforgetable experience in Beijing. Jun 28 2009 	Terrible location 	We stayed at the Doubletree for 5 nights while visiting Beijing. The hotel turned out to be a disappointment. Its location is not near any of the major Beijing attractions. There are bus stops near by but with the heavy traffic congestion in Beijing, it takes about an hour by car to get to Tiananmen Square, Forbidden City, Temple of Heaven or Olympic Village. Metro is the best bid but metro stop is not near by. You'll have to take a taxi or bus to get to the metro stop. Beijing Taxi is just like in NY City or any other major city, you better have a idea of the distance and cost. The Concierge desk is just too busy trying to get us to go on a package tour every time we ask for directions. We asked for a City map at the concierge but this hotel had no map what so ever. We were given a faded copy of metro map in black &amp; white. We asked for directions to Mutianyu Great Wall and was told that there were only two ways to get there 1. Join a tour for $320 Chinese yuan (about $50 US) per person or 2. Hire a Hotel car for $600 Yuan (about $95 US). I found out from the Information Desk at the Forbidden City to take the dedicated Bus line #6 to Mutianyu Great Wall for $50 yuan (about $8 US) round trip. Another disappointment, our room was not serviced after the first night. We got back to the room at 10 pm to find the room not cleaned or made up. We were just too tire to be bothered. I told the front desk next morning and thereafter was fine but no wash cloth. The swimming pool was not open during our stay.There is restaurant onsite but pricy. You can go to the restaurants across the street for a great meal for 1/3 of the cost. Don't be afraid to mingle with the locals, we found great food and value than the hotel would tell us. The room rate does not include breakfast or internet access. There is additional $120 yuan (about $20 US) for 24 hours internet connection which is very high. Overall, the hotel is new, the room size is same as that of a typical hotel in the US, quiet and comfortable. The location is not desirable, not convenient or near any attractions. The concierge service is poor and hard to get any information. We had great time in Beijing with many thanks from tips provided by locals and City Information Office. May 30 2009 	Great hotel - excellent rooms - real value for money	The Doubletree was opened for the Olympic Games in Beijing in 2008. Accordingly everything is still very new. Rooms are very spacious and extremly clean. And though the guests are mainly from Asian countries the breakfast buffet is great also for European travellers seeking an Continental Breakfast. Access by public transport is fine. Though a little bit remote, the next subway station is a 5-10 min. 15-20 CYN ride away. Close to the hotel you find a number of authentic low budget Chinese restaurants, if you don't want to eat in the hotel. I can fully recommend the Doubletree Beijing both for Business and Sightseeing in Beijing. May 22 2009 	Clean oasis in Beijing	It was a pleasure to come back to this hotel each evening. I stayed for three nights.The room was clean, modern and very comfortable. The service for breakfast was outstanding. The front desk staff were also excellent. The only minus was that you could hear some traffic through the windows. I would stay here again. May 18 2009 	Has potential	We stayed here for three nights as part of our 15 days customized china tour. It's fairly new so the rooms were clean and the decor very modern--there were some issues with my parent's bathroom door with the knobs falling apart and the toilet in our room not flushing well, but they fixed it quickly the next day. the heater doesn't work during spring time so had to turn off the central cooling system. the rooms were quiet--as they recently completed all construction. one complaint that I have is the service--but the service sector seems to be a problem throughout China as it lags desparately behind its economic growth (which is a pity as it makes China a very unattractive place for future visits). For a self-proclaimed five star hotel, the people at the check-in counter do not smile or greet their guests as they should -- I was standing at the counter for over five minutes waiting to change money, right in front of the lady receptionist who was looking down at whatever she was doing -- I was waiting for her to look up and say hello but she never did, so I had to speak up first and say &quot;excuse me, can you help me change money please&quot;? She then replied, &quot;okay, wait-a-minute please&quot;--like I wasn't waiting for SEVERAL Minutes already!.....I casually mentioned this to my tour guide however, and she reported this to her boss who called the hotel--the next day, I received a personal apology from the assistant manager who also provided fruits for us in our rooms. The man at the concierge was not very helpful either--he too never looked at us while he was talking and was very inpatient. My husband had broken his camera lens and we needed to find a replacement, but all he was able to do was point across the street and said to wait for the morning to go there. My husband went that night and saw absolutely no electronic stores, it was just a mall full of department stores! We went the next morning to ask another guy and at least he was smart enough to look through the internet for a place, although it was 2 hours away from the hotel. well, good thing our tour guide new of a cheap electronic center just FIVE minutes away from the hotel! Most of the workers (especially waiters) did not speak any English at all which made communication difficult (this is not expected for a &quot;hilton&quot; hotel). Overall, nice comfortable rooms but service can be variable depending on who you get stuck with--definitely room for improvement. Of note though, we did call 3 weeks after our stay to see if they can help us contact our tour guide, and a lady by the name of Louisa was very diligent in helping us acquire that number. One last thing, hotel is far from city center and traffic from one place to another is HORRIBLE! Apr 12 2009 	Chic and very modern with excellent staff	I stayed here with my wife, mother and sister-in-law for 3 nights. Overall, we were very impressed with how helpful everyone was and the overall layout and design of the hotel.Location: If you are wanting to sight-see, this hotel is somewhat out of the way of that. It is in the south-west of the city. We took the #7 bus to the subway, which took about 15 minutes. The subway is not within walking distance. The only two monuments that I could walk to where not that impressive.The staff speak excellent English and are very helpful. We booked the great wall tour through them. It is 400RMB/person for an all day tour as well as the Ming Tombs as your first stop. Our guide (Lu Lu) was great! Her english was excellent and she was very knowledgeable. They picked us up at 7am and we got back around 6 or 7. However, be forewarned that they also stop at a traditional chinese medicine place where you can pay 20RMB for a 10 minute foot massage and receive a quick pulse and tongue examination and diagnosis. The price is good, so we did it.  The doctor was actually pretty impressive as just by feeling my wife's pulse, he could tell that she had sinus problems. They of course then recommend some herbal treatment, which is kind of pricey. Being as we live in Changsha, Hunan as teachers, we will check out the prices here.The hotel was very modern and chic. Our guest room did not have a tub, but the shower was great. A nice overhead shower head with great water pressure. The 21st executive lounge is nice for relaxing and if you are an honors member, you can also check in there if you arrive while a huge tour group is downstairs in the lobby.The breakfast is nice.The coffee lounge was nice too. 40RMB or so for a mocha and/or latte/ cappicino, but the cups are large and it was very good.The Miso soup was excellent.The location is quiet, but as I said, you are a little ways away from both restaurants and sights. With the side that we were on, we bordered an executive building, so we could see right into their office, and I'm sure vice-versa. :) Apr 10 2009 	Great hotel friendly and helpful staff	Although on the west side of Beijing, the hotel was perfect for our three day visit. The hotel staff was extremely friendly and accomodating. The room was large and well maintained. The food in the two restaurants within the hotel was outstanding.Overall a great stay. Jan 23 2009 	Doubletree by Hilton Beijing	I was in many Hilton Hotels around the world but this is so so no good no bad. This hotel still under construction, 80% of this hotel is empty like the other hotels in Beijing. The ubication is far far away from the center and principal atractions, spend 50 yuans round trip and the traffic is terrible, worse than in New York or the 395 in Washington DC, busy busy traffic all day....i was in the suite for 10 days and was too noisy and cold, the quality of this hotel is not the best u can feel the cold and the noise of the traffic through the window there are an open window between the windows and that is why the room is cold and u feel the wind.Because of this problem my girlfriend get a flu for the next week really bad-well no the chicken flu eh!!-The hotel is nice looks like a 5 stars hotel have huge cold areas and the employees walking around like in Siberia.The restaurant is nice good food, good service, People speak english, tours in cash -bad-For the price i recomend another hotel in the center if u make numbers plus the taxi and tips and the time i recomend other hotel there are more than 2000 new hotels in Beijing and today for the crisis are empty...and the best are cheap, This hotel is good for business no for honey moon only for stay 3 days or less nothing around and most of the taxis dont know where is this hotel.Beware with the price looks cheap but the charges are so expensive.The happy hour is good, but i think the best is in the Hilton Bangkok.After this hotel we move to a new hotel in the center close to the New Trade Center Mall and was the best choice cheap warm and close to everything and the taxi only 10 yuans. Jan 6 2009 	Fantastic Hotel	I am a seasoned traveller. I stayed for 3 nights at this hotel with my daughter and wife. The hotel was new and I loved the decor. I have stayed in many hotels (some that were technically in a &quot;better&quot; class). However, this hotel gave me the best experience/feeling ever. The combination of a nice new hotel with the friendliest, most helpful staff I have ever come across made this stay memorable. I will all travellers to Beijing could experience this hotel. No, it is not the most central hotel. However, taxies are inexpensive. Bring a card from the hotel with the address and give it to the cab driver. This brought us directly to the hotel every time. I suggest brining a map from the hotel also. This seemed to work well. I would LOVE to go back to this hotel.My sentiments are shared by wife and 8 year old daughter. Nov 26 2008 	New Hotel but Far From CBD	New hotel. Service was nice and friendly. Excellent 5 star hotel. Only downside, as a prior reviewer mentioned, is that taxis don't know where the hotel is. They frequently take you to the Hilton instead of the Doubletree. This problem will resolve itself though as taxi drivers become more familiar with the hotel.The hotel itself is about half an hour from the Haidian district by taxi and in a residential district. There is a local shopping mall about a block away with a Pizza Hut, McDonalds, Yoshinoya (Japanese fast food chain featuring beef over rice), Xiabu Xiabu (Chinese hot pot chain), a supermarket and other stores. Also, a KTV nearby if you're up for it. Nov 7 2008 	Customer Service is second to none at Doubletree	My partner and I have just come back from a weeks holiday in Beijing. we stayed at the Doubletree. The hotel is very new and only opened 2 months ago, so everything is very clean, new and shiny. The rooms are very comfortable and quite spacious and you have a choice of a rainshower or power shower in the bathroom. The hotel is not centrally located within walking distance to Tianamen Square or the Forbidden City and shopping district Wangfujing like all the other 5 star western hotels but you would pay almost double for the same quality and comfort. It is very easy to get a taxi to the centre only 10 mins and costs around £1-2 pounds which is nothing. There are also buses just outside the hotel which will take you to the centre for the princely cost of 10p (1 yuan).The conceirge service is fantastic. They were very friendly and helpful and catered to our every need, from arranging our private tour and negotiating us a good price to running around the streets trying to find us a taxi during rush hour.There's an outdor pool which was closed as it was winter time and a very nice gym and spa, which makes a difference from the usual pokey hotel gyms and spa areas.Everyone in the hotel made you feel very welcome and I would certainly stay at the double again if I ever went back to Beijing! Aug 31 2008 	Loved the Doubletree	New Hotel. completed July 2008.We stayed there for the Olympics and had a wonderful experience.The staff were all very friendly and could not do enough for us.Meals in the all day restaurant were buffet style or al a carte and very good choices.The rooms were excellent, spaceous light and airy , Bathrooms modern light and very clean.Rooftop pool and gardenAlthough not in the centre of Beijing there are always taxis outside the hotel and they are very cheap, takes about 10 mins to the centre.Only drawback is taxis keep taking you back to the wrong Hilton, this may be because it is so new, hopefully the Hilton Group will sort this problem. Oct 9 2009 	Nice and kindly"
"Aug 13 2009	Great hotel	Stayed here as part of a Jules Verne tour of China. Of all the hotels we stayed in this was our favourite. Very elegant hotel with huge rooms. Beds large and very comfortable. There was free internet access in the rooms. The restaurant buffet was excellent and catered for all tastes . It was very good value with dinner for around £8 , breakfast also great with lots of Asian dishes along with the usual bacon eggs etc. Dec 23 2008 	Very nice stay	The hotel stay was very good, breakfast was plentiful and had anything you could desire.Pros: * Hotel facilities * Room size * Breakfast * LocationShortcomings: * Internet access in the room doesn't come cheap and is wired (not wireless) Aug 19 2008 	Empark - Very Comfortable Amenities	I stayed at the Empark for the entire month of August while I was working at the Olympics. Upon arriving and through the entire stay, the staff was very attentive to my needs. The only issues I have is that the beds are extremely hard, free wireless is only available in the lobby - wired service is available in your room for a reasonable fee (hourly or by day) and laundry (which is done next door) is extremely expensive. Being in China I expected laundry service to be a lot cheaper than western hotels. In the basement of the hotel (floor B2) is a vegas-like mall. Restaurants, small boutiques, spas &amp; a gym/pool that is free for VIP guests of the hotel. I swam a few times at the pool and worked out at the gym. Although the hotel claims the gym is open 24hrs, it isn't staffed round the clock and it often appears closed. The Golden Resources Cafeteria in the hotel is a decent restaurant that offers a buffet for breakfast and dinner. My stay included breakfast and I was never disappointed. They offer a good selection of cereals, juices and fruits, as well as an assortment of hot entrees, breads &amp; sweet rolls. The coffee is good too! Taxis are fairly easy to come by at the hotel but keep in mind the hotel is located in the northwest part of the city and many of the historical attractions and shopping (Pearl &amp; Silk Market) are on the southeast part of town - expect a long cab ride. Fortunately taxi fares are inexpensive here.If you're coming to town for sightseeing, I think you would find this hotel too far out of the way (Summer Palace is the closest attraction). Aug 26 2007 	Great hotel...problematic communication	I stayed in Empark Grand Hotel for 4 nights (13-18/08), as I was participating in a conference held in the hotel.It was my first time staying in a 5 star hotel, so I was enthusiastic about the room and the hotel as a whole.It was very clean, quite impressive and well decorated. The food in the hotel's restaurant (lunch and breakfast) can be characterized as full. It had vegetarian menus, and seafood amongst others.The only problem I had was the communication part of my staying. The problem was that I was Greek, the reception manager was Chinese and we tryied to communicate in English, so we had to give much more effort than usual.In my lasta night there, I found out that there was a whole city underneath the hotel, but I didn't have time and courage to visit it.As a general, my staying there can be characterized as very pleasant. VagelisAthens, Greece Jul 18 2005	Perfectly Good Hotel	Stayed here for five nights in the spring. A very comfortable hotel with all the amenities I needed. Helpful staff who speak good English. For about $100 per night US (including breakfast, which was satisfactory but not great), it's a very good deal. I guess there's a whole underground 'city' somewhere on the grounds, but I never got around to it. The rooms are quiet, comfortable, well-appointed, and if you're used to a 3-to-4 star place in the states, it will suit you fine. The beds are HARD AS A ROCK, but I found that to be the case everywhere else I went in China, too. Seems that's just how they do beds over there.The location could be a problem for some. It is in the Northwest of the city, not in a walkable part of town. A taxi to the city center (Tiananmen Square area) takes about 20-30 minutes in (always) bad traffic. But then again, cabs in Beijing are very cheap...It's about a $7 fare. Cabs are readily available at the front of the hotel 24/7. Or just take a taxi to a nearby subway (for half that price) and take the train (for something like 25 cents)."
"Aug 4 2008 	Very good business hotel	Very good location on 3rd ring road. Near a nice mall with supermarket and Starbucks, and other food court type options. Room was very comfortable with all usual amenities/services of 4-5 star hotel. Must ask for nonsmoking hall since my second stay during trip was on smoking hall/room. The room was ok but walking down the hall with others who smoked and left the doors open was quite unpleasant.Restaurant was good for western and chinese foods. Breakfast was really good for all the options available.Lobby was attractive and staff was quite good. I found that the best service was from the asst mgr versus the young staff at front desk. They did all that is expected but English was only fair. Friendly to the max but communication is always a challenge.Cost was outstanding as booked by local customer, 580 rmb. May 8 2008 	Very Nice Hotel	Just got back from a 10 day stay in the Fujian Hotel in Beijing. Staff is excellent - front desk to housekeeping. I had a problem getting the WIFI to work and within 10 minutes they sent someone to my room to set it up. Free WIFI is the BEST!Room clean and pleasant,comfy bed, free fresh fruit provided every other day, mini bar with the usuals, free bottled water also provided- 2 in the am and another one at night. Full compliment of toiletries plus a razor, comb, sewing kit. TV with HBO and CNN for you non-Chinese speakers. Free Eng version of China Daily for the govt-issued news. Lots of sprucing up going on in April, I assume for the Olympic rush. Carpet in my room a bit worn, but I suspect it is on the renovation list. Small shop on ground floor for necessities. Breakfast buffet with all the Chinese and Western food you can want. I was charmed by the effort of everyone to greet me -an obvious westerner - in English, responding to my halting Ni hao with &quot;Good evening Madam&quot;. Dec 31 2007 	Excellent hotel at this price	Fujian Hotel is one of the best hotel I stayed in China. I have stayed there several times each year for the last several year. The price is currently around RMB 580. The staff is excellent and willing to accomadate your need. The internet connection has been improved a lot and is very fast now. In comparison with other hotels at this price I stayed in Beijing and Shanghai, this is the best. The breakfast is mixed with Chinese and western styles and is very good. The location of this hotel is very convinient, next to the third highway circle, 20-30 min from airport and easy to go to anywhere in Beijing. Jun 30 2007 	a week in Fujian	Hotel is a nice hotel. Difficutly finding people that speak English, but they do a good effort and are very hospitable and polite. The room service food is not at all what you'd expect coming from europe. Had a plate of salmon, but it came delivered half frozen. The main drawback to the hotel is that the Beijing international fair is a 20-25 minute cab ride and that the toilet is in the middle of the bathroom. Aside from that, the hotel is a very pleasnt stay. Hope you're not to much into watching TV caue you only have CNN and HBO in english. Mar 21 2006 	About what you'd expect	This hotel was booked for me by a client and I had no idea what to expect. However, it is just fine.A Chinese friend describes it as 'a new hotel'. Guests are a mix of Chinese and westerners. I guess the standard is similar to what I'd expect from a 4 star hotel in, say, Paris or Edinburgh and better than some I've stayed in in those cities. Good sized rooms - about what you'd get in the US.So not the stellar experience you'd get at the Marriott in Shanghai, but perfectly fine - and cheap.The staff were friendly but the standard of English was rather patchy - that's to be expected in Beijing at this time, though. Frankly, having turned up in China knowing five words of Mandarin and seven Chinese characters I didn't expect to be understood first time. So, for instance, I had trouble explaining that I wanted to iron my shirts (not wash them). Once that was sorted, room service was pretty speedy.The beds are very hard, but not uncomfortable. Pillows are man-made and rather spongy.Internet is free - which is great.The TV only had CNN and HBO in English - I didn't notice any other languages other than 30 or so Chinese channels, a couple of which had English subtitles.Food was not great but not bad - my room service lamb curry was far from what I'd expect in the UK, with chunks of pineapple on top, but the meat was good quality. The portion size was Chinese, not American, but that's not a bad thing!One interesting point, the entrance to the hotel is at the back of the building. The entrance at the front leads to a bank who are obviously used to hapless westerners turning up looking for accommodation."
"Sep 28 2009 	adequate	As far as I've noticed, this hotel is aimed mainly at large groups who travel across China. So, from that point of view, it's a typical city business hotel with a good location, spacious rooms and lots of facilities but with a lack of attention to a single guest. All they do is check-in and check-out - one groups comes, another one goes. The only thing to fault is the breakfast. Not much of choice, very crowded and noisy. Location is just across the corner of main shopping and walking streets. The highway in front of the hotel is busy, but I didn't notice much noise from it. Rooms were spacious and clean, bed - comfortable. Sep 27 2009 	A good choice for staying in Beijing	Stayed in 2006: very good at that time, even better now. On Sep 2009 we stayed at Gloria four nights. The location is convenient, few minutes walk to the underground station. In fact we reached the hotel from the airport by underground. Very good staff at the desk, english speaking. We choose a deluxe room: it was very large, always clean and completely renovated. The breakfast was outstanding: a wide range of western and chinese food. Price: a good deal.Definitely a good choice. Aug 13 2009	Disappointing	We stayed here as part of a Jules Verne tour of China.Compared to the other hotels we stayed in this one was disappointing. Rooms ok but they didn't provide enough toilet paper or replace used shampoos. There was internet access in the bedrooms but it was very expensive. Carpets etc slighty stained . Wardrobe area small and only a couple of hangers. Some rooms had bath robes but ours didn't . We had requested a non smoking room and were given a room on the non smoking floor but it stank of smoke so we insisted on moving to another room.The buffet dinner in cafe style restaurant was very good value but breakfast was poor. Too small a restaurant for the number of rooms so it was a bit chaotic, no where to sit , no staff to clear tables and food running out . Gift shop sign said it opened at 7am so I had planned to buy a few last minute gifts on the morning we left but it didn't open on time and reception said it might be 10am before it opened . Drinks, coffees etc very expensive .It did have a leisure centre and indoor pool but it was compulsory to wear a swimming cap which they charged approx £3 each for . May 21 2009 	Better than expected	We stayed here for 3 nights following a cruise and the hotel was a pleasant surprise. Our room was large and well appointed, clearly refurbished recently. The location is quite convenient, close to an underground station and within an easy walk of shops and restaurants. The worst thing was probably the restaurant which was quite basic and I would suggest walking out to others, for example the Marriott over the road. Breakfast can be crowded if you time it wrong and I suggest either going quite early (say 7.00am) or about 8.30. Choice was satisfactory if not very exciting Dec 6 2008 	Convenient location	The hotel is located within walking distance to Beijing railway Station and underground station, which is very handy for sightseeing. The lobby and public areas look nice, however the room furniture was a bit old. Breakfast buffet is good, but I would prefer more variety.The concierge staff very nice and helpful with very good level of English. Overall good hotel. Dec 2 2008	Even Better than Last Year	In our review last year we expressed satisfaction with this hotel with our only reservation being that although clean, the hotel rooms were a little &quot;tired&quot; and could do with some TLC. I am pleased to report that on our return to the hotel again this year for a four day stay following a cruise across from Vancouver we were very pleased to see that the information given to us last year had been carried out. They said that rooms would be largely stripped and redecorated. I cannot vouch for every room having been finished but our room this year was second to none. Deep pile carpets, new furniture and the beds were certainly a vast improvement. Excellent.Staff and restaurants excellent.Beijing was again a delight to visit and the city was obviously carrying on the celebrations from the Olympic Games. The city was truly covered in flowers and was a sight to be remembered.So where was all the polluted air - I seen worse back home in England. Clear blue skies every day.We travelled out via Terminal 5 at Heathrow and we were quite impressed at the time - that is until we travelled home through Beijing's Terminal 3 which made poor old Terminal 5 look like a rather large greenhouse. At 20% larger than all Heathrows terminals put together it was awesome - and surprisingly no objections to all the photographs being taken by the population at large.We cannot wait to visit again.Philip and Sue. Oct 24 2008 	Could use a remodelling	Nothing to report. Good location. Could use some remodelling but it perfectly suited our needs. Jun 13 2008	Good Hotel	We stayed at the Gloria Plaza at the start of a three week tour of China with VJV.It is a large comfotable hotel which well justifies its four stars.The rooms are large, light and airy and the bathrooms are of similar standard.The breakfasts are excellent. We did not try the other meals.Location is central and very good. Staff friendly and helpful, as they were at all the other hotels in China.The drinks prices were the most expensive we encountered in China. Not only alcoholic beverages, but also soft drinks and water.Top Tip. There is a little kiosk right next to the hotel. Buy your drinks there. There is plenty of space in the room fridge. The beers and soft drinks were good and the Great Wall red wine drinkable. We decided not to chance the &quot;Johnny Workers Black Labial&quot; Apr 15 2008 	A Great Deal Great Location Solid Hotel	My wife and I stayed at the Gloria Plaza for nine nights during our recent trip to Beijing (April 2008). The hotel is well situated, near the Embassy area, shopping, Forbidden City, etc...We found it clean and the staff very friendly. The food in the resurant was fair, room amenities nice, and overall service quite good.The staff will, no doubt, be learning more English, but we found the existing level of English fine. The hotel has a nice fitness room (included in your room rate), and serveral restaurants. This is my third stay (my wife's second) at the Gloria Plaza...We highly recommend it as a safe, well-situated, moderately priced hotel with very good service (in our case, we also had a panoramic view of the city, + CNN.. My next time in Beijing, I am heading to the Gloria Plaza.PS My only negative is the carpeting..time for an update. Jan 15 2008 	The worse hotel in China I have ever stayed	Well, we stayed there only one night and I can say that is the worse hotel in China I have ever been (and I stayed at least in 10 of them).The only plus is its location but just acros the road you can find another one which is much better (even if that one is not the best either- beijing International Hotel).1. Staff is rude and does not show any respect for their guests - which is very unusual for China or at least Beijing.2. Rooms are ugly and poorly equipped comparing with other hotels.3. Reservation was made for two single beds and after all me and my friend was offered to share 1 bed, because they had no enough of rooms and since it was late night and it was cold we had no other option. (The other guy had the same problem and he also had his reservation done 1 month in advance). So, it was not unlucky day for us only in this hotel.So, if you look for few days vacation in nice hotel. Check something else but Gloria Plaza. I can recommend Temple of Heaven, Holiday Inn. For the same or almost the same value you will find there all you miss in this old, ugly roomed hotel. Aug 19 2007 	Lovely hotel in central location	We stayed at the Gloria Plaza Hotel for 5 nights booked through Cosmos Tourama. The holiday was absolutely fantastic!We were picked up from the airport by by our guide, Sally, who along with our driver was at our service throughout the trip. We certainly got the V.I.P. treatment.The hotel has a grand spacious entrance and a nice lounge area where you can have a coffee or a drink and watch people coming and going. There is also a small shop in the foyer which is handy for picking up a snack, a last minute present or in our case a really handy fold-away rucksack.The hotel is very central and you get a great view from the large picture windows of the busy city. We enjoyed watching the people travel on their bikes carrying their wares.Our room was large, nothing grand, but with no complaints either. It had a nice picture window and was clean and tidy.The hotel has a fitness studio, swimming pool and beauty saloon. You have to wear a swimming cap for the pool and can buy them there.Only wish we had more time to make more use of the lovely pool.Breakfast was superb - buffet with everything you could possibly want and more. Chefs on hand to make you waffles, omlete etc. We had a buffet meal one evening which was very good. Cost approx £35 which included a bottle of red wine. A lady playing the Grand Piano was a nice touch.Although our driver took us everywhere the location was central and the Friendship Store is just up the road for some shopping and there is a McDonalds just round the corner if you want to eat McDonalds in China!!We did all the tourist things in Beijing. We enjoyed the rickshaw ride through the Hotung (Old Town) where we visited a Kindergarten and had lunch with a Chinese family - the food was wonderful. If you like markets and barganing, then try the Silk Market. I found the people a bit too aggressive and if it wasn't for our tour guide would have paid £35 for a handbag which she managed to get down to £7. Was dubious about the 'Diesel' t-shirts we bought for our son but they have washed well.The tour guides are obligated to take you to the Jade factory, silk factory etc. We found them interesting but the sales people in the Jade factory were pushy. The tour guide gets commission on purchases but is also charged if you do not visit the factory.We also took a day trip by plane to Xian to see the Terracota Warriers which was well worth a visit. Again we were taken to the 'factories' with pushy sales people but quickly made our exit and at least the tour guide has carried out her obligations.We made the most of our 5 days, learned a lot, walked the wall - came home tired but happy. Jul 20 2007 	Great Location marginal Room	Definately a 2 star hotel. We stayed here on a Pacific Delight Tour. The location is fabulous, however the hotel needs some serious work. The rooms were clean, but the usual signs of decay and dirty grout were all over. Good Stuff: Location (5 mins walk to Silk Alley, my China Construction ATMs, and a Beijing 2008 Olympic store). Close to Tianamen Square and some other good locations. Price: The morning buffet. Close to McDonalds. Close to a corner market with some water and chips available.Bad Stuff: the Room was marginal. It was clean, but certainly not stellar. If this hotel were fixed up, it would be very high on my list. Jul 3 2007 	Must be better hotels in Beijing	We selected the hotel due to its location which is excellent.On arrival, we were allocated a very small room, which smelt badly of smoke. We complained and were moved to a better room on the 8th floor. However, it was still rather shabby and we had problems getting the key to work.The staff on the front desk were terrible, and – despite speaking adequate English - were officious and unhelpful. On our first day they refused to change a travellers cheque as they claimed that the signatures were not identical(!) This could have caused us a great problem if we had not had our ATM cards.The staff in the restaurant were also very unhelpful (one morning we had to ask 4 different people for a spoon!) Smoking is allowed in the restaurant (even at breakfast), and there is only one small ‘no smoking’ area, although ironically this is the furthest point away from the buffet! This means that there were several people smoking heavily, sitting only inches away from the breakfast buffet, which most Western people will find rather unpleasant.If you chose to have dinner in the restaurant, the food is bland, the service is poor and you will pay approximately double what you would pay in a nearby restaurant.The concierge was polite and helpful, and did recommend a good local restaurant.We enjoyed Beijing tremendously. Based on our experiences of the Chinese people in general (polite, helpful, eager to please etc.), I am sure there are better hotel options available.Nearby places to eat: •‘Emporer Duck’ on the main road (ask the concierge for details)•Pizza Hut (if you need a break from Chinese food … spotlessly clean, efficient service and very cheap) Apr 14 2007 	Good location facelifting required.	Stayed there five days in 2006 november. Bed&amp;Breakfast. Very convenient location - several subway stations from center, no problems to get there by taxi even when the traffic was busy. Got a very good view from our room - ancient tower with some old astronomy tools on top and old Beijing city wall. But the room needed radical repair - not terrible, but too out of date, especially the bathroom. Rooms clean but not very clean. Breakfast was OK, we had no problems. Restaurants and service - very good. Personnel - helpful. So the rooms finishing and appliances is not 4 stars, everything else - defintely is 4 stars quality. A good place to drop your luggage and do Beijing sightseeing. Mar 16 2007 	Exceeded our expections	Having read some the the reviews on this hotel, we were a bit concerned. However, our experience was nothing like the other reviewers. Our room was spacious, clean and comfortable. The staff were friendly and the public areas were clean and well-maintained. The breakfast buffet had something for all cultures and tastes. Granted the scrambled eggs and bacon were a little less done than our preference, but there were other options. We did not have a massage, regrettably, but another person in our tour group did and was very pleased, especially for the cost--about $25US. We walked in the area and felt safe. Beware of the local pedicab drivers--we had one who tried to charge us $200US!! While in Beijing, do NOT miss a tour of one of the hutongs--our favorite part of the trip, getting to meet locals, etc. Mar 3 2007	Awful	Unless this hotel has been demolished and rebuilt over the last couple of years when we visited, avoid. We stayed here for a couple of nights before a Princess cruise. Our room was disgusting - dirty,dark,worn furniture and stinking of smoke. We were shown to our room via a wedding reception ( sorry folks) , the hotel kitchen ( we didn't eat in the hotel) and the service lift. The public areas looked ok but the corridors and rooms were worn and dirty. also, the staff were not particluarly helpful and failed to conatct us when our tour guide arrived. ` They also made no effort to deal with our complaint re the room. Jan 27 2007	3 star hotel in need of a face -lift.	Stayed in Gloria Plaza Hotel for 5 nights this January, and even though it definetely is not a 4 star hotel, people should expect a pleasant stay in a 3 star hotel. The lobby is quite large , but the reception stuff even though not rude are not wellcoming. The rooms are quite spacious but worn out and in need of a renovation . Breakfast was okay , with an omellete and waffle station, but it seems like non smokers are not appreciated and people can smoke anywhere they want... The hotel pool and the sauna were a plus and the price catalogue for the spa services quite reasonable.The subway station is very near the hotel, but what with the taxis being sooooo cheap it really is a lot better to just ask the bell boys write on a paper the place you are interested in going in chinese ( cab drivers do not speak english AT ALL !!! ) , rather than waste your time with the metro.... Near the lobby there is a desk where you can book your excursions , but it is a lot more expensive rather than booking them at the airport upon arrival. All in all, we had a pleasant stay in Beijing and did not have any problems with the hotel even though I have to specify that in deed the hotel is a bit worn out and needs a renovation. Sep 29 2006	Awful in parts	Walk out of pleasant public areas into filthy corridors and scruffy bedrooms, sheets spotless but carpets filthy and covered with burns, grubby walls and furniture. Breakfast has potential to be good but could not cope with number of customers, only one bright spot - lovely supper&gt; Sep 27 2006	I'd look for a better hotel	My husband and I stayed at the Gloria Plaza Hotel for 5 nights between 9/21 - 9/26. The hotel location is great, which is probably the only good thing about this hotel. It is very close to a subway station, and Silk Street and other main tourist attractions are couple stops away.The lobby of the hotel is nice, and certainly gives you hope. The check in experience was certainly interesting. I don't know why, but it seems that chinese people culturally just simply don't respect the concept of a line. Before anybody flips out, I am chinese, but spent most of my life in the US. My husband is american. Anyways, there were clearly velvet ropes available in front of every person at the check in counter, but people would just walk up and talk to the check in person, and the check in person would do nothing to rectify that. Finally I just got fed up and told the intruder to get to the back of the line. The staff at the hotel is more or less not friendly. THere was no greeting, no &quot;welcome to our hotel&quot;, just asked me for my last name, form of payment, sign here, and handed me the key. I'm not sure if that's just their standard way of operating or it was a fluke since there was a huge tour group checking in. Anyhoo, 0 points for hospitality so far.Changing money with my traveler's checks was also a nightmare. Apparently the hotel staff has never seen a check that has two authorizing signatures, so that took a while to sort out. THe rooms were at best, livable. Definitely not 4 stars. Beds were hard, bathroom was moldy and gross, and the carpet was suspect. They do give you slippers, so definitely use those, as well as bathrobes. Bring an alarm clock, I'm not sure why they don't have one.Three days in a row my room keys did not work when I got back to my room with bags of stuff. I demanded an explanation, and I got the usual &quot;you must have your key near a credit card, cellphone etc.&quot; which is certainly not true since I had none of those on me. Mind you, this happened to both our keys, which was carried separately by me and my husband. Breakfast buffet was nothing to write home about. They had a mixture of western and eastern food. As well as an omelet station and waffle station. Get there before 8:30 if you can, to beat the tour group rushes. They don't do a very good job of refilling food.So overall, I doubt I'd stay there again.As a side note, due to the Chinese national day, 10/1, as well as the upcoming 2008 olympics, a lot of the main attractions within tourist sites are under renovations. Just ask when you buy tickets what's opened and what's closed, but even then you may not get a straight answer. When possible, buy an all inclusive ticket, or they'll nickel and dime you for every temple you want to check out. Apr 7 2006	Great Hotel	Just returned from a 5-night stay at the Gloria Plaza Hotel in Beijing with a group of 26 people. Everyone thought this hotel was fabulous. Location is the greatest feature of this hotel. Breakfast buffet was awesome, with made-to-order omlets. Rooms were clean and spacious, but looked a little worn or &quot;tired.&quot; Although bathroom was covered with white marble tile, it looked old. Grout was missing in some places, and faucets and shower head were old, but mirror was very large and semi wrap-around. A face-lift of the rooms would do wonders for this otherwise great hotel. Lobby and dining rooms were fabulous as they were recently refurbished. Staff was most courteous. Would definitely stay there again. Feb 25 2006	Helpful staff and good location	I stayed here and arrived very late at night. The staff couldn't change any money but were most helpful in tidying me over until the exchange desk opened in the morning.I wanted to visit some nearby shopping centres and asked to book a car. The staff advised that it would be cheaper $ 2.00 to take a taxi each way than book a car for $30.00.Hotel restaurants were good and rooms were clean and spacious.Local restaurants and convenience stores within a few minutes walk of the hotel although English is a bit of a problem but got by on sign language.All in all an excellent hotel and location. I have just booked to stay there again this year. Dec 15 2005	Great Breakfast Buffet; Dim Sum restaurant expensive	The strangest thing I noticed was that there were no alarm clocks in the rooms. I guess you could arrange a wakeup call. But with jet lag, it was hard to tell time without a clock.The dim sum restaurant on the ground floor is quite expensive, meaning paying like you're in PF Chang's. But if you'd go out, you could probably find cheaper places. They had 2 girls serving you hand and foot.September temp/weather was perfect, although we did have a rainy first day. Nov 11 2005	Great location	We enjoyed our stay here. My husband, two friends and I stayed here for a week. The buffet was extensive. The staff friendly and helpful, especially the bell services. After a full day with a cab driver whom we had decided was more a friend than a driver, a bell service person helped us communicate our gratitude. Aug 24 2005	Very good hotel	I would like to inform people who might be visiting Beijing China, and want to stay at Gloria Plaza hotel, that it's a very good hotel, with high standard.The rooms are clean, with private bath, TV, a/c, mini bar, and electric kettle.You have every day, complementary 2 bottles of water, free of charge, and the rooms are spacy and most important clean.The breakfast at the hotel is very rich, with variety of cuisine and taste.The people at the hotel were very friendly with us, and tried to help us as much as they could.The hotel is very near the Silk market. You can even walk there, if it is not too hot and humid, and there is also a Metro station opposite the hotel if you want to move around with tube. Jul 24 2005	Go elsewhere!	The rooms are horrible and not very clean. I found someone else's hair in my bathtub as well as in my bed sheets. There are cigarette burns on the carpet and the furniture is old, threadbare and smells musty. Service is minimal and English is not very well understood when I called to inform them that the bathtub drain doesn't work very well. It took an hour for the bellbop to bring up my luggage and another hour for room service when they had quoted 20 minutes and they got my order wrong plus gave me attitude when I called it in! The quality of the buffet breakfast is not very good and the bed is rock-hard and feel that I may as well sleep on the floor. For the price, I suppose I should feel that I'm getting a good deal- but I think I'd rather pay extra for a 5-star hotel like the Sheraton Great Wall Beijing since this 4-star Gloria Plaza Hotel certainly does not live up to its rating. This place is sub-standard and best compares to the worst motels in the USA. Sep 22 2004	A pleasant stay	I stayed at the Gloria Plaza in November of 2002.This is a large, western style hotel, in the southeast of Beijing. It is on a main East West Avenue, and I was able to walk to many of the places I wanted to visit, as well as restaurants and shops.The room was large, even by western standards, clean, EVERYTHING WORKED!!! (well, actually it was always a bit overheated for my taste)The staff and concierge were helpful, spoke English but were willing to bear with my Mandarin, and seemed genuinely interested in conversation with me.The breakfast buffet was great.Don't miss the Ming Dynasty Jesuit Observatory Tower accross the steet. Nov 22 2009 	?????????? Nov 6 2009 	????? Nov 4 2009 	Bell'hotel! Jul 5 2008	Hotel mit gutem Preis Leistungsverhältnis"
"VERY BEIJING HOTEL IN CENTER	we passed Shanghai to go to Beijing and spend 4 nights there with all our trip to China finish china.I stayed at the Grand Hotel for 4 nights with my wife The Hotel is in a central location (close to the Forbidden City and Tienanmen Square.). the room quite expensive but the quality of the room we could not say any thing and the best.Stuff is very friendly and customer oriented (a part from some managers), and most of them speak English. - The Chinese restaurant has excellent food. - The restaurant which serves breakfast is mediocre, but as compensation, staff is very friendly and helpful with professor in the jobWe really loved our trip in China. Sep 29 2009	Superb location luxurious	As we stayed only one night, we were unable to take more than a superficial view of the superbly located Grand, the nearest luxury hotel to the Forbidden City and Tian'anmen Square. But we liked what we saw and experienced.Our large room was elegantly furnished and overlooked the Forbidden City, offering a magical dawn view. The buffet breakfast was good but we have had better in China. Apart from a rather confused check in of our 15 person group, service was pleasant and efficient, although not all staff are fluent in English.We were left with the impression that this hotel caters more to Chinese than western visitors. Aug 19 2009 	Grand	I haven't stayed in a 5* hotel before. Now i know. We were a familygroup of 9 people, age 6 month to 65 years. We stayed in this hotel for 6 days. We got a great prize on the internet via octopustravel.com. We came and were upgraded immediateley because we were staying for 6 days. That meant we got a view to the forbidden city. The rooms were spaciuos and clean and just great. Soft enough madrass. The staff were great and helpful. My sister has a daughter. She is 6 years old, and she cried because she got hungry at 1:00 am. My sister called for the staff in despair of what to do. The staff got some food for her and everything went alright at 1:00am, for free. Oh my god. Is it possible i thought. Never heard of this before. The hotel has a good location. Close to forbidden city, Tiananmen Square, Wangfujing street. 10 minutes to silkmarket with taxi. What i didn't like. Although my sister got a free meal for her daughter, the prize of drinks were expensive. More than in Norway where i come from. Maybe because it is a 5*hotel. Aug 17 2009 	great location / average facilities	I stayed at the Grand Hotel for 4 nights with my husband and my 2 kids (5 and 8 years old) The Hotel is in a central location (close to the Forbidden City and Tiananmen Square.)Stuff is very friendly and customer oriented (a part from some managers), and most of them speak English. We took 2 connecting rooms. Connecting rooms apparently are only available with “view” on the Forbidden City. Our rooms were relatively spacey, nice furniture, comfortable beds (not the typical hard Chinese bed) and clean. The view was a bit disappointing.The bath tube was scratched, but a part from this the room was very nice.Breakfast was fine, nothing spectacular for a European (the croissant were not the best I had in china) and the choice was a good balance between Chinese and Western cuisines.However, food was not always good at the Grand Hotel. - The Chinese restaurant has excellent food. - The restaurant which serves breakfast is mediocre, but as compensation, staff is very friendly. - The tea house is a bit disappointing as the choice of teas is limited compared to what one can normally get in other places in Beijing. Furthermore the manager does not seems to be particularly flexible to accommodate customer needs (We wanted to finish drinking our tea in the room as the kids appeared to be very tired, but apparently this was not allowed.) - The bar was a disappointment. They charged us 100 Yuan (approx 11€) for 2 glasses of milk for our kids (and that was considered a favour as they usually do not sell milk) The bar closes at midnight, and with that everything closes down. It seems that the whole hotel closes down at midnight. One does not even get an ashtray to smoke in one of the smoking areas after midnight, nor a drink.Besides, as the kitchens close at 21:30 and at the same time shows in town start between 19 and 19:30. and end between 21:00 and 21:30 dinner at the hotel seems impossibleA longer kitchen time would have made our life easier!We also used their spa and took a ‘Chinese massage.’ The massage was great, really well done. The only strange note is that, while receiving the massage, my husband got offered sexual services.In summaryPositive: location, comfortable and cleaned rooms, friendly staffNegative: mediocre food, evening closing timeAlthough we were fine at the grand hotel if I ever go back to Beijing I would probably look for another hotel. I saw far better hotels in China and also better Leading Hotels of the World, and the price does not completely matches expectation. Aug 13 2009 	Great Service/Great Location/Great Rooms/Average Facilities	For a Chinese hotel this hotel did have very personalized service. Introduced us to the room, helped us map out attractions and ordered tickets to shows. Very good service. Perfect location, walking distance to Tianenman, Forbidden City and Wangfungching also has a MRT station across the street. We had a Forbidden City View room, which was very nice and comfortable. Flat screen TV with a somewhat traditional chinese decor. The rest of the hotel seems a little dated and the breakfast was weak, but for service it was top notch (especially for Chinese hotels). Also, everyone still smokes in China, so there is smoking in the hotel which is annoying at times.We also stayed at the Grand Millenium in the CBD. Amazing facilities there, but they didn't have the same level of service that the Grand Beijing did. Jun 30 2009 	Great location but room smell	This hotel is located in a most conveninent location to all the top tourist spots (Forbidden city, Tianman Square,..etc). This could be a negative if one wants to avoid the tourist crowd. It is an old, elegant hotel with history. Service is good. The only problem we encountered was that the rooms we stayed has bad smell sometimes found in old hotel. We stayed there for 6 nigths in two different rooms (all on 6th floor) and both rooms have the same bad smell. Initially we thought it would go away with AC on for a few hours but it didn't improve and in fact seems to get worse. We informed the cleaning staff and they couldn't get rid of the smell. This is not acceptable for a hotel of this class. Other than this problem, everything else with this hotel was satisfactory. Restaurant is good. It is expensive by Beijing standard but reasonable compared to fine US restaurants.I don't know whether the problem is limited only to a few rooms or widespread. Ask to switch to a room on a different floor right away if you encounter this problem. May 24 2009 	Excellent	As I write this, I'm about to leave after 8 nights at the Grand hotel. It far exceeded my expectations in terms of quality with large, clean rooms and an outstanding location. I travel a lot for work and stay in different 5 star hotels almost on a weekly basis, so I'm comparing this with some of the best out there.Don't trust the website photos, it looks much better in real life! The photos on there are old and outdated, my room has a good bed (not a hard china bed), a brand new plasma TV as well as some nice chinese style furniture. I'll try and upload some photos later.If you are the type that enjoys peace and quiet and can't sleep through a bit of noise, request a room out the back of the hotel, the rooms facing chang an avenue can get noisy early in the morning with roadworks and traffic. The gym and pool are okay, but for the fitness freaks out there, it's not the best. Breakfast is okay without being outstanding(i hate hotel breakfasts anyway, so don't take my word for it)As for location, you can't beat it, it's the closest hotel to tiananmen square/forbidden city and only a very short walk to the wangfujing shopping area. For the price, it's very hard to beat and I'd defintiely consider staying here again. Mar 27 2009 	Traditional hotel	A traditional hotel at the heart of the city. Tradtional spacious rooms with a luxurious feel. Excellent breakfast for all tastes. The staff very friendly, polite, helpfull and professional.Fantastic location for those who like to visit The Forbidden City and the Tiananmen Square. Dec 2 2008 	Great location	Great location within Beijing. Could walk to the Forbidden City, Tianamen Square, Wafujing Street and all its shopping, the Night Market, etc. We stayed here at the beginning of our trip and at the end. Concierge was great, front desk was helpful except for one hiccup. On our second stay we were &quot;upgraded&quot; to a room, 4113, a handicap room. It happens to sit over the bar and they play really loud classical music, stringed instruments. It sounded like there was a violinist in our room while we were trying to sleep. My husband called the front desk at 10 pm (we were waking up early to catch tours the next day) and asked for the music to be turned down. The front desk girl basically told him she hoped &quot;he could close his eyes and go to sleep.&quot; We were transferred to another room the next night without a problem. Oct 31 2008	Centrally Located Very Good Service Luxury Feel	We stayed here as part of our China tour. It is very centrally located just a few blocks from Tienemen Square and the Forbidden City. Our room had a marble bath with separate shower and tub, with generous toiletry ameneties. Hard bed but typical in China, small loveseat and chair for seating, with dpendable Wifi. ( Expect Chinese sensorship when you go to certain sites.) Gorgeous attended indoor pool and health club with adjacent lounge room, all spotless. Large indoor atrium with 3rd floor lounge for reading and relaxing, as small lobby has little to no seating. Large air morning dining room with bountiful Asian and Western breakfast buffet for guests. This hotel is attached to another luxury hotel next door with indoor passage to their lobby and facilities as well. I did not eat in this hotel's restaurants or lounges so I cannot comment on them. You will feel well cared for in this hotel. Oct 7 2008 	Best In Bejing	This was our second stop in China and the beds did not get any softer. We had paid extra for a Forbidden City View room. On the days there was no smog we could see the rooftops of the Forbidden City and the flags over Tianaman Square. I do feel it was worth it and we were located on the 8th floor. The noise from the city below was still quite loud but all buildings around the Forbidden City are quite low due to building restrictions. Free toiltries in the rooms and a kettle. Great gym, pool and free tai chi lessons every morning if you wanted to give it a try. Good selection for breakfast and one of the best concierge services I have ever known. Nothing was too much trouble for the staff and they did whatever they could to find what you needed. I would definately stay here again. Sep 13 2008 	Truly Grand!	This hotel is a deal for its price and yes I know the price is not that low. It has possibly the best location in the city for a tourist oriented hotel. You can literally spit on the Forbidden City it is so close (not that you’d want to do that). It is also located literally next door to Tiananmen and also some of the largest malls and shopping areas in Beijing. The hotel is located right next to the Wangfujing station on Line 1 of the metro which makes it easy to get anywhere including the Olympic area. The insides of the building were very well appointed. The lobby has some beautiful wood carvings. All the common areas have a luxurious well-constructed feel. The rooms are beautifully finished. The bathrooms have a tub and shower which are both very luxurious. There is enough marble that you feel you are in a quarry. Everything is very clean. The toilet is so clean that it has a rose petal for you to pee on if you are so lucky to make it their before anyone else. The rooms also have desks and a sitting area. The rooms feature views looking out over a smog shrouded forbidden city that is quite beautiful. You can also enjoy a superb view from the pricey restaurant upstairs. The pool and fitness center are also quite nice. The breakfast is quite expansive and features an array of Western and Eastern tastes. The staff was also very helpful and professional. The concierge knows where everything in the city is. If you are looking to find this hotel it has a beautiful and colorful traditional style gate in front of it. May 15 2008 	good hotel in excellent position	We stayed at the Grand as part of an extended tour of China booked with a tour operator.We liked the position as our room overlooked the Forbidden City (when you see it through the smog). Entrance gate is attractive and staff are very attentive.Rooms were attractive, food was good.We walked through the adjoining hotels to the shopping area which worth the walk just to compare hotels. Mar 28 2008	Excellent Hotel	This is an excellent, luxury hotel with impeccable appointments and service. Yes, it is expensive, but I did not feel that it is overpriced. The hotel does not attract the tonier set of the Grand Hyatt, for example, and is not as trendy, which was fine with me. I was very comfortable here. One caveat: the restaurants in the hotel, with the exception of the breakfast Red Wall Cafe are uninspired. Jan 30 2008	Great Location	We spent 5 nights at the Grand Hotel on the last leg of our tour. This was the oldest of all the hotels in China that we stayed in but it was quite comfortable. The Atrium is lovely, however, at night there is often musical entertainment and the noise filters through to the rooms. Our room faced onto the main road and I have never seen so many cars, which of course is one of the reasons for the smog in Beijing. However we were far enough back that the traffic noise wasn't an issue. The room was a little shabby and really is ready for a bit of a refurbishment but I hope they don't lose the hotel's character in the process. Breakfast was excellent.For a tourist this hotel is well positioned. Within walking distance to the Forbidden City and Tiananmen Square. There is a lovely park across the road from the hotel and it extends right through to the walls of the Forbidden City. Well worth checking out. Also within easy walking distance to the shopping areas. Very friendly and helpful staff at the lobby desk. Would recommend. Jan 1 2008 	Nice but not worth the money	We liked the hotel's proximity to the Forbidden City and Wangfujing. The rooms are fine and the breakfast wonderful but for the price I much prefered the Novotel Peace hotel a couple of blocks away. Oct 20 2007 	great location comfy hotel	We stayed in the Grand Hotel on the final leg of our honeymoon. We arrived on 2nd October amid the national holiday. Beijing was buzzing, the streets were packed but inside our hotel was dead. Reception left a lot to be desired. Our room was nice and comfortable. Lovely big comfortable bed and lovely bathroom with seperate shower and bath. We had a view of the roofs of the forbidden city and Tian amen Square from our room which was spectacular. We had room service everyday and it was nice and tasty although breakfast was not great but that is to be expected. The Atrium bar is lacking in any atmosphere even the staff are bored. There didn't appear to be anyone dining in the restaurants so we didn't either. Everyone was outside soaking up the atmosphere. location is superb. Literally minutes walk from Forbidden City, Tian amen Square and Wangfung jing Street. (Sorry spelling!) We got taxis to the two bar / restaurant districts which were an experience. There isn't really much night life in the area of the hotel. Everything is cheap! We did a trip to the Great Wall, Ming Tombs and a Jade factory which was organised through another hotel, why doesn't the Grand Hotel do this?? I could not understand why a leading hotel of the world would have only passable customer service. Maybe this is just China. All in all the location was great and it is a very comfortable and clean hotel. It lacks a bit of ambience and a little bit of extra customer service but we still had a very pleasant stay. The Beijing Hotel and Raffles Hotel next door may have been a better option for that little bit extra. Oct 5 2007 	Great Location and good service at the Grand Hotel Beijing	Just returned from a China holiday.We stayed at the Grand Hotel Beijing and found the hotel to be perfectly located to all the areas we wanted to visit in the city.We had a room overlooking the inner atrium which had been renovated and was lovely. Bathroom was good and clean.I spent my 40th birthday here and a cake from the hotel arrived at the door (info taken from my passport on check-in) and made our stay even more special. The staff were very helpful in changing flights etcWe moved from the hotel to do the overnight sleep on the Wall and when we checked back in we were upgraded to a suite!! they must have seen the exhausted look on my face after walking from Jinshanling to Simatai!! The steps were a killer!!!Will definitely go back here. Sep 17 2007 	V good location and facilities	The Grand Hotel Beijing is very well located with views of the Forbidden City and 1 block away from a buzzing shopping street. On top of that they have a really nice pool &amp; sauna and spa that noone seems to use but it is really nice to go back to after a day of sightseeing. The staff at the spa were really nice &amp; helpful.  The rooms were well appointed maybe the carpet was a little old fashioned but otherwise everything worked v well. The outside of the building could do with a facelift. The front desk staff english had room for improvement but overall they were polite. Perfect for tourists, if you are business traveler and like to splash out in the most fancy place in town the new Raffles next door which is amazing! and super new.Tips for a fantastic stay in Beijing: Get a a guide as they will explain lots of stuff that otherwise you wouldn't know at all the different sites. Apart from the obvious places to go: Take rickshaw tour of the Hutongs and eat in a local house. Go to Jinshangling (2hours away by car) for the Great Wall - it is much quieter and peaceful than the place nearby. A MUST SEE: Kung Fu show - real warrior monks perform the legend of Yun-li. May 28 2007 	Good location stylish hotel	The bedrooms were furnished with lovely old Chinese furniture and some had a view to the roofs of the Forbidden CityThe restaurants were good in the hotel and there was live piano and a string quartet playing delightfully in the atrium over dinner time .Ti Chi (Sp?) could be watched and practised in the atrium about breakfast time.The staff were good.The hotel is 10 minutes walk from the pedestrian shopping street, Wangfujing St and the same distance from Tian 'an man Square and the Forbidden City. May 4 2007	One of several excellent hotels in China	Fortunately we were not put off by some of your reviewers. Our travelagent Audley Travel insisted they were wrong. What we found was a beautiful hotel with great restaurants (we tried three). So much space to relax in from secluded tea rooms to an enormous atrium. Discreet music every evening, great drinks and service matching the best. We even had a view of the Forbidden City. Apr 6 2007	No air conditioning!	This hotel is in a fantastic location. The room is well appointed, and on par with most other 5 star places. However, when I stayed in early April, they have no air-conditioning turned on! The room gets quite warm (despite it being quite chilly outside), and the best solution they have is to open the windows!!! This is pretty poor for a 5 star hotel, as the main thoroughfare to Tiananmen Square lies just outside (i.e. noisy and polluted). This is simply not good enough. Mar 16 2007	Best possible location in Beijing	This is truly a very grand hotel, but unstuffy, and the location can't be beaten - right in the heart of Beijing, a few steps away from Tiananmen Square and the Forbidden City. It was also incredibly good value (actually very cheap, for me coming from London).Service was excellent throughout and everyone is clearly making a huge effort to prepare for the Olympics next year, all staff in the hotel speak some English, including the housekeepers, and everyone is very helpful.The only downside for us that we were visiting at Chinese New Year, which meant there were very few people in the hotel (everyone goes home to be with family) and it sometimes got lonely when only two or three tables in one of the many excellent hotel restaurants were occupied. (Do try the Sichuan restaurant, it was very good.) Also everyone eats very early so they were clearing up by 8pm - if you want to eat a bit later it's better to go outside the hotel to one of the malls like Gourmet Street inside the Oriental Plaza.There is great shopping nearby as well as the sightseeing, and the subway is a very short distance. Ask for a view of the Forbidden City - it's extraordinary to be right in the heart of the city and an experience not to be missed. Feb 27 2007 	Beyond perfect experience at this lovely hotel	I booked this hotel via my travel agent, due to its prime location in the vastness that is Beijing, not knowing what to expect once I arrived. What I encountered was one of the most pleasant experiences I have ever experienced at a hotel. To begin with, the luxury of the building is apparent upon arrival. Cascading doors open to an array of concierge employees who are eager to serve in every manner possible. Upon entrance, there is a magnificent spiraling staircase to the left. Immediately in front is a 3-story tall painting that I learned later to be a national treasure and worth over $1.5 million. What is unique about this establishment is the cultural significance imbedded within each aspect of the hotel's design. In the lobby, there is an intricate carving of the Great Wall of China from a whole elephant tusk; the chairs in each room are made to resemble Ming Dynasty stools. Though it does not astonish upon first glance, the stories behind each artifact is singularly impressive. The fixtures are definitely not modern, as the hotel clearly decided to go the route of designing the place with classical charm and understated elegance. Nevertheless, the marble bathrooms and excellent furnishings in the room I received were impressive in their own right. If I had to emphasize one point regarding the Grand Hotel Beijing, it would be its exceptional service. As a 5-star member of the Leading Hotels of the World, I would expect nothing less, but each employee I encountered went above and beyond what I have experienced in the past. James at the Front Desk and Samuel and Allen at the Service Manager station were especially noteworthy. Most were able to communicate fluently in English, but a few were difficult to understand because of their accents. The atrium that starts on the 3rd floor and rises to the top of the building is simply breathtaking. It's adorned with exotic wildlife and live music fills the room around evening time daily. The fountain bar is adjacent, and is fully stocked, though the prices were somewhat steep. On my second day, the charger to my laptop computer stopped working and I mentioned in passing to the Front Desk what could be done about this matter (I had important documents to access on the laptop). An hour later, I answered the door to find a brand new laptop charger waiting for me, free of charge. This was a new level of service I was definitely not accustomed to.Quick Pros:-Going to the Red Wall Cafe for breakfast buffet is a must-Excellent attention to detail by housekeeping-Quiet, well-maintained and beautiful indoor pool-Atrium for relaxing tea and live music-The unbeatable view of the Forbidden City/Tiananmen Square from the balcony and the outside rooftop bar-Airport pickup/dropoff in new Mercedes-Benz S550 sedans-Service, service, service!Quick Cons:-A few employees had only mediocre command of English (though none at the Concierge level, thankfully)-Lighting inside the room could've been brighterOverall: A hidden jewel that shouldn't be overlooked when staying in Beijing! Jan 11 2007	Stench	I stayed at the Peninsula. I had originally thought to stay at the Grand but after reading the reviews on Tripadvisor i opted for the Peninsula, which is btw wonderful.One mid-afternoon i decided -- with a companion -- to have high tea at the Grand. As soon as we walked in we were overpowered by a mildew smell that was so strong it stopped us dead in our tracks. We gathered our wits and moved on walking the public areas. The stench was everywhere. Along with that there were noticably worn areas in the carpet and and some furnishings -- and still that odor.We hastilly decided to beat it, but first i needed to use the men's room. Yikes! The smell was worse!I don't know what the rooms were like but I wouldn't have made it pass the front desk!So sad. Dec 22 2006 	Grand Hotel --loved it!	The Grand Hotel was booked for us by Helen Wong's Travel from Sydney and we were a little apprehensive as there had been some negative reviews on this site. Where were they staying???We were impressed with the Grand and would certainly recommend it.People have described it as &quot;old&quot; - that is interesting, the rooms were decorated old style with CHinese porcelain and rosewood furniture (a lovely change from the starkly modern chain hotels) but certainly not faded or worn.Location is excellent - next door to Forbidden city, one block from Tiananmen Square and one block in the other direction to the main shopping area of Wangfujing St.Food was excellent - cheap with impeccable service...in factw e were very impressed with the service everywhere in the hotel. Drinks were expensive - but theres a 40% tax on alcohol in China so drinks are expensive everywhere! Mind you, Tsingdao, the local beer is not bad and half the price of imported stuff.Staff were friendly and polite whenever we needed anything.All in all we were very happy in our 5 day stay at the Grand. Sure Raffles may be nicer, but a lot more expensive. We'll be back! Nov 22 2006 	Convenient nice but a little worn	Warning -Upselling: We arrived at the hotel before 10:00 AM, and our room was not ready, which is to be expected. I told the receptionist we would just walk around. As we returned, around 11:00, the receptionist waved me over and said, our room was not ready, but if we were interested in a suite upgrade, a room was available, and if we waited, she could not guarantee a single king, which we had requested, and presumably reserved. I negotiated the price down by 1/3, but I don't particularly care for this tactic.Restaurants - very good: There is an auto 15% service charge, which is okay. Food was very good. Service was very good. Breakfast Buffet was above average. Bar drinks very expensive. Bar tab was about $40/person, for light drinks. Those funky white statues with water spouting into a fountain: One word: Shrooms.Location: Very good location and our room looked out over the forbidden city. Walking distance to major shopping area and restaurants. Very safe.Room: The suite ended up to be very nice. The hotel is in need of some upkeep (cracked marble), but very clean. The last morning, there were some repairs on the water system and the water spouted brown. A turn off, but a letter had warned of same.Room service: Okay. Pricey, but what do you expect? Very fast though and nicely presented.Bell Service and Taxi: Warning! Know where you are going and if the taxi driver hesitates, get out and request another. We were dropped off twice in the wrong locations.Service: Service personnel very nice. No haircuts available or nails (for wife). Had to go over to next hotel. Oct 26 2006 	Pleasant Unexceptional	This is a perfectly comfortable hotel. Certainly not four or five star but a solid three. The rooms are clean and comfortable and the internet access adequate although they charge separately for it. Probably would have opted for one of the other nearby hotels such as Raffles if I had not gone with the travel agencies agenda. Jul 11 2006	Past its Prime	Just returned from two days in Beijing. We stayed at the Grand Hotel. This place gets high marks for location. You are minutes from the Forbidden City and Tian amen. Of course, one could get that from the Hyatt or Raffles almost next door. The hotel facilties are dated and the smell of old was everywhere. I was reminded of the Mandarin in Hong Kong before it closed. Unfortunately the Grand has none of the charming service or attention to detail the Mandarn n Hong Kong had before it closed for renovation. The Grand Hotel was a grand disappointment and for the price, a bit of a rip off. Oct 15 2005	An Imperial Residence of the past	The Grand Hotel Beijing overlooks the Forbidden City and Tiananmen Square. However both sites are so large its impossible to really see them from any one vantage point. The view from our room is shown in the attached picture. We stayed at the Hotel for 4 nights and the service throughout was excellent, including help in arranging our trips around the city. The Hotel decor was impressive but comfortable, prices were a little expensive as you would expect.There is a roof top bar that overlooks the centre of Beijing and the Hotels location means that its only a short (5-10 min) walk onto the square or the entrance to the Forbidden City and less than 5 minutes to a large shopping area. Jun 22 2005 	good bit weird	Excellent location. Food good and cheap (equivalent in restaurant to UK Chinese takeaway prices).Hotel OK- as usual in China a lot of people each only doing a small job- one to call the elevator, for example (I can do that- I am an electrical engineer, and buttons don't faze me!)Room good, clean and a bit classy, with nice balcony- however street noisy esp at night. 27 cement mixing lorries turned up one night and mixed and poured all night.Bar area a litttle unwelcoming, with white marble everywhere, a fountain at one end of a huge room and about 10 cafe-type tables. Lounge at other end was OK. Transport from airport to hotel arranged by hotel -private car plus two people to help- a bit over the top, really. You do need the card the hotel has saying in Mandarin &quot;please take me back to the Grand hotel Beijing&quot; whenever you take a cab. Mar 30 2005	Very Comfortable	My wife, daughter and I stayed here 2 nights end Feb 2005. The room was *very* spacious, and comfortable. The room also appeared to have been recently refurbished. The breakfast buffet at the &quot;posted price&quot; was expensive at ~Y120 (~US$15/person) very good and extensive, featuring Western, Japanese and Chinese food. The indoor pool was warm and pool area had a sauna, shower and changing facilities.As the room was part of a package we do not know the rate. However as an *indicator*, the organization we were with charged extra nights which included 1 room, breakfast, and a group tour with an English speaking guide at $200 for two people.The hotel is located next to Tiananmen Sq. Mar 25 2005 	Great Place to Stay!	The location is fabulous -- adjacent to the gardens east of Forbidden City. And the rooms on the west side of the hotel actually look over the roofs of the Forbidden CIty. The rooms range from large to basketball-court sized and the rates are (I have found) somewhat negotiable. I've visited twice for business and found the breakfast buffet great, the staff immediately responsive, the Business Center quick on the pick-up, and in every respect a place I recommended to my boss -- and to you! Nov 23 2009 	Bien situado Nov 15 2009 	nouvel an à Beijing Oct 29 2009	Le must de Pékin Jun 29 2009 	???????????????????? Mar 30 2007 	excelente situacion"
"Oct 18 2009 	Great location huge rooms free internet - simple as that	I stayed at Grand Millennium 6 nights and truly enjoyed it. The only problem is that no taxi driver knew where hotel is - you have to show them the map, just name is not enough. The location tough is fantastic, everything is very close. I arrived at 6 am and although the check in officialy starts from 2 pm, lovely receptionist check me in at no extra charge. The Hotel has huge lobby, very impressive but leaves you feeling very cold. The decor is very neutral and is lacking some personal touches.The room was very big, very confordable, clean...no complaint. Bathroom is spacious with separate bath and shower. You can use internet for free, even if you don't have your own laptop, you can use huge TV and keyborad in the room. Very pleased with that. I was based on the 6th floor hence the horrible view but I guess you can't have everything. I do advice you to take higher level rooms, surely they will have better views, even if its burnt builidng opposite Grand. The restaurant is very nice, food ok, and as someone alredays mentioned tea is very weird! I booked one day trip through the hotel (400 RNB) to the Great Wall of China and Ming Tomb - I really enjoued it. It was fantastic - mostly thank you people I met on the bus and the tour guide. She even took us to traditional tea ceremony in central Beijing which you mustn't miss. Oct 3 2009 	Horrible service... poor attitude	First, the room is ok (there is a mark on the carpet, and smells like they use perfume to cover the smell of smoke). Location good for business traveller going to Guo Mao area. Not that great for leisure traveller as it is far from all attractions. Value - ask about promotions before you book or pay. They told us it is RMB$1000/night. Only after 3 hrs, when we asked about promos, they unwillingly told us about the promo of RMB$600/night.Major problem is the attitude and service. My collegue speaks fluent mandarin so it is not language problem. We went to the front desk without reservation on the Mid Autumn festival evening after a day of working. We told them, with proofs, that we work for this company with corporate rate of $600/night. The front desk said we couldnt use the corp rate without written approval in specific form. So we asked what is the walk in rate, she said $900+charges ~= $1000. After about 5 minutes of trying, we gave up. We made many calls to different hotels and agents etc, without luck. Then after 3 hours (of calls, upset, and then working in their lobby), we went back to the front desk, this time after my coworker asked, she told us there IS a promotion for RMB$600/night for the National Day. What a shame on them and on this National Day promo. If they told us 3 hours ago, we would have checked in 3 hours earlier. If my collegue didnt ask, we would never know. What kind of 5 star hotel is this? to hide its promotions from desparate corporate traveller who frequent the hotel way too often. Aug 13 2009 	Awesome Facilities/Mediocre Service	Stayed here and the Grand Hotel which are 2 5-star hotels and completely different. The GM has awesome facilities. One of the nicest pools/workout facilities i've ever seen in a hotel. Great great rooms and washrooms, free internet through flatscreen tv's with a wireless keyboard and a great breakfast. But the service was lame and inconsistent. The concierge seemed clueless and the checkin wasn't that friendly. Also they had no control over people butting in lines and checkin and checkout and the prices for tours and assitance was at least 200RMB more than the Grand Hotel (seems excessive for almost the exact same tours) Must commend the doormen however, they were really good.Also the location is in the CBD (right beside the CCTV building), so it ends up being a little bland. But if you're just worried about faciliities, this hotel was top notch. Jul 1 2009 	Luxury in the heart of Beijing	Very spacious and luxurious rooms with huge bathrooms, found the location very convenient being next to the subway station and a few minutes taxi to the main tourist destinations. Restaurants offered a wide range of eastern and western delicacies. Great view of the CCTV building and interesting to look at the burnt down mandarin oriental hotel next to it. May 29 2009 	Posh new hotel in an increasing posh city	We stayed 4 nights at the Grand Millennium in December. My husband and I visited Beijing with his parents, and all 4 of us enjoyed our stay very much. We got a good deal as well, as many new hotels needed to boost business after the decline in visitors post-Olympics.The rooms were fairly big and the bed very comfortable. Choice of pillows available. Heating was good. Bathroom was big and well equipped with bath tub and separate shower. Staff was helpful and polite. Not much smiling though, very business like. No trouble communicating with the reception, not as easy with the restaurant staff but I could practice my Mandarin. Buffet breakfast was great except the English tea tastes a bit different. If you drink Chinese tea then it's fine. The location was perfect because it was in the heart of the financial centre, right next door to where our expat friend was living. Less than 30 min from the airport (except rush hour as the traffic in Beijing can be quite a nightmare) by taxi, which costs about 100 RMB. Since the financial district is the new trendy area, restaurants around here tend to be more expensive (100+ RMB pp) but also better quality. Try the restaurant inside the Ritan Park and the hotpot place across the road. We also tried some local dumpling places in the old city Hutongs (alleys), where the 4 of us were fed for a mere total of 15 RMB. This gives you an idea of the rich-poor gap in this city.Beijing in December was freezing (-10 oC by day) and we went everywhere in the city by taxi, which was so cheap. Tiananmen Square, Forbidden City etc all within a 30 RMB (15 min) ride. For the Olympic village we took the brand new subway line. So cheap. For the Great wall and summer palace (further out from the city), our friend arranged chauffeur service at 600 RMB for a whole day. The hotel would arrange that too, perhaps a bit more expensive. The bit of Great wall that we went to (Badaling) was very popular amongst tourist, hence with better facilities (gondolas for those who do not wish to walk, even a roller coaster for the downward trip). Our driver suggested that next time we can try the 'wild Great wall' sections - no hand rails, no staircase, no toilet, no souvenir shops, but he did not recommend that for our parents.All in all, Beijing is a city with something for everyone. From the spectacular forbidden city to the charming alleys still filled with the smell of coal, to the trendy art shops in the 798 art district. (798 used to be a weapon factory), we enjoyed our stay very much. You still see the 'flying swords' (spitting) once in while, usually by older men, but the general population are very friendly to tourists, thanks to the Olympics effect. And the Grand Millennium is a posh new hotel to explore the improving city. Mar 25 2009 	Excellent Hotel Will Return On My Next Visit	Room:What can I say! This room was new, large and luxurious! Spacious work desk (with free internet). Comfortable bed with reading light and Large LCD TV. Day bed was also provided beside the Window and gave a good view of the City. Toilet area was hugh and connected to the room (you could pull a sliding door for privacy). Separate 'Spa' Shower and WC area, also Bath Tub was located near window too.Breakfast:The breakfast room located at the ground was classy. The menu was delightful with plenty of choices. From American Breakfast of Fried Eggs, Sussages and Bacon to China Porridge to Rice Dishes to Japanese Roll to Dessert Tarts. Freshly brewed coffee was served every morning. Facilities:Excellent and large gym with excellent weights and aerobic equipment. But best of all was the 25m lap pool!Service staff:From counter staff, kitchen staff, waiting staff, front desk, bell-boys and Concerige. Excellent, Courteous and Attentive. Location:Nothing interesting nearby but there was a shopping mall within a short 5 mins walk World Trade Center was 10 mins walk and the famour Silk Plaza was around 15 mins walk. The Local Underground Transit Stop was located just outside the hotel but I did not use. Note that this hotel is just open and very new and I can detect a slight 'smell' in the hallways and pool, not so evident in the room (probably still need some airing). Nothing too offensive but definitely there. Also not all taxt will know this hotel, so do a print a copy of the Map. Mar 7 2009 	This hotel actually stinks	This supposedly 5 star hotel actually &quot;stinks&quot;. That is, there's something defective with its sewage pipes within ALL its room's washroom which makes close proximity to its toilets unbearable. On top of this, the rooms are so HOT in the winter time since there's no way of turning down the thermostat without turning off the rooms ventilation system and the windows can't be opened. And there's no air conditioning in the rooms during winter time. Which is common in Beijing hotels... I've stayed in many Beijing hotels for the past 3 years. I've actually stayed here back in Nov 2008 with the same problems but in a different room, floor and wing. At that time, I thought it was an isolated case. But, with my this current stay, the identical problems exists. I've complained on both occasions and both time, they've just sprayed freshener in the drainage and fiddled with the ventilation.. problem still persists. On top, this hotel is so new that most taxis won't know where it is so you'll have to give them specific directions.. even when I can speak Mandarin, its adds complexity on your trip. And finally, the service is pretty bad for a 5 star hotel. Had to change hotel because of the aforementioned problems in the middle of the night at 11pm and there was no doorman or bell boy in the front entrance. To add to the problem, there are very few taxis waiting in front.. mostly because few people know about this hotel.On the plus side, the hotel is new and all the rooms are nicely decorated. The hotel lobby is very grand. The breakfast buffet has a wide selection. And the price is pretty reasonable given its location and decoration. But, the smell of the washroom is a closer for me. Feb 12 2009 	Horrible service of this hotel!	Since i found this hotel from the website,and this hotel featured a lot of satisfaction i expect such as the view of the CCTV head-quarter and Mandarin Oriental hotel at the next, huge bathroom with larger bathtub.great location to access CBD which would suprise us for an enjoyable stay.But after then,we were completely disappointed not to be served by whole hotel staffs from concierge , housekeeping ,reception , bellboy or as well..here are our horrible experiences of staying this hotel from following lists:1: Once we got arrived to the hotel..the bellboy were not that friendly for our arrival ,no more smiles and sincere welcome at all.2: When we checked in to reception and required the staff to have the room which's located at the high floor and can see the view with CCTV tower and Mandarin oriental from hotel room..But the staff didn't seem understand what that meant which meant she's failed to understand what exactly required in english..and the staff have no much personality of his service attitude..no smile no warmth no team work spirit at all.3.After we checked in,and started putting the room key to activate the lift,the room key failed to activate the lift from time to time...it bothered us a lot until we came back to the reception to replace the new key.4:After we left from the elevator and walked on the way for our room...OMG..most of the decorations to the wall..floor and the ceiling was extremely boring which didn't make sense the decoration from lobby..biz centre..outside the hotel entrance.so far the carpet looked so uncomfortable that were not made by the quality material,and the room door didn't look like a hard wood which serves as a high prevention of fire hazard and sound proof,we can imagine that if there was a fire that we might get cooked.5.As the 5 stars accommondation which provides the presentable services for every guests,i was so disppointed not to be satisfied by the housekeeper,since we left out the room for sightseeing and called the housekeeping to send somebody to get out room cleaned and refreshed...once we came back to the room..omg ,the housekeeping didn't make the job done which meant they had gotten the room cleaned,but the bed seemed not be to done,they put the back pillows beside the king's size bed and didn't make it nice as well as since we came to the room,that's our the worst treatment that we ever experienced with.5,Before we checked out,i have enquired the concierge staff to show us the list which the terminal of the beijing internation airport we should be in..but they had no idea about the infortmation of the airlines where the planes land to,just gave us the airlines list without explaining the details on our inquiry.Finally,i think this hotel is absolutely not recommendbale for you to stay with for biz or leisure purposes,that's shame for the both managers managing this hotel for every customers....5-stars luxury hotel..haha ,what a shame,what a fiasco.That's all my comment of staying there.thanks for stopping by. Jan 30 2009 	New home in Beijing	Frequent visitor to Beijing ( six trips in 5 months), and I've now found my preferred hotel. Rooms are very good size, excellent bathrooms and the bed with selection of pillows is extremely comfortable. Most all the staff have good or very good English. Of particular note is the dining / breakfast room. I had perhaps one of the best simple fish/vegetables dishes ever. The Chinese food is also very good. Pool and gym facilities are first class and I even tried a basic massage in the spa - very good if a little pricey. Next return trip is February and I have no need to look anywhere else. Jan 1 2009 	A Truly Grand Hotel	This being our first time in Beijing, we had anticipated walking quite a bit touring the attractions and decided that it would be nice to come back to a nice comfortable hotel after a long day of sightseeing and shopping. On a tip from our travel agent we chose this hotel. The hotel is located in the Central Business District and about a 25 minute taxi ride from the airport. We stayed 4 days and 3 nights at this hotel and it was a wonderful experience. The decor of the lobby was modern and classy, and the staff were very helpful and accommodating right from the start. The rooms are well decorated with a flat screen tv, free internet connection, and a huge bathroom. The tub was large and ideal for soaking in a bubble bath at the end of the day. The separate shower had good space and dual shower heads. Also, the room was well stocked with some bathroom toiletries. Everything about the room was quite new and there were no signs of wear and tear at all. There was even a complimentary shoe polish service. Perhaps the one thing I would suggest would be for the hotel to get firmer mattresses for the beds and firmer pillows as well. The breakfast buffet was quite good compared to other hotel buffets that we have had with a good mixture of Asian and Western breakfast food. Perhaps because we were there in December but the breakfast dining room was never full. In fact there was one time when our party were the only guests dining in the room. The hotel is a business hotel however, we saw several families with young children there and it seems that the hotel caters well to a diverse clientèle. The exercise room is big with a juice bar, and several exercise machines. One thing that we regret was that the swimming pool was not opened due to construction. The pool's size was tremendous and it had to be one of the biggest indoor pools that I have seen in a hotel. We would certainly stay at this hotel again in future trips to Beijing if not only to be able to swim in the pool! Besides that, it boasts a good location where you can get practically anywhere by taxi or subway, and is in an area that is less touristy than other areas. Nov 18 2008 	Nice place to stay	This hotel locates outside the inner city (inner city is where the Forbidden Palace is located.), around the second ring road. However, there is a subway near by that you can take and is faster than using taxi because of heavy traffic in Beijing. But beware of high volume of bodies using the subway. There are about 16 million people living in Beijing, therefore, it can be tiring trying to fight and push your way through the train door. Since the hotel is quite new, I can smell the new paint and at times make me feel sick. The room itself is modern and very nice. Flat TV screen, free internet connection, nice bed and pillows, coffee/tea/Chinese tea are plus addition. The shower is fantastic with two shower heads jetting nice warm water. The staff is friendly and helpful. Buffet breakfast and lunch are very good with varieties of Asian and Western choices. The hotel has a nice gym and a nice-looking swimming pool. Unfortunately, the pool was not ready to use during my visit.This is a nice place to stay and I can find silence and peace after wondering through a mass of people during my sight-seeing. Nov 17 2008 	Preposterous services overall	We held a corporate event at this hotel early Nov 2008 and received preposterous services overall. 99% of the Staffs at the hotel were unable to communicate in English, they were unfriendly and unwilling to provide assistance to guests. I will not recommend anyone to use this hotel for both business and leisure purposes. Nov 13 2008	A great experience	This is a new hotel only having opened just prior to the Olympics.The staff were fabulous, polite and very willing to help and accommodate your requests.It is located within a 1 minute walk from the subway station which is part of the new line for the Olympics. The subway enables you to travel around Beijing relatively easily and cheaply.The rooms are modern, comfortable and clean.The executive lounge is pleasant and staffed by a great team of people.The hotel has a good gym and a huge indoor swimming pool. The restaurants are good, although sometimes on occasions some of the buffet food was a little dry, but the variety is good.The bar has a jazz band which can be a little noisy and overwhelming in the evenings, but is still worth a visit.Overall this is an extremely good hotel and one worth staying at as a base for a trip to and around Beijing. Aug 26 2008 	A TRUE Grand Hotel	We booked last minute to come to the Olympic, never knew or heard of this Hotel before. What a positive surprise, from the time you step into this true Grand Hotel till you leave. Everyone is sooooo friendly there, the ground floor lobby is where all the action is, a super lounge with very attentive service and a Chinese culture band… not the cheese once one would expect no really nice a pleasant to listen to. There is a Chinese restaurant with super nice food and a large designer breakfast restaurant. The bar is a little wrong and we in our group thought this should be better a sports bar or jazz..Our room was very spacious and also very modern, the location is central with a subway station 2 minutes walk, right in front of the HotelWell we want to come back next year to Beijing to do some more touristy things and definitely will stay in this Hotel again."

Check out NORRA's press release and a short video about the SRI EV1 below . NORRA ""FORGES THE FUTURE"" THIS WEEK VIA FIRST ALL-ELECTRIC OFF-ROAD RACE CAR TO CHALLENGE THE LEGENDARY BAJA PENNINSULA Since 1967, the National Off Road Racing Association's (NORRA) Mexican 1000 has been a significant environment for creativity and innovation in off-road motorsports. Thanks to the technical and industry credibility of hot rod pioneer and NORRA executive Don Francisco, the unique Baja competition quickly rose to prominence via the participation of stars like of Parnelli Jones, James Garner and Steve McQueen. Why? From its inception desert racing's wide-open environment gave the automotive industry a new forum for brilliant innovators like Vic Hickey to create the original ""Baja Boot"" and the legendary Olds 442 ""Banshee"". That unique hot rodding legacy will return in a wholly unique way as NORRA today announced the entry of the first ever all-electric off-road race car, the SRI EV1 into this week's four-day General Tire Mexican 1000 rally. The fourth annual vintage-flavored on and off-road rally is scheduled to begin on Saturday, April 27 with a pre-event technical inspection, vehicle display and driver's meeting all taking place at the historic bullring in Mexicali, Baja, Mexico. A record field of 150-plus entries (up from 95 last year) will be made up of motorcycle, truck, buggy and sedan classes from an international list of entries, with a unique emphasis on vintage machinery and a distinctive spotlight on hospitality, adventure and fun. The EV1 is a full scale, 100% electric-powered race car built to resemble a modern Class 1 unlimited open-wheel machine. Designed by SRI, SRD and EV West, the car produces 535 HP and 750 ft-lbs of torque. Power is delivered through two 9"" Netgain WarP motors controlled via Evnetics Soliton 1 high performance controllers before being delivered to the dirt via a Mendeola S4D sequential gearbox. Team SRI's goal for the 1,200-plus mile Mexican 1000 is to successfully complete all three of the Special Stages on Day 1 from the start in Mexicali to the first overnight stop at Bahia De Los Angeles before running on portions of the remaining Special Stages throughout the event that fall within the EV1's range. This includes the final ""Secret Stage"" on Day 4 that precedes the official finish line at land's end in San Jose Del Cabo. Structured in a rally format instead of the more tradition, non-stop Baja endurance competition, the NORRA Mexican 1000 offers Team SRI a unique opportunity to demonstrate the capabilities of the EV1 thanks its multi-day schedule and a series of off-road Special Stages linked via on-road transit sections. Not surprisingly, the new EV1 is a one-of-a-kind hybrid that combines proven off-road racing technology with a cutting edge drivetrain. The Brenthel Industries chassis features a ride controlled by Bilstein Black Hawk 9300 series shocks on BFG Baja TA KR 35x12.50x15 tires balanced and protected with Ride-On TPS on Method Racing Wheels. Driver and co-driver ride in MasterCraft seats and harnesses. Power for the motors is stored in 138, 3.3v 180ah China Aviation Lithium Batteries (CALB) in two ""hot swap"" battery packs each containing 69 cells. Additional power for the car's Racepak, Baja Designs lighting, communications and GPS is provided by a 4-cell battery pack located in the driver's compartment. Total energy stored in the battery packs is 82kWh, enough to power an average home for about a week. ""This is a monumental undertaking that has been 18 solid months in the making,"" explained Strategic Recovery Institute founder Jeffrey Smith. ""Our entire team is excited about what we are stepping forward to do. We are confident that our upcoming Mexican 1000 capabilities demonstration will generate future battery sponsorship to allow the ability to 'hot swap' multiple battery packs andcomplete entire races in the near future."" The unique legacy of the General Tire NORRA Mexican 1000 to motivate and inspire is still alive and well. Like the unique mid-engine four-wheel drive Baja Boot that Vic Hickey built in the 30 days prior to the inaugural NORRA Mexican 1000 in 1967, the SRI EV1 will become living proof that innovation with an eye toward the future is a powerful concept that may never become obsolete. # # # ABOUT THE GENERAL TIRE NORRA MEXICAN 1000 Dubbed the ""Happiest Race on Earth,"" the unique off-road rally was co-created by promoter Mike Pearlman in 2010. Running this year from April 26 - May 1, each day of the rally consists of special stages (unlimited speed timed stages in the dirt) linked together by controlled speed liaison / transit sections (highway). The one-of-a-kind, once-a-year, four-day rally includes vintage off-road vehicles and motorcycles, rally cars, a limited group of modern desert racecars and classes for prerunner trucks and buggies. Pearlman's late father Ed and others established the first running of the NORRA Mexican 1000 off-road rally in November of 1967, which eventually became internationally recognized and evolved into the Baja 1000 in the mid-1970s. The NORRA Mexican 1000 is supported by General Tire, American Racing Wheel, South Point Hotel Casino, Walker Evans Racing, Azunia Tequila, KC HiLites, Bistein Shock Absorbers and Mastercraft/I mpact Safety. baja , baja 1000 , electric car , electric vehicle , ev , general tire mexican 1000 , national off road racing association , norra , off-road , rally , sr1 ChooseControl: Find Your Dream Car *0 / 3000 Character Maximum 0:43 - ""...You step on the gas...""...err....juice? 21 hours ago Report abuse Permalink Yesterday at 7:16 PM Report abuse Permalink 1 reply to HVH20's comment It was fabricated by SRD (Strategic Racing Designs), with from EV West, for SRI (Strategic Recovery Institute).

Really curious to know how they are gonna charge it out in the middle of nowhere with no nearby plug. They would have to haul a huge solar array, or maybe a portable generator.

"Apr 3 2009	Terrible hotel terrible staff	Stayed at Grand View Garden Hotel end of March with family. At first the hotel appeared to be clean but on inspection bathrooms were not cleansed properly, hair was evident from the previous customer. Breakfast was a lovely if you were allowed in breakfast area. With the excuse of a full breakfast area ( even though room would not be half filled). Every morning the hotel staff would send asian origin customers to an alternate breakfast area at the back of the hotel where it was cold, little choice of food and lack of staff and no cuttery avaliable. Western customers were allowed to enter the main breakfast area even though I was told prior to them that the room was full. When asked for an explanation, the hotel staff (Jenny) ignored me and pretended that she did not understand, waving her hand to gesture me to leave. Overall very dissappointed with this hotel and never stay there again. Nov 2 2008	A reasonable hotel	You might end up staying here if you book the 3 star tour with Wendy wu, The hotel does all the important stuff well - rooms are clean and food okay. It could be better with a little more attention to detail - the bathrooms are a little tatty and i spotted the odd loose telephone wire. I agree the Internet cost is high. I though that the business services secretary would have a better command of English than the chinese average but this did not prove to be the case - i am not sure how she would have coped with typing up a letter or two. Oct 29 2008	Average accommodation overpriced extras	Stayed 3 nights with a tour group. Was tour group standard. Rooms OK, Breakfast OK. Even though inside city moat, too far from anywhere.Ridiculously high prices in Hotel Bar (ie bottle of beer in bar was 15times local store price and 4 times local restaurant price)Also they wanted 1.8yuan PER MINUTE of internet access. Found local internet bar for 3yuan per hour. Sep 22 2008 	Paralympic Visit 2008	The hotel was everything we expected and more. I stayed at the hotel with my son for 10 days, supporting Hazel Simpson, paralympic athlete. One minor problem with the bathroom (small overnight flood), but this was dealt with immediately with no inconvenience to ourselves. Food (breakfast only for us) was everything we expected. Staff were always helpful and curtious. Barstaff always beautifully uniformed and professional. Soft furnishings in public areas were in good condition. Carpets appeared new throughout the hotel. General hotel cleanliness was excellent. Housekeeping and room cleaning was 100%. Room security - I accidently forgot to lock the Safe one day in a rush to get to The Birds Nest Stadium, - management reset and locked the Safe, and the room-maid &quot;camped out&quot; outside the room to tell us when we returned, - you could't have asked for more. Aug 26 2008 	grand view garden hotel Beijing	Stayed in this hotel with my husband and 2 children as the start of our china holiday tour,we had previously spent 3 nights in the holiday inn central. The Grand view was not a very nice place to stay not only was the carpet stained all over the hotel it was also very run down. The hotel room was dirty the bathroom had mold growing in the sealant and black hair on the shower wall, the mini bar was empty even though we had paid a deposit for it and it took 2 days for them to fill it ! We had booked an interconnecting room but instead we had rooms down the corridor from each other and they would not change them and could not speak english when we tried to sort it out. The hotel boasts a bowling alley but that was dismantled years ago and the night club is more like private rooms for karaoke ! The food at the hotel was average even the chinese food was average let alone the american. When we left we had bites around our ankles ( not very nice)Overall i would not stay here again, i would stay at the holiday inn central Beijing which was wonderful Dec 12 2007	A pleasant hotel but remote from main sites	Stayed in this hotel as part of a Wendy Wu tour. It was a very pleasant low rise hotel. The rooms were warm, clean and comfortable. The bathroom was a bit worn and the shower rather feeble. Breakfast was very good as long as you got there fairly early. The hotel is a long way out from the city centre and not near a subway either. However, taxis are cheap. There is a supermarket nearby (out of hotel turn right and then turn left at the KFC and it is on the left.)There is a nice park next to the hotel with free entry for hotel residents.Internet is very expensive at the business centre 1.8 yuan a minute, but if you go down to the gym in the basement you can use the internet for free (it is slow though) and get a free gift too!!If like us you finish up your tour here and are flying home with BA, you can check in on-line and book your seats, you just can't print your boarding pass. This does'nt matter as they check you in at the airport. Oct 5 2007	Nice Hotel	A lovely hotel, very comfortable rooms - ours had an outlook of the courtyard and others in our group looked out into the gardens. Beds were the most comfortable of the trip. Breakfasts were very busy and staff were not able to keep up with the needs of the customers, the coffee machine broke down every day and we always had to go in search of cutlery and napkins. Food served was nice though and the 'egg chef' cooked a mean omlette. We were able to check in early which was a nice touch having just gotten off the train from Xi'an (11 hours) and able to freshen up and eat breakfast. Check out was a nightmare, very disorganised. Our tour guide received a phone call advising of all sorts of issues after check out such as missing keys and unpaid bills - everyone had paid and returned their keys the hotel just had no idea what was going on. Plus, the most disappointing thing was that there was no complimentary bottled water (as promised by the tour guide/operator) - we had to pay 8 yuan a bottle (special price). This was the only hotel on the tour where this occurred and it was supposed to be a 4 star hotel. Sep 12 2007	good hotel bad location	stayed here for 3 nights as part of our kuoni tour - gorges of the yangtze.we were met at the airport by our tour manager Hong (who was excellent) and transfered to the hotel within 90 mins.this hotel is in the middle of nowhere so if you are not on an escorted tour i would stay away as there are no attractions within walking distance.the rooms were of a good size and clean . the buffet breakfast and restaurants were very good although the bar let the place down.only 2 draught beers and the decor was dull and outdated.our excursions included tiananmen square,the forbidden city,great wall(mutianyu section),summer palace and the temple of heaven.we arrived at the wall at 10.00 and had 2 hours to ourselves. it was very hot but not overcrowded.i would not advise arriving at midday with babies as some people did. the cablecar saved the legs and time.the walk around tiananmen square was very thought provoking.there are a few buildings closed in the forbidden city (including the palace of supreme harmony) but as there are so many others this did not detract from the visit.the kung fu show at the red theatre is worth a look. the hotel staff were polite and helpful. overall an enjoyable stay in beijing. Aug 19 2007 	Perfectly adequate.	We stayed here as part of our Kuoni tour, China Highlights. Perfectly adequate hotel with a good breakfast. The breakfast rooms tend to be busy as everyone wants to leave at the same time but it's not a problem.The swimming pool is around the back and changing rooms are in desperate need of renovation but apart from that no complaints.Garden at the back is well worth a visit after breakfast.It is some distance from the attractions so if you are not on a tour this might be a problem for you but it was fine for us. Jun 23 2007 	Not bad	Clean, tidy hotel but stuck out in the middle of nowhere. Some 'gardens' out the back of the hotel (reached through the hotel, follow the signs), entrance for the public is up the road and they have to pay. A few drinking establishments located outside by the more adventurous in our group and also a couple of restaurants, not much else.Standard rooms adequate, miniscule bathroom with thin towels which did not get you dry but well enough equipped. We opened our curtains to find the biggest satellite dish in the Guiness Book of Records! Ghastly, no wonder the curtains were closed when we arrived in the middle of the day. Buffet breakfast was fine, taken in 1 of 2 rooms. A staff member will indicate which one you should use with a grunt and a toss of her head. Didn't eat anything else there so no idea of standard. Waitresses looked bored and tired though not impolite particularly, didn't take much notice of the customers just cleared the tables. Find own table, bit of a scrum and you share with anyone/everyone else. Take something to leave on the chair when you've bagged your seat or someone else will sit there while you're getting your brekky!On an organised tour so trips out were arranged already, if DiY I wouldn't stay here - uninteresting outside and location pretty much rubbish. All in all a fairly mediocre hotel, neither good nor bad, doesn't really stand in any area really. Jun 10 2007	Adequate Accommodation	We stayed at Grand View Garden Hotel in Beijing as part of our 14 days group tour of China in May from Alberta, Canada. We stayed on the 2nd floor and the renovated hotel rooms had met our travel expectations: clean room, clean bathroom, hot shower, and working air conditioning. The rooms were small and the lighting was dim. Hotel staff did not have good command of spoken English, but it did not create a big problem for us. ATM machine was available in the hotel lobby.The quality of the Western and Chinese buffet breakfast was average. Grand View Garden is a Chinese style hotel located in a typical Beijing neighbourhood on Nan Cai Yuan Street. There are shops and restaurants along the street. I don't believe there are any hotels in Beijing, a city of 16 millions people, that is within walking distance to tourist attractions. Traffic conjestion is a daily reality in any major Chinese city including Beijing. Taxi fare is cheap; the most we paid for a taxi ride in China was 26 RMB, which was less than $4.00 Canadian. Behind the hotel is the famous Chinese garden, Daguanyuan, based on the Chinese classic &quot;The Dream of the Red Mansion,&quot; and entrance fee for hotel guests is free. It was very relaxing to visit the garden in the morning watching groups of local Chinese doing their tai chi and exercise routine. This hotel is pretty good value for someone who wants to be a traveller in China. If you want to be a typical Western tourist, look for an American style hotel in Beijing. May 13 2007 	Good Hotel	Must have stayed in a different hotel from the last review. We were here as part of a Kuoni tour and we were delighted with this hotel. Our room had recently been refurbished and was lovely with even a drinking water tap. Very clean and comfortable and a good size The garden was fantastic - really peaceful when you think you are in the middle of Beijing. The breakfast was excellent with a bril choice of either western of chinese food Apr 28 2007 	Don't go there...	Me and my girlfriend stayed here for 4 days in the start of April, 2007. The hotel is nice-looking, but have some major flaws. First, the hotel is situated a long way from the - ANY attractions, and so therefore you will have to grab a cab, which is no problem. But in a city like Beijing with heavy traffic problems during rush hour, it will take you a long time to get just a few km away from Grand View Garden Hotel. Don't go here if you just NEED to have an english or western-like breakfast - the one at the hotel is absolutely terrible! And VERY, VERY expensive! I believe we payed 135 RMB for the two of us for 1 meal...! The food was cold, and probably not made today - only a few hundred metres north of the hotel is a little 'shop', selling some kind of pancake (chinese fastfood) out the window, which is very good. 2 RMB... Furthermore, we weren't lucky with our room, which had a GRAND view to a giant satellite dish - and the tone in the windows made the room where dark, I guess we would just have loved to wake up with the sun in our eyes. On the other hand, the bathroom was fine, fine and there was always hot water available for making your own tea.At last, the receptionists were indeed not very good at their job; not very helpful, not very good at english or worldwide finger alphabet, and, some of them, rather arrogant. We never got to try the hotels swimmingpool. Our advice: Do not choose this hotel if you're in Beijing on a tourists holiday, but it might be okay if you're there on business - still you will have to order breakfast from outside, though... Apr 15 2007 	Would not stay again	I was not impressed. A big difference from the BP International in Hong Kong. Front desk female was combative and rude to our travel agent; very few of the employees seemed happy to work there. Saw a couple of employee arguments during our stay.We arrived with 3 rooms, 2 of which smelled of smoke and mildew. We asked to be moved; got a promise that they would fix the smell, and sent a guy to spray the Chinese version of glade air freshener.We asked to have at least two of the rooms close together (for our kids to stay), and were told that they could not do this. So, our rooms were 1208, 1223, and 1265. Thanks.The meals were not good. There's a few different resturants; but they open up at least 2 for breakfast. I found the meals to be poor - the danishes were at least 2 days old; very stale. Juice despensers were leaky...all of it was unappetizing.We ate dinner once...and that was enough. For $20 bucks a head, we were treated to a buffet that included flat warm beer, cold egg drop soup, and other un-appetizing dishes. All while the help scowled at us and informed us that they were going to close so we'd better hurry up.They do have a shop with a tailor and some food and trinkets. We never tried the pool based on the condition of the resturant and rooms - my guess is that it wasn't very clean but we didn't have the time to find out. The one helpful person was the female night manager - helped us out with shopping locations.All in all, a poor location (takes about 30 minutes more to get anywhere since its south of the city), unclean hotel with unhappy staff. We would have moved out but our schedule was too busy to deal with the hassel. Feb 14 2007	No Complaints	We stayed at this hotel for 3 nighs hotel as part of a tour. We were happy with this hotel. The rooms were clean and the staff were friendly. And the garden was very relaxing which is hard to do in Beijing. The hotel has a definite Chinese feel so if you are looking for Hilton or Sheraton, keep looking. Nov 12 2006	Not a delux but a comfortable hotel	The hotel is not a surprise to us after reading all the reviews. We found it clean although there is a type of odor in the bathroom which we found not very pleasant. As one poster says, the room has a minimum of bedding/sheets; we found it a bit too hot with only the duvet available as blanket. The shower in the bathroom is comletely pathetic - with water just triggled down! Another thing that pissed us off is - our room was in the non-smoking floor (since we specifically asked for it), and yet a neighboring room had a guest smoking openly with his door wide open - so that the stinky smoke spilled all into the hallway. we figured we would not have got any results if we did complain, so we did not.What we found quite unique is the garden and the classical story behind it. It would have been much beautiful had we been there say, a month earlier. We were surprised to find that the Grand View garden is also rated as one of the top 40 tourist site in China. We do not mind going back (since the price is right) - except that we would check the shower first before accepting the room. Nov 6 2006	Affordable Luxury	The hotel is located south-west of the Forbidden Palace and on the 3rd inner ring road. Locatioins to most tourist attractions are within 10-30 minutes away by mini-buses (private).The facilities and staff friendliness is a very welcoming experience. Cleanliness is above average. Although the staffs don't speak fluent English (we know they are trying very hard), their warmth and smily faces is enough to tell what they're trying to say, although not all the time when you need a translator.I would go back to this place again in near future. I have not regretted living here as it has offered me a memorable experience. Oct 19 2006 	A lot more than an acceptable hotel	We stayed here on a tour for 3 nights. The first impression is good of the Chinese architecture style that the hotel has been built in. Once inside the lobby is impressive, with a large marble staircase up to function rooms, a piano which is played in the evening and another seating area. The check in was efficient, with two sections to check in and a separate area to change money with the exchange rates posted on the wall, we didn't change money here but they were happy to change a 100Y note to smaller notes. There are seats to relax in the lobby, which also has a shop selling Olympic merchandise, which leads through to more shops, selling arts and crafts and a convenience shop with food and drink.Off the lobby is a bar, further down the corridor are 3 restaurants, 1 Western, which was very good, unless a tour party had arrived it was never busy, only a handful of people, even if there was a tour in, it didn't bother the a la carte diners, most dishes seemed to be between 30-100 Yuan. The next restaurant was advertising Abalone and Sharks Fin soup, it seemed to be incredible expensive, but I may have misunderstood. The last restaurant I think was BBQ style with an area in the centre of the restaurant where the food was being cooked.Breakfast was the best we had in China, a good selection of cereals, milk, yoghurt, 4 fruit juices, breads, lovely small danish pastries, plenty of cooked items, bacon, sausage etc, there was a chef cooking eggs fresh each morning, obviously there was also chinese breakfast items. There are 3 rooms for breakfast, which double as the reataurants, these can get busy when everyone is trying to get out for the same time.The room was a good size, we had a twin with 2 double beds, which we comfortable, not hard like most chinese beds, nice linens on the beds, 2 easy chairs, table, TV with english language news channel, and a writing area. The bathroom was fine with a good selection of soaps etc. There was an in room safe, kettle and tea. The mini bar was empty, but was cold so you could keep your water cool, when we checked in we were asked if we wanted the minibar filled.The pool is accessed throught the BBQ style restaurant? I know strange, the pool its self was fine,a decent size, the water was cold, which seems to be the norm for China. Sadly the changing area was shocking, tiny, lockers broken, floor soaking wet, unbelievable really, also you will need a swimming cap which are on sale for 30Yuan, a bit steep as everything else in the country is cheap!The hotel is South West from the center of Beijing, it is not near the underground, we never had a problem hailing a taxi from outside of the hotel, it was less than 20Yuan to Tiananmen Sq and 28Yuan to the Back Sea Bar area. The hotel isn't exactly central, but wherever you stay you will no doubt need to take a taxi somewhere. Sorry didn't take any pictures of the rooms, kept meaning to take them when the room was tidy! and slept in on the last morning Aug 23 2006 	A clean hotel with a good range of facilities	After reading some of the reviews of this hotel I was pleasantly surprised by what I found. Our room was clean, comfortable and well-provided with the expected facilities. Breakfast was good with a wide choice of foods for every taste. Staff were helpful and polite. There is a large park at the rear which was pleasant to walk around in the late afternoon or early morning. Jun 25 2006	Not too bad	Stayed here for 3 nights while taking an organized tour in China. Not a hotel I would choose myself.It probably was a luxery hotel in the 80's but it is now behind on renovation. Although everything you expect from a 4 or 5 star hotel is here, it is looking a bit old and outdated.Minibar was completely empty and after asking it was filled. The room was very difficult to find. The hotel looks like a big mase.Breakfast was horrible. Alhough it states that they serve continental and American breakfast, this is not something I would pay for myself.The staff in the hotel bar was not nice and not like seen in other places in China. Drinks were overpriced for Chinese hotel average.Breakfast bread tastes like it has no salt, orange juice is water with a flavour, you need to find your croissant with a magnifying glass, and the breakfast area is not big enough to accommodate that many tourists that need to eat their breakfast at the same time.Their are some chinese restaurants, a KFC, a big chinese supermarket and a pharmacy in the neighbourhood. But apart from that this is a boring place. None of Beiings tourist locations are nearby. So unless you like a boring place or are only here to sleep, skip this hotel. Jun 5 2006	Boring and a bit worn	This hotel is situated in the south western part of Beijing; far from everything. Contrary to many other hotels in China, this hotel has been built with very few floors, but very many rooms on each floor. It can be a bit hard to memorize the route to and from your room the first night or two.The room I had (2157) was large, but looked a bit &quot;worn&quot; - especially in the bathroom. Although the bath was clean and tidy, there was the odd brown spots here and there. The room was quiet. Very little outside noise from other guests.The hotel service was good and efficient, and the breakfast restaurant had a great selection of various kinds of food and drink, that should cater for most tastes. Even cold milk was available.The bar and the small hotel shop catered for most needs, when in the hotel. The hotel has ATM for Visa and MasterCard and others. Lobby is large. Internet was not tested. As in most chinese hotels, you can use both european and australasia connectors for 220V 50 Hz.Even if you're not looking for &quot;nightly excitement&quot;, the hotel is boring. Good quality boredom, alas...If you're looking for a hotel room only needed for sleeping, this is as good as any. Otherwise pick something else. Here you're not even taking a nightly stroll outside. There's &quot;nothing&quot; in the neighbourhood. May 4 2006	Not Impressed!	When i arrived and went to my room i was horrified! The smell of the room was horrible, we had the kitchens right below us, all of the furniture in the room i.e. the tables and chairs were on top of the bed, there was chewing gum stuck on the bathroom side, the window was so dirty you could hardly see out of it, and the view that i had was a huge satelite dish that covered the whole window, not so grand! I went straight down to reception and asked to be moved, and we were within an hour, the next room was ok, smelt a lot fresher and was overall a lot nicer. The breakfast was ok, apart from if you go down at a busy time you have to sit on a large round table and share with other people, didn't like that so much, and this hotel is every much out of the way, i felt like i was the only english person in beijing when i went for a walk down the road to the supermarket. Would rush back in a hurry! Apr 8 2006 	Ok except for the location	I spent 5 weeks at this hotel. While the room rate is more than acceptable at less than RMB 400 its location leaves much to be desired. You will have to take a taxi to go anywhere. And there is very little of interest in the nearby streets. There are more local people than foreign tourists staying at this hotel. The foreigners are mostly people travelling in groups.There is little as far as entertainment in the hotel except for the ubiquitous bowling alley. It was often deserted and I usually played by myself. At least the hotel was very quiet.And beware that the staff does not speak English. This hotel might not be ideal for tourists. Jan 8 2006	I would stay again	Stayed 7 days here while touring Beijing. Rooms were small, clean, and comfortable. The staff was very accomidating. Laundry was quick and cheap. The hotel has a bit of a tradional flair, which I liked. It may be a little out of the way, but I preferred that as well. Anyway, a taxi is cheap, and we spent most of our time getting around that way. The breakfast buffet was convenient but average, but at least they had good coffee. Had dinner only once in the hotel, and it was also average and relatively expensive. There are too many places to explore and eat than to eat in the hotel anyway. There was a small grungy cafe just down the street that had great food. They will throw live shrimp in your face before they cook them so be prepared. Jul 27 2005	Lovely Garden within hotel	We stayed in this hotel for 3 nights in June. The hotel has a choice of 3 restaurants which are expectedly more pricey but affordable than say restaurants outside. In the basements there are a disco, snooker table and bowling alley which I believe are free for staying guest. Rooms are adequate and comfortable and there is a safe in the room which is not firmly attached to the wall - so beware !!Within the hotel there is an access to garden which is amazingly beautiful but door from the hotel closes around 3pm. Non staying guests will only have access through the main gate of the garden which you have to pay entrance fee. Location of the hotel is on a side street with not much to see, apart from 1 or two restaurants. Its very old and dusty and not much to do unless you take a taxi. Hotel itself is ok but I would not recommend this hotel based on location( although the hotel is quite popular for holding special events). At the time we were there, there was a special conference for the China Olympics. Jul 13 2009 	??????????? Jul 12 2006	risque de poste restante"
"Nov 24 2009	Could be better	I agree with Kittyhead, the main interest is: It's close to Tienanmen Square &amp; the Forbidden City.My opinion about this hotel is a bit so-so, it's a good hotel, lot of services, nothing really bad but it could be more confortable and clean.People are nice, nothing to say about that. We were unlucky because first night was very noisy in the next room, but other nights were fines.Anyway, we were happy to found rooms here and it's close to shops, restaurants, etc.. Sep 4 2008 	Don't mind staying here again.	I booked the room via www.ctrip.com for CNY368, comes with complimentary internet access with no breakfast. I choose a superior business room with river view. LOCATION: 10 minutes walk from Beijing Pedestrian Road. Lots of convenience stores, restaurants, street food, massage/spa, night market, bars, pubs nearby. You have to walk a bit though. There is a 24 hours McDonalds right opposite the hotel. The building itself is also connected to a shopping complex. Sunway and taxis are easily available. ROOM: Newly renovated. It is simple yet give a modern kind of look. Toilet is clean. Towels are clean and basic amenities are provided. INTERNET: Complimentary WIFI. Connection speed is fast.Overall, it was quite a good stay. The hotel itself is an old building. With the renovated superior business room, I will stay here again for the location and complimentary WIFI. Oct 7 2007 	Filthy hotel with high prices	This hotel was filthy especially the carpets. I changed rooms 3 times trying to find a clean one but they were all equally disgusting ... Jun 28 2007 	Guangzhou - a great 4* hotel	We found this to be reasonable 4 star hotel with a great location. I did not find it nearly as run down as I have read in other reviews!Breakfast was average (mix of Chinese and Western). My Dad was thrilled that they have someone cooking your eggs as you like them in the morning.The rooms were clean and huge.We had a private tour guide for most of the trip so did not converse much with hotel staff. When we did their English was average. I understand that 3 star hotel's staff speak practically no English and that those at 5 star hotels are mostly fluent - so keep that in mind when booking your hotels!After a couple of nights in Beijing we went to Xi’an (staying at the Bell Tower, another great 4 star hotel) and on our departure from China we had an additional night in Beijing at the Novotel Xinqiao (which our guide informed us is of a nicer standard than the Novotel Peace for those tossing up the two) - and personally I would choose the Guangzhou again just because it has a great central location.I think considering we stayed here at Chinese New Year, the noise could have been a lot worse. I did think that it was very central and we were able to walk to Tianamen Square etc, and some intensive shopping is practically on your door step.I suggest you buy your own bottled water, you can do this just outside the hotel very cheaply. As someone else said, the water at this hotel is not complimentary and it is NOT safe to drink tap water.Really happy with my stay here and would go back again.. May 7 2007 	Great start to first time in Beijing	The hotel was booked as part of a package deal. We were in a double room for 3 nights. We didn't use all the hotel's facilities as we were out visiting sites most of the time. Buffet breakfasts were a great start to the days sight seeing. Not everyone spoke English but there was always someone who could - staff were very helpful.It is located in an area busy with people and shops nearby. Oct 8 2006 	not the romantic getaway we were looking for	My husband and I had been apart for 3 months and so I was very keen to have a nice relaxing hassle-free holiday, and despite asking my travel agent to find me an alternative hotel ( after reading everyone's comments on here), she insisted that this was a wonderful hotel etc etc etc, and that it would be perfect for us. Taking her word for it (foolishly!), I turned up at the hotel ahead of my husband who was coming in on a later flight. I was greeted by a very rude man at the main desk who insisted that I pay 500USD up front for the minibar. He was rude when I queried the charge, and laughed at me when I asked to speak to someone who could answer my questions.That was just the start of our problems:* I was given a basic twin room, instead of a double as i had booked.* The staff had VERY limited English and anything we ordered had to be re-ordered and hand signals used.* when my husband arrived later he was told that there was no-one boked into the hotel with my name* we were eventually given a room with a double bed (which was appreciated), but it overlooked a very busy mall-area which played loud music from 6.30am until late, had a sink that wouldn't drain and a safe that kept malfunctioning.* the room was a good size, but not cleaned adequately. It was not vacuumed once in the 7days we were there, and there was rubbish under the units and bed that were there from previous clients. There were stains on the carpet and the wallpaper was peeling.* the breakfast selection was fine, but the food was cold.There were positives though. * The hotel was centrally located and close to the subway. Only 1 stop to Tienamen square, 3 stops to Wangfujing shopping area, and about 6 stops to the Yongangli Silk Market.* several staff members were very helpful Jul 15 2006	Distinctly average	I stayed at the Guangzhou during March as part of a tour of China. First of all, anywhere you travel within China you will experience language difficulties if you don't speak Chinese! We had a tour guide and friends in Beijing who helped us out enormously with translations. Some of the reception staff at the Guangzhou did not speak much English although there were one or two staff members whose English was better, and when we had problems we had to wait for those staff to serve us so that we could make sure we were understood. The rooms were spacious, but I agree with some of the other reviews in that they are somewhat 'tired'. The carpet was stained in places and the room we were given (although a non-smoking room) smelt very strongly of cigarettes. We asked to see another room, but this room had the same cigarette odour too - so we stuck to the original room and left the window open all day which did improve things. The cleaners tried to help by spraying large amounts of scented air freshener in the room, but all this did was disguise the smell for a short time, and it did not eliminate it. The beds in hotel rooms in China are quite firm (apparently that's what the Chinese prefer), but we, as westerners, found them a bit too firm. The bathroom was pretty good and the hotel also provided dressing gowns, slippers and the usual complimentary toiletries. The breakfast selection was quite good and the porters and restaurant staff were efficient.Overall the hotel was good value. Jun 9 2006	Probably not the best hotel option in Beijing...	Obviously the #1 feature of Guangzhou Hotel is its prime location. As mentioned in the other reviews, it is close to the subway, Tianeman Square, Forbidden Palace, and all types of shopping. The rooms are spacious and the bathroom was clean but the carpet was stained and very run down (they included complimentary slippers which helped). The bed linens were also of low quality (or perhaps very old) and pilled. The rooms overall looked worn down and are in need of refurbishing.The included breakfasts are great with good quality food and a range of European/American/Chinese brekafast options.Now for the &quot;not so good&quot; things. This was the only hotel we stayed at in China (we stayed at 3 in total) that did not provide complimentary bottled water. We asked the staff if we could drink the water from the tap but since they spoke very little or no english they couldn't understand what we were asking. We ended up going to a grocery store and buying bottled water for ourselves. This hotel was also the most difficult to get internet access. There was (expensive 15 RMB for first 10 minutes and 0.5 RMB for every minute after) internet in the rooms but when we tried to connect to write some emails my computer (a Mac ibook) could not connect to the server. We looked into using the internet at the business center but found that even more expensive (2 RMB/minute)! After complaining through an interpreter we managed to get the room rates for the business center access but it wasn't easy. Internet access is a big deal for me so I would find another hotel with better internet access even if the location or quality was slightly worse. The lack of english really makes like difficult in a hotel. It is hard to get them to tell your taxi driver where to go. Usually there are some tour guides in the lobby in the mornings and I would recommend asking one of them to act as an interpreter if you are having difficulty.Overall I think Guangzhou is in need of a renovation and modernization. The location is nice but for the prices I see listed on other websites I think a better option could be found. Mar 2 2006	Decent Hotel	The hotel was well maintained. It is very near to the subway. The staff was very courteous, but nobody could speak English. Jan 9 2006	Nice hotel in Beijing	The Guangzhou is a great place to stay. It's convenient; it's a 15-20 minute walk to Tienanmen Square &amp; the Forbidden City and along the Xidan shopping area.The hotel is also very clean &amp; comfortable with great breakfasts. Highly recommended. Nov 8 2005	Good choice	My family and I stayed at the Guangzhou in October 2005. It lived up to its 4 star rating. It was clean and comfortable and the staff were friendly and helpful. We would stay there again. Jan 8 2009 	?????"
"Sep 18 2007 	The best and the worst	A charming traditional courtyard hotel in a central location. The dark side is getting the choice of room right. The smaller rooms are relatively cheap - about 600RMB, but they are not for the faint hearted: smelly drains, basic shower onto the floor in the bathroom, window open and insecure or locked shut - no security grill, plaster dropping from the walls, little storage space (no wardrobe). We started with 3 beds in the room, but there was literally no room to walk! One of the staff has basic English, but if she is not on shift, it's sign language.After unpacking, and discovering the room's hidden problems, we asked to move another room. We were shown a delightful courtyard suite at a much higher rate - 1200RMB. We were told we could move the next day which we did, but we are pretty sure it was vacant at the time. So - all the preliminaries were rather unpleasant.Having got to the courtyard suite, we were extremely happy, as this was very well equipped, two large bedrooms, large sitting room, all with airconditioning and TV, a nice bathroom, and a water cooler. Outside each of 3 suites look onto a lovely courtyard with a delightful water feature. You feel as if you are staying as you might have hundreds of years ago, and you are so deep in the Hutong, there is almost no noise, and you are still close to many attractions. Overall a great place to stay.For others intending to come here, check the room before you pay, and before you move in so you can jump to plan B, if your first choice isn't what you want for the price.It seems little has changed from other reviewers a year ago. Apr 24 2007 	Basic with Great Location	Originally I tried to book at the Bamboo Garden Hotel, based on the great reviews in Trip Advisor, but it was full so the extremely helpful woman, Wendy, at the Bamboo Garden made a reservation for me at Hebei Hotel. Before arriving Wendy &amp; the people at Hebei were very helpful in assisting me to book a car/driver &amp; guide and a car from the airport. They were not very expensive &amp; I would suggest doing this as the hotel is not that easy to find.This is what they call a Courtyard Hotel &amp; is down a Hutong (narrow lane in a local neighborhood). When we turned off the main road into the Hutong, I got very nervous as this was more local than I had imagined. But when we pulled into the driveway we were pleasantly surprised. This is definitely NOT a 4 or 5 star hotel, it is basic and functional and in a great location. The desk staff speaks limited English, but were extremely helpful and freindly. The room (standard size) was small for 3 of us with the extra bed, but we didn't spend much time there so it didn't matter. The room could use a coat of paint &amp; the shower has no walls, it's just part of the bathroom. I would ask for a room away from the parking area and front desk, 2nd floor would be ideal. Being in a neighborhood you do not get traffic noise or construction noise (both things I'd been warned about in Beijing). We looked into one of the larger rooms (a suite I think) &amp; it was very nice &amp; huge and more recently renovated, so if you might want to upgrade to a better room.The streets around the hotel are narrow and local. It is an easy walk to the main street which is not a far walk from Jing Shan Park, Bei Hai Park or Hou Hai (lots of bars &amp; restaurants). It actually would not be too far to the back entrance of the Forbidden City. If you take a taxi, have them drop you off on the main street &amp; walk the Hutong into the hotel, as we got caught in traffic along the Hutong that held us up probably 20 minutes. The people along the Hutong are extremely friendly and helpful. We found all of Beijing to be this way.There is breakfast, but it is Chinese, although you can get eggs &amp; the oatmeal is made with coconut milk &amp; very thin. I would suggest getting a guide &amp; car to visit the Great Wall &amp; actually we ended up using one the entire 3 days we were there. It is not that expensive &amp; definitely helps you maximize your time. Traffic in Beijing is terrible &amp; the hotel is not near an underground station. Again, this is a basic hotel in a great location. You will get the feel of old Beijing &amp; how the local people live. It was charming, but simple. We enjoyed our stay very much. Oct 16 2006 	Great location neglected hotel	Just came back for a 3 day stay in the Hebei Guest House.The location is indeed very good! Tucked away in an old Hutong (old part with small meandering alleyways) and difficult to find, the surroundings are definetly charming and much more authentic than in any other 5 star chain hotel. Within walking distance you find the Forbidden City, TianAnMen Square, WangFuJin and the Houhai Bar area.The hotel has three buildings. The rooms in the two newer buildings have virtually no old charme and go for around 350 RMB and 650 RMB. In the back of the newer buildings are two lovely courtyards and several suite type of rooms are opening up to it. These rooms are significatly more expensive, the rack rate is about 1200 RMB and 2100 RMB, but I reckon there is some room for negotiations.We were a group of 5, and booked a triple and a double. When I made the reservation I was recomended to take the 650 RMB room, since it would be more spacious and sufficient and convenient for the triple. However when we were shown to our rooms, they were very small and in the triple a very uncomfortable cot had been squeezed between two single beds. After that unfortunately no space was left for 3 people to stand in the room not to mention to put the bags somewhere.About one meter in front of the windows was a several meters high concrete wall, so the rooms were very dark, disgustingly smelly and the plaster came down the walls. The room was dusty and grim, black undefinable stuff was stuck on the floor under the sink in the bathroom and the toilet was broken. When I asked to see another room they showed me some sort of suite with a bed with a golden/ light green headpiece which had a big grey stain where obviously people usually lay their head...The hotel could be very nice with it's location and old buildings, but it is not only overpriced but unfortunatley totaly neglected and has just not the right value for this kind of money. I had the impression the owner sees the opportunity to make a fast buck with all the tourists wanting to stay in an old fashioned Courtyard Hotel. The rooms urgently need to be cleaned properly, a facelift and some renovation. Broken things were just not fixed or only very provisonal and amateurish.The place does have a lot potential, a shame that it hasn't the right owner who appreciates it. Sep 16 2006 	Comfortable clean and great location	We booked two rooms for our party of 5. We wanted reasonably priced lodging that would give us an Asian feel, rather than a Western feel. We also wanted a location within walking distance of the Forbidden City and Tien. Square. The Hebei Guest House was clean and comfortable. The staff were polite and helpful. Although they spoke some English we had a fluent Chinese speaker in our party and so did not do any communicating in English. They are happy to arrange airport or other transportation for you, but the price is much higher than if you made your own arrangements with one of the abundant cab drivers on the street. The guest house is in a traditional hutung neighborhood which is enjoyable to walk through on the way back after a busy, noisy day in the city. I would stay there again and recommend it highly."
"Oct 14 2009 	I love the hotel	Now I'm living in this hotel nearly three weeks . I feel it is a good place if your take your leisure trip. It provides good service , delicious food, nice toom, especially the convenient traffic. If you are a tourist, there are many traffic tools you can choose to get to your destination. At last, I have to mention that my friends Grace recommends me the hotel. The hotel make my tour much more colourful .Here, Thanks her a lot. Oct 1 2009 	Our home in Beijing	We have stayed here each April for 2 weeks for the past 3 years , as we explore BeijingAlthough it is not close to the centre of Beijing, it is on the main road and also the subway (a trip on which we feel is part of the experience). It is also well placed , being on the 4th ring road, to the summer palace , and the great wall. The rooms are large and quiet and has free internet in the rooms along with a nice breakfast buffet that caters for all nationalities. (best to try and have this included in your package). The gym and pool are well appointed and kept very clean The staff are friendly and it well priced compared to the hotels in the city centre. Jul 22 2009 	Good Hotel in western Beijing	My friend recommended me this hotel, and I booked a room in which the hotel called Executive Floor. The main feature of this floor is a study; it is decorated with much age-old china and books to tell us what Chinese culture is look like; I love it. Generally speaking, the room is nice and the service is professional. The restaurant is pretty good, especially the buffet. It provided various delicious dishes and the price is affordable. What’s more, traffic is convenient. The hotel is nearby subway, and it’s easy to call taxi, and what I think the most convenient thing is the location. It is in the old residential district and there are many other restaurants and shops around it, so maybe you can find your flavor here and buy some articles for daily use, even kill time.I lived here just few days, but it is easy to be familiar with their staff. In this hotel, you will not feel like a foreigner or even a stranger, everyone here is friendly. According to my experience in Beijing, the hotel is your best choice if you stay in the Western Beijing. Dec 20 2008 	Best service in any hotel	This hotel is on the west side of Beijing. It is a little far from Downtown areas but a quick subway or $7 US taxi ride away. I have to say that the service in this hotel is the best I received anywhere. From the restaurant to the executive lounge to everything in the hotel they make you feel like a king. When you call for something a quick response is usually had in less than 2 minutes. This level of service could not be had in the US for almost any price. Plus, all the workers in this hotel are very professional and go above and beyond for guest.The rooms in this hotel are very nice. I would recommend paying for the executive floors. The rooms on the executive floor would be comparable to a 5 star hotel in the US. I do not think you could get a room this nice for $400 a night in New York. Plus, a buffet breakfast is included. Western and chinese food are offered and it is incredible the choices they have. Plus, the executive rooms allow 4 peices of laundry to be cleaned free of charge per day, and 6 soft drinks from the wet bar free of charge. You will have access to an amazing executive loung that offers free food at night and drinks. I was upgraded to the executive floor because of my platinum status. The regular rooms are nice, but a little old and not in comparison to the executive rooms.The main restaurant offers a nightly buffet for 128 RMB about $20 US. It is very elaborate and has Italian food and chinese food. It is vey good and the dishes change nightly. It includes local draft beer and coca cola. Over the 9 days my family stayed the staff got to know us. They are very friendly and will do everything to make you feel at home. Upon check out the General Manger came to greet my family.If you find yourself in westen beijing or do not mind a 20 minute ride to the center of the city stay here. It is half the price of the downtown hotels. remember to stay in an executive room and the extra 150 RMB $23 US or so a day is worth it. Aug 16 2008 	Buyer beware	I booked a room, later canceled it, yet charges were on my credit card statement. Holiday Inn informed me that because I booked the room online at a special rate I would not receive any refund. If you book a room here, make sure this is really where you want to stay. I switched to a different hotel because I found much better rates and accommodations though a locally owned and operated hotel. Jun 18 2008 	Ok Western hotel in China	Wanted to stay in Haidian since many of my clients are there so booked this hotel. However, it is some distance from Zhongguancun (sp) but in a typical quiet residential neighborhood. Also, some distance Forbidden City etc. although right off the main thoroughfare that leads to it. Breakfast buffet was ok. Since it is a Western hotel, didn't have problems typical of similarly rated Chinese hotels (e.g., hard bed (like sleeping on concrete), prostitution). So, if you want a Western hotel in Beijing but are willing to be a distance away from everything, it is a good hotel.The only thing that really disappointed me was the airport pick up. Had a client meeting within 2 hours of landing so wanted a quick pickup so I could drop off luggage and run to the meeting, but it took 20 minutes for the pickup to arrive. Would have been faster waiting in the taxi line (and a lot cheaper). Mar 19 2008 	Nice hotel but	I stayed here for 1 night March 15-16 for the the first American baseball games played in China. I choose this hotel because it's only a 10 minute walk from the new Olympic baseball stadium where the games were played. The new arena where the Olympic basketball games will be played is right next to the baseball stadium. The subway is also next to the baseball stadium making it also near the hotel.It's a very nice hotel with the front desk able to speak decent English. I choose a superior room for the separate shower, which also has an extra large bathroom and an electric pants press in the room. The bed is very comfortable. I booked the room on the Holiday Inn website and pre-purchaed my room and breakfast which saved me about $20. The breakfast is okay with a cooked to order omelet station. Nothing to brag about but the cost with the pre-booking was only about $8.BUT, the location is on the far west of Beijing. Sure it's near the subway. However, the subway was ALWAYS crowded whether it be afternoon or evening, Saturday or Sunday. The subway is only 26 cents one way though! A taxi from the airport took 1 hour and $18. Going back took only 45 minutes. The problem with relying with taxis is that the city traffic is so bad that it could take a while to get to this hotel from anywhere not taking the highway. I used the subways all the time except for the airport. To Tiananmen Square by subway took about 15-20 minutes. If you don't mind crowded but cheap subways, this hotel is half the cost of something more central. Jan 4 2008 	Nice hotel	Nice rooms, friendly staff. Close to the subway which is the fastest way to travel around Beijing. Go out the front, turn left go to the corner turn left again and it's just a few blocks down. Indoor pool is heated in winter so pack the swimsuit, breakfast is good but a little pricey...but it is a buffet with western food as well as Chinese and you can fill up for the day. Massage was cheap at the hotel and very good, though unlike in the US where you totally disrobe and get under a sheet they are not used to this and were a bit shocked. We really liked this hotel and the Chinese people were friendly and go out of their way to help if you need it. Not many people in China speak English but it wasn't a problem for us and most signage was in English too, even the subway makes stop announcements in English as well as Chinese. Overall hotel was great, and China was awsome! Must see's are the Wall, Summer Palace, Forbiden City, Teinamen Square, Temple of Heaven &amp; an acrobat show. The hotel can set up tours to any of these places and more, we used a tour for the wall &amp; acrobat show and explored the others on our own. Dec 10 2007	Very Nice Holiday Inn	Stayed in Holiday Inn Chang An West for three nights in Beijing. This particular hotel is a bit far off from the center. It is in the southwestern edge of the city and at least 30 minutes from popular areas such as Wangfujing and the Forbidden City. However, there is a subway station around 10 minutes walk from the hotel.To be honest, I was initially not expecting much from a Holiday Inn. However, I can probably say that this hotel is of four star quality. Though the interiors weren't any different from other places, this hotel gave off a pretty good ambiance. It could be because it was a relatively new hotel when I stayed there. The staff were helpful and gave me tips on where to go in the city. They knew how to speak good English. Maps of the city were also readily available in the counter.The rooms were very clean, well-appointed and most importantly, spacious. Standard amenities were included (toiletries, slippers, etc). High-speed internet was also available in the room, though it was certainly not free. I had to call for a technician to set-up my Apple laptop for internet use. Service was prompt and my laptop was ready for in no time. The breakfast buffet was okay. It was nothing special and the variety was pretty average. Aside from the usual Western fare (bacon, scrambled egg, etc), they also had some standard Chinese breakfast items such as congee, salted vegetables, etc.This is a good hotel overall. The only real downside is that it is a bit far from the center. Next time I am in Beijing, I would probably stay elsewhere simply because of convenience. Nevertheless, I still recommend the Holiday Inn Chang An for the traveler looking for good value but not really keen on a city center location. Sep 5 2007 	Nice Rooms	Stayed in Beijing for Business - had 3 rooms on the Executive Club floor. Service was good. Rooms were great - very large and clean. Bathroom was also very good. I had a seperate shower unit from the bathtub but that is not in every room. In room safe is handy. Executive Club offers 4 pieces free laundry per day which is nice for an extended stay. Free internet was good for business. Food was poor. Breakfast was good (custom made eggs) but lunch and dinner in the buffet restaurant was very poor. Very few Western or European dishes despite the restaurant being called Florence. Mainly Chinese food. Tried the satay in the bar but it was very tough. Red curry chicken in the Thai restaurant was good. Elevators slow in the morning but good bell hop service and access to cabs. Nov 6 2006 	Nice Holiday Inn	I just returned from a trip to China. First went to Beijing. There I met with a friend. We toke the airport bus to the hotel, and were dropped close to the hotel. We were in the Holiday Inn Chang An West and indeed it was a very good hotel. With swimmingpool and good massages for the body. But the temperature off the water is not so warm, 25-28 C.,so most of the time we had the whole pool for ourselves.But everything is wonderfully done and very clean.The breakfast was very tasty and western. The girls from the hotel where very helpfull and nice.The location of this hotel is on the west side of Beijing and with the metro, wich is 10 minutes walk from the hotel, you can get everywhere, cheap and quickly. If you get tired of huge Beijing you just take a taxi to the hotel for not so much money, or a bike.At the end of the street, where the hotel is situated, you have a whole street of restaurants, where you can eat cheap, good, clean and very interresting food.The hotel rooms were nice and clean, with a good shower and bad. Oct 24 2005	Holiday Inn Chan An	Just got back from Beijing for the first time really had a great time. My wife and Istayed at one of thenewr Holiday Inn's in Beijing and really loved the hotel. The rooms were fantastic with nice beds and very clean. Suprisingly they had quite a bit of room but only had 3 tv channels in english (discovery, cnn, and hbo). The location is good but if you are going to do organized tours don't be surprised if thye send a car for you to meet up with the bus at another hotel also your day will statr at 7am instead of 8am for most tours. Quite honestly though you can take the subway which is a ten minute walk and then another 10 to 15 minutes on the subway to reach the center of Bejing. From ther you can walk to Tian amen Square, Forbidden City, and Temple of Heaven. The subway will also get you to all the major shopping areas. There are a few thing that we weren't happy with. It is a long way from the airport and the ride is about 1 hour. Traffic in Beijing is pretty bad at al times. The hotel has 3 restraunts (Chinese, Italian, Thai) and we personally didn't eat at the Thai restraunt but wern't overly impressed with the other ones. We found no Italian food at the Italian restraunt and the Chines food was very greesy. Also a warning that a non-smoking section in China means that the table you are at has no smoking but not necessarily the ones around you. Thay do have a pool which I found not to be heated in October which I liked cause I like cold water but the two ladies I saw down there were pretty dissapointed. They also have a beauty salon but no one at speaks very good English so just order what services they offer and don't try to ask questions like my wife did cause it can get pretty frustrating.Overall though both my wife and I would highly reccomend the hotel and would stay there again if we ever went back. Oct 12 2009 	Very nice hotel"
"Oct 7 2009 	Not the best Holiday Inn in Beijing	I stayed here for one night in September of 2009 and then checked out early and went to the Holiday Inn Temple of Heaven. I was staying on the executive floor, and although the executive lounge was quite nice, I found the hotel overall to be rather average. The Holiday Inn Temple of Heaven (which I had stayed at before) was just a better choice. Better rooms, better service, better food and cheaper. This hotel is quite close to the subway, and if you are trying to get somewhere on the Blue Line, it might be a reasonable choice for you. Jul 23 2008	Excellent for business	This is a great hotel for the business traveller. Tastefully renovated rooms, flat screen TV and modern. The room I stayed in was large and bright. Close to the subway and a local supermarket as well as restaurants including Pizza Hut and other international brands. Great breakfast included in rate and a really nice area to sit out in the evening over drinks. Excellent value and much recommended. Jul 17 2008 	Great Location bargain price with excellent friendly staffs.	I had a choice of staying at swanky five star in the Financial street and more down to earth but comfortable holiday inn. I gave it a try to stay and I am happy i did it. Hotel has just completed renovation and rooms are brand new. Great friendly staffs. And just few minutes walk to Financial street. Will return again after the Olympics!!! Jan 13 2008 	winter break	Travelled from U.K to Hong Kong then on to N.Z. and Australia finally arriving in Beijing after 6 weeks of travelling feeling rather weary. Arrived late at the hotel but found the reception desk staff very efficient and extremely helpful. Our executive double room was perfect. Booking in at executive level does not cost much more than normal rates but allows use of the exec. lounge which has many perks. The staff in this lounge were very helpful (A special mention for Sofia)and pleasant at all times contrary to the experiences quoted by one reviewer and the laundry service just brilliant. The food selection is wide enough to suit any palate and the staff are very efficient.Because of the forthcoming Olympic Games the hotel is being updated (as are so many others) but this did not affect our enjoyment at all. I consider this hotel to be very good value for money and will definitely be back. Oct 26 2007 	Good but stay spoiled by poor service	I was in Beijing for a trade show recently, stayed at the Holiday Inn Downtown Beijing.There is much to like about this hotel, but unfortunately my stay was spoiled by one incident of extremely poor customer service which I will relate at the end of this review.The hotel is nothing fancy - the buiding is quite old and basic, the lobby is quite small. The rooms are currently undergoing rennovation, so there is a bit of noise during the day, but not at an hour where it will disurb you.My room was on the executive floor and was really very nice. Obviously a room that had already undergone rennovation. The bed was very comfortable, there was plenty of space and there was a 32&quot; flat panel LCD television. The bathroom was exquisite, with a very large shower with one of those rain heads. There is no bathtub, but that doesn't bother me.Nice touches are that the executive level floor has complimentary internet (a very fast connection), complimentary soft drinks and beer and up to 100RMB of complimentary laundry per day (which I didn't use).I ate the dinner buffet on my first night there, which was a mistake. The food was not very good. But the breakfast buffet was much better with a good selection including omlettes made to order. I also ate the dim sum lunch in their Chinese restaurant which was very good, and pretty reasonably priced.The hotel's gym was a dissapointment and I didn't end up using it since they were missing an eliptical cross trainer. I didn't use the pool- its indoor and quite small, but certainly looks usable.Location was a bit mixed. Its not really very close to anything, but it is located very close to a subway station, and there are a few restaurants and a large indoor market nearby.Overall the hotel is very good value and the whole time I was there I was thinking to myself that I would stay there again, but unfortunately my good experience with the hotel was soured by my checkout experience. I had a late flight, so I asked for a late checkout, and hey gave me until 2pm. At 2pm I moved to the executive lounge where I wanted to do a bit of work, and needed an internet connection. Now take into consideration that Internet connection was included in my room rate, I asked to extend my connection for 2 hours. The girl in the executive lounge categorically refused, and she insisted that I pay for the connection. I was a bit shocked at this, and I find it ludicrous that they would jeopardise my future patronage for something so trivial. This knowing that I spend about 30 nights per year in Intercontinental brand hotels. Shame, because they got almost everything else right. Oct 18 2007	Great buffet restaurant	Stayed in this hotel for three nights at the beginning of October. Lovely room with huge shower. The breakfast buffet was the best we had on our tour of China. Very attentive staff tied your handbag to your chair whilst you browsed the buffet. The swimming pool was downstairs off the bar.Used it once but it was a bit cold. Sockets in bedrooms took English plugs. First time condoms have been included in a mini bar! There is an ATM within easy walking distance also several Western restaurants. Actually went out for a pizza one night. Ate in the hotel another evening, again a fantastic buffet with food from all over the world. Everything from sushi to steaks and pasta. Nice to have a lit up clock radio in the bedroom too.There is a department store close to the hotel and the other side of the main road a market on 4 or 5 floors. Bought some clothes in the market but have to say felt a bit hassled doing so.Felt very safe out and about the hotel. Oct 8 2007	Good hotel but maybe give the laundry service a miss!	The interior is nice and fresh looking and it is situated in a good location with shops and food places near by.My room was small but really good in terms of comfort and cleanliness. It was also very nice and quiet with thick walls.The reastaurant on the ground floor was ok. Plenty of selection but didn't always look that appealing. However, you could find enough to ensure you ate well before or after embarking on some major sightseeing!There are plenty of shops inside the hotel selling gifts, Chinese Tea, snacks etc and a swimming pool and spa, beauty salon, business centre with internet access. All are a little over priced and you can only barter the prices in the souvenier shops!All in all I would definitely recommend this hotel. My only complaint was the laundry service. My clothes came back ironed but not washed and one of my tops had a faint mark on it which it hadn't had previously!! As you can imagine I was pretty hacked off to say the least. However, the general manager (a young lady) was very helpful and understanding and ensured that I didn't get charged but lets face it, that was the least they could do really. Aug 14 2007 	A great bargain	I chose this hotel because I needed an inexpensive place to stay in unfamiliar territory - a trusted name like Holiday Inn fit the bill, and having a &quot;Holiday Inn Downtown Beijing&quot; sounded charming. I wasn't disappointed at all, as my expectations were not that high. The rooms are small, clean and basic. The pool was a perk, though I only used it once. The staff at the cafe was cordial, if not overbearing in their attempts to accommodate. Ordering a drink involved three people, but they were all smiling and graciously offered their hospitality quickly. The same goes for the front desk and bellhops - always ready to help.The hotel offered a day excursion to the Great wall, a Jade factory, and a few other places. I think I paid less than $50 for the whole deal - including lunch. Well worth it. Nearby is a supermarket (near the exit of the subway) that had everything I needed at a fraction of the cost of NYC. Smokes were $1 a pack, Evian .50 for 2 liters... amazing. The room had a fridge, so I stocked up on beer too. :)Across the street (near the hospital) is an excellent restaurant. Not fancy by any means, but the food is delicious. A full dinner for two with beer cost about $4.00. Venturing out into the city revealed so many places to eat, but beware - English is hardly spoken.In closing, I recommend the Holiday Inn. I found the weekly rate hard to beat. I think my bill came $150 or so. Aug 14 2007	Nice food and location shame the room didn't match.	This hotel is conveniently located for the shops and the metro. it is currently undergoing a much needed renovation which was noisy during the day but didn't carry on at night or start early in the morning. The rooms show their age. Ours was ok, the carpet was a bit stained. Others in our group had rooms that were more delapidated and my parents had a room with a window that backed onto a storeroom which they did not notice on arrival at 2 a.m. The food is good. A wide range of styles for breakfast and in the reasonably priced evening buffet. They could do with a non-smoking area or better ventilation in the restaurant. I would be happy to stay there again. Jul 10 2007	Great Value in Beijing	My experience could not be more different to the last review. The room I had was excellent, small but new. The staff were great - limited English but they did their very best to accommodate my needs. The hotel location is not the best, but for the price it is pretty good. Very close to a metro stop and taxis are very cheap by western standards so it was easy to get out and about. Overall, if you are coming to Beijing you could do a lot worse that the Holiday Inn Downtown. Jul 4 2007 	awful place	We stayed at this place for 4 nights last summer. It was awful.The staff are not professional at all. The rooms are small and torn.In one of the two rooms we had, the toilet system was just working from time to time. They tried to repair it 4 times!!!That was on the executive floor in a Holiday Inn Hotel!!!!The only good thing with this hotel is that it is close to the subway. May 31 2007	Safe bet for a Holiday Inn!	We were pretty satisfied with our room while in Beijing. Internet access did cost a minimal amt, but it was worth it. The beds were HARD as rocks, as I have found that all bedding in China is hard for some reason. At least they had soft sheets and down comforters to make things better. They were doing some construction while we were there, so there was some noise throughout the day, but nothing unbearable. This hotel was VERY close to the subway which was the ideal way to get around Beijing. THe driving there is utterly crazy so I felt better taking my chances on the underground transportation. Everyone was fairly helpful. the buffet in the morning was very good, with alot of Westernly food or chinese food, whatever your heart desired. I was actually very satisfied with the cleanliness and the hotel itself.. May 19 2007	Mmmmm.....will you stay there again!	This was our first visit to Beijing, on arrival at the Holiday Inn Downtown Beijing the reception is OK and staff seemed to be quite willing to help. However, the rooms on the other hand......They are quiet tired and look like they need a real overhaul. The rooms are quite a fair size, the bathroom is OK in size too. The view from the rooms we had were not all that great we looked out onto what we could only say was other room!!!! The food was OK. The buffet was good value for money.With the Olympics coming to Beijing in 2008, I hope they can bring this hotel back to form. May 14 2007 	Value for money	I have spent 6 nights at Holiday Inn Downtown Beijing in May 2007. Location of the hotel - this is not really city center, but it is reasonably close to it, with cheap taxis and subway 5 minutes away (which by the way costs USD 0.4 to reach any other station). By subway you can reach Tian An Men and Forbidden City in 15 minutes. There are some nice restaurants (in Chinese ones you can expect very poor contact in English).The drive to the airport by taxi is less than one hour and costs about CNY 120 (~USD 15).The room was very nice, reasonable size and clean. The staff was helpful, but as usual there were people that were really outstanding, and on some shifts they were just ok. Nevertheless - they have addressed most of our requests quickly and effectively.What I liked a bit less were:- buffett breakfast, with rather limited selection- english literacy of the staff - for the first time in my life I couldn't easily communicate in English in hotel restaurant of &quot;Holiday Inn&quot; networkGenerally, I'd say - value for money. If I come to Beijing again I will consider to stay there, although it will not be an obvious choice, and I will check some other options as well. May 10 2007 	OK	I asked the receptionist for a map of Beijing, they gave me a tear-out map from a magazine. I was more impressed at HI Downtown Shanghai, they provided me a real tourist map of Shanghai.Some of the Receptionists still need more training in English and message consolidation - I asked for a room change becuase our AC was not working (it was even colder outside) and the receptionist I asked didn't know that the other receptionist had already booked us a new room. The first receptionist even told us that there are already no rooms available.The same thing happened when another receptionist asked me to call them when we have successfully transferred rooms. So I called, and another receptionst answered and had no idea what I was trying to explain - that we have already transferred rooms - and this took some 3 mins and a lot of broken English before she actually handed the phone to the her co-receptionist who finally understood what I was saying... Apr 10 2007 	Good hotel convenient to the subway	The Holiday Inn Downtown is a good value for a Beijing hotel. We found the room to be comfortable, if a bit small. The public areas of the hotel are very nice, although the pool is too small for adult use.We enjoyed the dinning options, and there are a number of western friendly restaurants next door.Access to the subway is one block away, which is very convenient. Apr 3 2007 	Good place quirky but we liked it	Ah, Beijing, what an amazing place. I have certainly stayed in nicer, more modern hotels but I remember our overall experience at the Holiday Inn &quot;Downtown&quot; very fondly, in keeping with the whole experience in Beijing.First, location: I am not sure what they mean by Downtown--this hotel is on the northwest edge of the second ring road, not far from the zoo (you can walk to the zoo). This is I guess more central than somewhere out beyond the 5th ring road, but it is not in a central business district. However, there is a metro stop a few blocks away, so access to Tiananmen Square, etc, is quite easy. When the new metro line is completed the Olympic stadium will be very easy to access from this hotel. Note that the metro stops running at around 10:30 pm. However, taxis are cheap and plentiful and really are the mainstay of transport for tourists in this sprawling city. The hotel is also on the side of the city closest to the Summer Palace which makes access to that marvelous sight fairly easy.The rooms were clean, towels and toiletries were very good, but bathrooms and furniture were tired and outdated, feeling like an old, unrenovated motel in the US. However, internet access was extremely fast and the English-speaking staff provided very friendly service. Cable TV had many channels in English as well as Chinese. On our first night the concierge wrote directions to a nightlife area which we showed to a taxi driver and we had a great time at a nightclub where an excellent Cuban band was playing Latin hits. There is a cash-exchange machine in the lobby which converts euros or US dollars to RMB for a small fee--very convenient.My only regret is that we didn't have more time in Beijing, a fascinating and beautiful place. I would stay at this hotel again. Apr 2 2007 	Recommended	This hotel is not fancy, but the room was clean and well maintained, the staff was very helpful and the location was great. This hotel advertised it is close to the subway and they did not lie. It takes only 5 minutes to walk to the subway. Also, there are restaurants (like McDonalds and Pizza Hut), markets and shopping nearby. In fact, right across the street, there is the Wan Tong? Wholesale Market (take exit D when exiting the subway), which is like the silk market but bigger. If you don't want to eat breakfast at the hotel, there is a 'fast-food' breakfast place across the street that serves dumplings, noodles and warm soy milk (traditional northern Chinese style) that was surprisingly good, satisfying and also very reasonably priced. Overall, we were very pleased with our stay at this hotel. Jan 21 2007 	Holiday Inn Beijing is the best value for tourists	If you are traveling to Beijing for tourism, then you should definately consider the Holiday Inn Beijing! The staff all speak excellent English and we never had a problem communicating while I was there. The hotel is in a good location to access all the major tourist destinations. I usually do my trip planning on my own; however, in Beijing I would recommed purchasing an organized tour by bus. This was the first time we had taken a tour and it was much better than we had expected. The rooms are comfortable and indicative of a high 2.5* rating. We also used the business centre for Internet access, but I remember the rates being quite expensive. The buffet breakfast each morning was outstanding and a great value considering the very low rates at this hotel. We also ate all of our non-tour meals at the hotel because it offered a great variety of food at low prices. For a laugh, go to their Chinese restaurant and order pigeon, it's actually quite good! There are also a couple of shopping markets close by and there are some larger banks for using ATMs on the main street just outside the front doors. I would highly suggest to any of my friends to stay at the Holiday Inn Beijing for a high level of convenience and value. If you prefer higher end luxury, then there are probably better options, but for less than $100 a night it can't be beat! Jan 15 2007	I loved it. The food is very good the rooms clean and comfortable.	There are shops where you can buy all your souveniers, if you do not have time to go to the friendship store. All the staff are friendly, eficient and lots speak very good English. For a bit of fun, try the vegitarien resteraunt. Dishes with names like &quot;Shallow stream meandering through a tranquil wood&quot;. Very Zen. Great steam room, jacusi and swimming pool. Marvelous supermarket just outside the back door. If buying mens pants beware. I took silk to wash at night. The air conditioning in my room was so good that they would not dry over night. I had to buy 3XL for my 38&quot; waist and they were snug. In the supermarket buy some Sechuan Salt. Add it to the rice, that is the only way to give it any taste. It is NOT 15 minutes to the centre of town. There is a mini bus that takes one in for free but with Beijing trafic it takes an hour to an hour and a quarter. It is fun looking out of the window. Staff also take it and a 'nee how' especially to a child can get you into a mime conversation.I loved it! Jan 9 2007 	Disappointing	Although I booked two non-smoking rooms and was confirmed, they were not able to provide as such. After several room changes, the family ended up on two different floors for the first night.Front staff do not smile, and the f&amp;b staff in the cafe were downright unfriendly. Weren't rude, just abrupt and unsmiling. Definetly not one of the best hotel I have stayed in.Corridors were long and the ceiling low. Felt like an old hotel that has been added to.Breakfast was very pricey in comparison to other hotels, and the lobby uncomfortable.The only good thing about the hotel were the gorgeous female concierges outside assisting customers with taxis, and the nearby street of all kinds of Chinese cuisines. Had a fanstastic dinner at one of them that served Hunan Provincial food, and the owner there spoke excellent English and was able to recommend some dishes. Makes a change from stabbing in the dark.Definite room for improvement. Jan 5 2007 	Fantastic	My husband and i have just returned from the Holiday Inn Downtown and had a fantastic stay. We stayed for four nights over the Christmas period and then returned again after returning from Shanghai.The hotel has recently had a complete room refurbishment so they are in tip top condition, the bathrooms do not have baths put do have a great shower and a rain shower.Granted the hotel is not in the center of the city but it is only 5km from the Forbidden city and a taxi only costs about US$2 and the underground is a couple of minutes walk away. Also nearby are a range of &quot;Western style&quot; restaurants such as Sizzler and McDonalds.In the foyer is a tour desk where greyline tours are available to numerous places and the staff are very willing to help, even booking a train to Xian for us without extra charge.The hotel in my opinion is great value for money and well worth every penny/cent. Nov 8 2006	A little tired but pefectly adequate	As other reviewers have said it is quite a way out of the city centre, but it's easy enough for taxi's &amp; the Metro.The hotel is tired and is being re-furbished floor by floor. Our room was fine but like most hotels in China it is noisy from the constant traffic outside. Take ear plugs or ask for a room away from the traffic. The food in the hotel is good whether you eat Chinese or western, the breakfast is particularly good.If you are thinking of staying at this hotel or have already booked don't worry you will enjoy your stay &amp; be quite comfortable, after all you won't be spending much time in the hotel, you will be out enjoying the stes of Beijing Sep 7 2006	Don't read the negative reports about this hotel	We stayed at this hotel for 5 nights at the beginning of September 2006. OK, so it's not in the centre of Beijing - but it's 2 minutes from the underground station, the staff are charming and helpful, the breakfast kept us going all day, our room was large with two 3/4 double beds, there is a Sizzler, Pizza Hut and MacDonalds around the corner plus some very good Chinese Restaurants and best of all it was great value for money. We paid £50 a night for a twin room, bed and breakfast. Travel on the underground costs 3Yuan and taxis were cheap enough to use at the end of a long day sightseeing. We would highly recommend this hotel to people who don't have high expectations of a Western 5 star hotel. Aug 30 2006 	It's OK but you can probably do better	We stayed here three nights (see Coutyard By Marriot Beijing for our other Beijing Hotel experience). The place is under construction right now, but there was no smell of it.Our non-smoking room was large and OK, but definitely aged. Staff came around one afternoon asking to enter and clean the vents. This place will indeed benefit from a renovation.Regarding the pool- I must say that they are small. Think of a standard US Hotel rectangular pool, and imagine two kidney bean shaped pools fitted inside that (with about 4 - 5 feet of separation between the two). Our kids are young so they actually loved the layout, but most adults would consider the pool to be small.We ate the hotel buffet dinner one night. It was decent but uninspiring. We ate breakfast in some local restuarants- actually there are two fine Chinese restaurants just a block away. (Yes, they are mainly for natives, but again, with a menu and some good pointing I think you can do just fine to get good, local food at a local price.). Sizzler is also just down the block. There is also a shopping center just around the corner- we ate in their food court one night, and did some shopping. I think the &quot;downtown&quot; name is a misnomer, but it's not a terrible location. (Very close to the train station as well).If I were attending the 2008 Olympic games, and this was the only 4 star hotel left, I'd stay in a heartbeat. But during normal time, when there's plenty of hotel capacity in Beijing, I'd shop around and probably stay elsewhere. Aug 30 2006 	Little far out of CBD	Good quality hotel. Only problem is that the Hotel is a little out of Beijing CBD. On a packaged holiday with tour guides and bus/driver at your disposal this does not present a problem but if travelling on own this hotel is a little too far out of centre of town.The Hotel has department stores around it for those who want to shop.The Hotel facilities and the quality of food it provides in its restaraunt is very good.Nice touch about this hotel was the fruit basket in reception for guests. Aug 1 2006 	Terrible and Unbelievable	this is the worst hotel in the Holiday Inn chai that I have ever stayed in and possibly exists.Do not I repeat do not ever ever stay in this tip which they call a hotel unless you are used to the rubbish UK B&amp;B hotels in england.My toilet bath tub is bigger that the swiming pool they have ( I cant believe they called a swiming pool ).Absolutely DiaboliqueIf you want agreat hotel In beijing then there is only the one and only North Crown Plaza Beijing Hotel its right up there with the best hotels in the world the service the rooms and everything is 6 stars not 5.This is the first and last time to stay in this Down town rubbish hotel what a waste of my holiday absolutely ruined, I was here till the 01 aug and I could not wait to get out !!Trust me avoid this place like it has a plaque Jun 5 2006	Great place to stay	My husband and I just returned from a stay at the HOLIDAY INN DOWNTOWN in Beijing and found this hotel very friendly and in a great location. There were American restaurants within the same block as the hotel and we never had a problem flagging down a cab right on the street in front of the hotel. There was a greyline tour office in the lobby where we booked a great tour of the GREAT WALL and MING TOMBS. The breakfast every morning was wonderful and they served american and chinese food. They had a chef who worked at a grill and you could order eggs, pancakes, frenchtoast and he made it right there while you waited. The room was on the small side, but was clean and the bathroom was newlly remodeled in marble and granite. This hotel looks like it is getting ready for the 2008 Olympics and whoever stays here will not be disappointed. dated June 5, 2006 Jun 2 2006	Good value makes this hotel above average choice	The location of this very American-style older Holiday Inn coupled with its low room rates makes it a good choice for a basic hotel. There are two upgraded &quot;Business Floors&quot; and a single &quot;Executive Floor&quot; presumably with even more amenities. My Business Floor room was of average size and very quiet. The bathroom was clean and well maintained, and the air-conditioning was very good. Caution: This may not apply to regular rooms in the hotel. The room was cleaned promptly each morning, and a local English language newspaper was delivered to my door. High speed internet service was US$6 per day. The breakfast buffet for US$11(if not included in yoru room rate) was expensive by Beijing standards, but far exceeded anything you would get in a comparable American hotel, and was well worth the price. The gym was dated and small, and good for only basic workouts. The indoor pool under a Holidome style atrium was small, but very clean. The hotel has a Grayline tour desk, which is also handy, and the subway line, and a full line supermarket in the basement of a large department store are just around the corner. If you feel the need for American food, a new Sizzler is next door. This would be a good economical choice for families on vacation. May 25 2006	Absolute Luxury	I really think the other reviewer stayed in a different hotel. Especially considering Sizzlers a fab restaurant is just around the corner. I went on a group tour so we were bused everywhere so I am not sure of the location although it is very close to the underground which brings you right into the centre of Beijing. The hotel was lovely. Pool was clean and nice, Hairdressers were very good and cheap. Breakfast I wasn't to keen on but there was a large choice. Fruit selection was good when available. Only had dinner twice and neither was very good. Jan 11 2006	Good value	Considering the cost of hotels during national week this particular hotel was value for the money. We were able to walk to the zoo as well as local shops.The hotel has a good buffet for breakfast and there is a large variety to choose. Internet averaged $2 american dollars for 10 mins (which is expensive)We found the rooms on the small side but were clean. I would recommend this hotel to families as well to others travelling on a budget. Nov 19 2005	Dreadful	This place is truly awful in three ways: (a) location, (b) rooms and (c) the facilities. The great buffet breakfast is why it is a 2/5 instead of a 1/5.It is called Holiday Inn Downtown, well, it is not downtown at all, it is downtown plus 12km uptown. Beside the overpriced restarant, there is no restaurant or convenience shops in the vicinity. However there is a McDonalds 10 minutes away by foot.The hallways, common areas and rooms are truly atrocious. Dirty. Small. Dark. The hotel constantly gave off the message that it hadn't been renovated since 1971 and I was very angry with Holiday Inn's misleading online advertising. After my first and last night there, I gave Holiday Inn a good mouthful and they offered me a free night at their king suite the next time I am in Beijing. I did not try to give that voucher to any of my mates or family because I did not want any one to endure such misery.Pictures are attached, make up your own mind. Actually, I can appreciate where Holiday Inn are coming from now, the pictures do the room too much justice. Nov 24 2009	sådär Nov 5 2009 	?????????????"

RIP I don't know if enough of others agree and I guess I'll see by the downvotes but it's concerning me that autoblog is posting anything news relevant with cars. I don't know if I'm one of the few but I come here to get away from tragic news, to enjoy my hobby and get away from politics and the real world which is cruel and ruthless at times. Now anything related to cars, whether it's a death, rape, accident, what next, drive by? and it gets a space here. Why? Is that really automotive news? At first I could somewhat understand the youtube finds even though I don't click them I figure they are light hearted but to come on here and read serious news just because there is a car involved or car in the background just doesn't seem right and doesn't seem fitting. And it's getting more and more space too. There are so many other places for news and tragedies around the world, do we really need to see it plastered here as well in the guise of car news? Yesterday at 4:41 PM Report abuse Permalink 2 replies to Jimmy's comment Since their motto is ""We obsessively cover the auto industry"" this is very much relevant. What isn't relevant is so many of the other things they post which are loosely related to cars but have nothing to do with the auto industry. 10 hours ago Report abuse Permalink They post everything the can about cars. If you don't want to read the news, don't click on the damn link. 8 hours ago Report abuse Permalink This is horrible, my heart goes out to the family. I will say I'm disappointed at Autoblog's article, though. It seems disingenuous to plaster a huge Nissan logo on the story, and call it ""the second death at the plant in recent years"" (with the undertone of suggesting that the plant is unsafe) when neither death seems to have actually been related to Nissan's procedures or the plant itself. The first one was a truck accident, and the more recent one was a contractor working for another company that 'makes paint systems for Nissan' and was probably in the process of installing the large electric panel that fell. The third article also mentions another accident where a supplier was seriously injured while repairing a machine. All of these things SUCK, but they don't seem to show the plant is unsafe.

The worker had worked there for over 20 years,and was near retirement age. He is also a huge man. I think the company no doubt saw him as a liability. He was outspoken about stuff too which didn\'t help matters. I just thought this was sorry as all get out esp. considering the man has also lost his Dad and a young grandson in the last year or so.

"Nov 17 2009 	Hotel is OK...Service is Horrible	I brought my team from all over China to Beijing for a conference and we stayed at this hotel for two nights. When we arrived, we were informed that the hotel might not have hot water in the morning but our reservations were pre-paid so there was nothing we could really do about it! Then we discovered that the hotel’s main elevator bank wasn’t working so we had to use an alternative set of elevators that were located very far from our rooms. When I finally got to the room, it was really HOT. There were no windows I could open to cool off the room, there was no air conditioning that worked, and thus no way to cool down the room. When I asked for another room, they refused to move me until I threaten to leave the hotel. They finally gave in and found a room that wasn’t sweltering hot. All-in-all, if the hotel had things like hot water, well regulated temperatures in the rooms, and friendly service, it would be a decent hotel but I am not going back to give it another try. Nov 10 2009 	you get more than what you pay for	Booked this hotel after I had arrived at the airport and found out my flight home was cancelled. Furthermore, the next flight was not for 2 days so I was getting two extra nights and one extra day in China. Room was very spacious, clean, comfortable, and inexpensive. Close proximity to subway station and easy walking distance to Olympic Park. Oct 20 2009 	Great Value for Money	Hotel in good location with 10 minute walk to Olympic Park and five minute walk to subway. Out of city centre, but easy to get there by subway or taxi. Surrounded by wide new footpaths which are not too busy and provide a nice break from the chaos of the city centre.Entry is at the rare of the hotel via a small road, which is a little confusing at first.Several restaurants within easy walking distance.Breakfast was mediocre, although restaurant patio area nice.Internet fast and efficient.Room was nice and new, and a good size. Typical for HI Express.The only problem was that the air conditioning had been turned off (as of mid-October) and we found it a bit hot in our room.Service was good, but front desk was often very busy. Aug 22 2009 	Great base for a visit to Beijing	I stayed in a total of five hotels on my recent trip to China. The rooms in this hotel are without a doubt the largest. The showers are fantastic. I visited a total of ten days in this hotel. I loved the fact that there is a laundry room with washers and dryers. Also a section set aside for ironing your clothes. This is a great time and money saver especially when traveling with a family. Just throw your clothes in the washer and have a shower. Toss them in the dryer while you eat breakfast and you are ready to iron your clothes. So I recommend this hotel if you are staying for some time in Beijing. Another thing is the fact that they have a section where you can get a flight booked on the spot. I used this service and they were very good at helping me find a flight to Shanghai.This hotel is located within walking distance from the Olympic Bird's Nest and Water Cube. There is a subway located right around the corner from the hotel. I used the subway only once since taxis are very inexpensive. The fare from the hotel to the Forbidden City is five dollars US. The subway is about thirty cents US. The travel time on the subway is thirty five minutes which includes two transfers. The time with a taxi is about the same or more depending on the traffic. So as far as cost is concerned, you can stay at a similar hotel closer to central Beijing but you will pay so much more money. I recommend just setting aside the dollars for the taxi and save the money you would spend at another hotel. So location for me is still very good since you are in a more traditional Chinese area and not surrounded by tourists all day. Believe me, you will want a break from them since they are everywhere at the sites. Besides, the taxis are plentiful and the hotel can call one for you for an extra three yuan.There are five computers by the lobby that are available 24/7. All are super fast and never a problem. The breakfast is more traditional Chinese but you have a large selection. There is an outdoor section where you can have your breakfast. Very peaceful and beautiful with a pond. A perfect place for a relaxing drink after a day of seeing the sites. The hotel is extremely clean. Totally spotless. The rooms have very comfortable beds with wonderful sheets. A nice touch was a total of four pillows. Two regular pillows and one with a label &quot;hard&quot; and the other with the label &quot;soft.&quot; They even go as far as to make sure you are happy with a certain pillow. The rooms are spacious and include a love seat with a table and a full desk for your paper work. The front office manager, Jay Wu, is very helpful with local information and ensures that you are comfortable during your stay. A real professional. His staff is extremely friendly and do their best to assist with any questions. A few are still learning English but it is charming to see them get together in Chinese attempting to find the best solution and answer to a question. I have to say that these are really the nicest people you can meet and will do their upmost to ensure a pleasant stay. This hotel is really a hidden gem not only for the superior value for the money but also for the outstanding attitude and service provided by all of the employees. Very highly recommended!!! Jul 24 2009 	You get a lot for what you pay especially for a longer stay	An all-around excellent hotel with all the amentities needed for a longer stay--laundromat, complimentary internet and daily breakfast. Clean, spacious room and luxurious shower. The two downpoints are: breakfast and location. First, the daily breakfast was the same bland combinations of foods. Second, location--while you're close to the Olympic village, Bird's Nest, Water Cube, International Convention Center, you're far from the city's action and historical sites (minimum 15 minute ride). Moreover, 9 of 10 taxis did not know the location so you'll have to get a quick grasp of direction if you stay here. Note that it's near the McDonald's on Minzuyuan Road. It's a 5-minute-walk to the main road to hail a cab, or you can have the hotel call one for you for 3RMB extra. I also heard there's a subway station nearby but didn't have an opportunity to use it. Jun 10 2009 	Nice modern hotel and great value	This is a very new hotel 1 subway stop from the Olympic Stadium. My room was modern and typical of what you would find in a newly built HI Express in the US. It was good sized with a large LCD TV (only 2-3 English channels) and a large bathroom and a very large walk-in shower. (The water stopped totally for 20 min one morning - probably the city's fault and not the hotel's.) There was good closet space and a free in-room safe. The room overlooked a large atrium - the rooms which look outside are larger and cost more. There are 4 or 5 free computer terminals in the lobby. Breakfast was pretty much the same each day - it was basic Chinese food which may not appeal to Westerners. The hotel is 2 blocks from a modern subway station, but you have to walk down an alley which is completely dark at night - however, it is far safer than big cities in the US - Beijing is full of police and soldiers - this is a Communist country. Behind the hotel is the Chinatown shopping center (that really is the name in neon English letters) with a few fast food places and endless stalls selling all sorts of stuff. If you want to buy gifts, prices are much cheaper here than around Wangfujing or the other tourist sites - but you should still bargain. The front desk staff speaks adequate English. Most customers are Chinese tour groups, with a smattering of business types and Westerners. I booked for around $40 a night, which was great value considering how new the hotel is. Nothing special - but comfortable, dependable, clean, and safe. May 11 2009 	Great Price	Great Location, Excellent Price!! I went after the olympics and wanted to see the new buildings. it was perfect. walking distance to the Olympic venues. Somewhat of a drive anywhere else, but taxis are so cheap, it doesn't matter. breakfast and internet included (though breakfast was not too yummy). After staying in a fancier hotel (courtyard by marriot) this one is amazing for the price. Since its a new hotel, everything is super clean. I wish I would have stayed there the whole time; it would have saved me a lot of $$$$!!!! Apr 7 2009 	Not the place for a family	We ended up staying here for the Paralympics in September. A very mixed stay in terms of the hotel.First the good:1. Hotel seemed very new, the rooms were very clean and well maintained. 2. Compared to other hotels we looked at this one was cheaper and a great value for the money.3. Breakfast each morning in the lobby was great - Although it was the same each day, and after 10 days I was tired of it!4. subway stop right by the hotel5. free internet in the lobbyThe Bad:1. The front desk spoke little english, so was not able to help with getting around the city.2. It is located in a dark back alley, so it is hard to find. the picture you see from the website is not the main entrance, so it is misleading.3. There is not much around the hotel when we arrived. It looked like a mcdonalds was being built so that woudl be a bonus at this point.4. When we checked out the front desk would not call us a cab, so this was problematic getting to the airport.In short - I am not sure this is the place to stay if you do not speak the local language, or have a family. I was difficult to find things to eat by the hotel for the kids, though the mcdonalds that is being built would have been huge! Mar 5 2009 	Great value new hotel in good area by Birds Nest	I stayed in this hotel for a week in January and another week in March. This is a new hotel in the Holiday Inn group, which has numerous hotels in Beijing and elsewhere in China. The Express brand normally appeals to those on business - rooms are wll priced, they include a decent breakfast and broadband is free. This place attracts a lot of domestic bus tour groups. Staff here are excellent - quite a few English speakers. Hotel is about 2 blocks from subway, which is a real plus. Only downside is that the hotel building has a poor standard of construction. I've stayed in several rooms and the usual Chinese plumbing problems are everywhere. But overall this is a great value hotel and priced very well for Beijing. Dec 5 2008 	LIke an Ex I couldn't stay away from	I stayed at the Holiday Inn Minzuyuan for a total of about six weeks from September through October '08. The hotel has a few problems, but for the rate I got (between 300-400 RMB depending on how early I booked), it is a steal. This is an extremely nice, new, modern hotel. Free internet access (in your room if you have a laptop or in the lobby if you don't) and an actual laundry room (buy tokens at the front desk) were major pluses given my lengthy stay. On the downside, service could be a bit slow when the tour busses hit (which they often did), no attempt was made to keep people from smoking in the non-smoking dining area (Welcome to China!), a few times I had no hot water, once no heat. Given how long I stayed, however, I was bound to experience some problems.The area is a bit surreal. The hotel looks out on the Ethnic Minority People's Park, kind of a mini-Epcot to show how happy all of China's ethnic minorities are. Next to that is, I kid you not, a beautiful mosque that has been converted into an OUTLET MALL!There are several new Chinese fast food restaurants just behind the hotel and a new &quot;China Town&quot; (no kidding...I thought Beijing was a China town) with a first floor filled with shops selling traditional Chinese goods and a second more akin to the Silk Market. The hotel is near the Beitucheng Subway Station, at the intersection of Lines 10 and 8. That means it is not close to major tourist attractions, besides the Olympic venues which attract many Chinese tourists. Sep 14 2008 	Nice Hotel - handy local area	We stayed at this hotel during the Paralympics in Beijing. We were looking for a less expensive alternative to all of the &quot;official&quot; hotels endorsed by the local organizing committee, and this one was great.The hotel appears to have been newly built or re-decorated, as everything is sparkling clean and brand-new. The lobby and common areas of the hotel are beautiful, and staff are constantly cleaning to keep it that way. Our rate came with breakfast daily, and the food was pretty good. The daily offering was pretty much the same, with Asian and western breakfast basics such as toast, jam, bacon, sausage, potatoes, fried rice, congee, eggs, tea and coffee, and juice. Food is refreshed constantly, so we never had to wait for anything.Hotel staff is very polite, and try very hard to speak English, although some do better than others. The front desk staff all speak a bit of English, and one or two quite well.The rooms were well appointed, and the bathrooms are GREAT! It had the best shower I have ever experienced in a hotel - it was large (big enough for at least 2 people), and had a large, luxiourius spray. Soap, shampoo, toothbrush and paste, hairdryer are provided by the hotel. We found the beds a bit hard, but we got used to them after a while. The TV was a large flatscreen.The hotel was within easy walking distance to the Olympic Green (20 minutes), and there are lots of local restaurants, including take-out places. Overall, a great experience. I would definitely stay here again, and would recommend it Jul 12 2009 	????????"
"Nov 6 2009 	Beyond Expectations	Upon our arrival we were please to find that Holiday Inn had met our request for an early check in of 7am! The rooms were way beyond our expectations - after a long day of sightseeing we could look forward to returning to the comfort of our room. The free wi-fi in the rooms and the computer terminals provided at common areas were a real bonus. Receptionist were helpful. Only possible downside is the location - not walking distance to a subway. However it is very conveninent and relatively cheap to catch a bus or cab. For the price paid and the quality of the rooms and service provided, I would highly recommend this hotel and would definitely stay here again if I were to return to Beijing! Oct 15 2009 	much nicer than expected	This was a lovely hotel. The rooms were large, comfortable, clean and well equipped. The bed was by far the most comfortable I experienced during our month in China. The hotel has great facilities that include computers with free internet access and a laundry room. Its a good 20 minute walk to the nearest metro but its not an unpleasant walk. There are a few restaurants and a big supermarket close by. My only criticism of this hotel is that the breakfast sometimes fell short of the other high standards. If you are an early bird then the food is hot and plentiful but for the last hour of service the staff have a tendancy to let the food go cold and stop replacing things. Sep 26 2009 	Good hotel	I enjoyed my stay at this hotel. The only things that I did not like is if you went to breakfast around 7:30am instead of 6:30am it made it vary difficult to find a seat to eat and the food goes quick so you would have to wait till they bring out new trays of food. I also found that the hotel was pretty far from most places and I found it pretty difficult to get taxis some nights. The nearest subway station was about 25-30 minutes away. Aug 25 2009 	Great value for money helpful staff	Stayed 3 nights in August 2009 (bad month to visit Beijing, its too hot!!). The hotel is either new or has undergone extensive renovations recently, so the rooms are in a really good condition. The free WiFi is fast and easy - both, my laptop and my phone connected without a hitch. They also have free internet terminals (I think there are 8 of them) for guests to use.The breakfast spread is OK, though not great. The one big problem is a strange smell in the rooms - apparently they have some sort of sanitation issue. However, since we hardly spent time in the room, thats was bearable. Also, the hotel is far from the touristy bits of town (Forbidden City, the lake area etc.), but taxis in Beijing are cheap. However, as we found out, getting a cab suring rush hour can be quite an experience (we waited 45 minutes and walked a few miles before we got one willing to take us back to the hotel one evening).The best part about the hotel is the staff, especially Mike the Operations Manager - flexible and anticipating guest requests and fulfilling them quickly. Even housekeeping did quite a good job. There was another friendly woman at the front desk, but I forget her name.On the whole, really good value for money, considering it is an Express by Holiday Inn. Aug 24 2009	Great Value for money	I've checked into the Holiday Inn Express - Temple of Heaven after staying in the Westin Beijing, Financial Street for 2 nights - and i didn't feel like i've been banished to some dodgy hotel (that's a good sign). Don't expect a bellboy to bring your luggage - do it yourself. That's why the hotel is able to give u the damn fantastic rates for the room nights WITH breakfast included. the Great Room is the in-house restaurant. I'v ordered a Sweet &amp; Sour pork rice &amp; a Kungpow Chicken Rice @ RMB$38 each. Pricey by Chinese standards, but it's a quick fix and is tasty. Comes with fruits and a bowl of soup. Yummy. Breakfast is not too bad. (I am not a fussy person). THe locality is in a suburb area - so its relatively safe. I don't feel like i have to watch my back when i am walking back. Also, there are rows of small eateries about a 7mins walk if you want to try the local food, along the walk to the Temple of Heaven. I've tried this restaurant, &quot;Hangzhou Eatery&quot; (With a red signboard) and it's run by a couple from Zhejiang province. Their speciality is their dumpling (served till around 8pm) and buns (only in the morning). Do try it. It's really yummy - and i've tried Crystal Jade, Din Tai Feng's before, and not that i haven't had the best..so this is good &amp; cheap. All in all, the Holiday Inn Express Temple of Heaven may be not that convenient or near a train station, but it's comfortable and it feels like going home.. Aug 19 2009 	budget hotel good value for money	It was a bit difficult to locate the hotel since some taxi drivers are unfamiliar with it. But make sure that you have the hotel write the address in Mandarin and mark the location in the map, this will be very helpful. Via taxi, it is 20 mins away from Wangfujang shopping street (because of the traffic) and 20-30 mins away from the Forbidden City. and 5-10 mins from the Temple of Heaven. The rooms are not that big but not cramped. It has all basic toiletries including slippers. No minibar/fridge though. The bed and pillows gave me a good night sleep. However, some construction seemed to be ongoing during the day so it would be a bit difficult to sleep in during the day. Staff are nice but there were only 2 people manning the reception desk, and no one to carry the bags. Breakfast was not so good but I guess this was expected for the price.Also, I was lucky enough to discover a local market nearby where you can buy fruits, vegetables at non-tourist prices (i.e. 1kg peaches for 1.5 yuan). Aug 17 2009 	Great value pleasant stay am going again	My first tip is have the address written in Chinese and explain where it is located. It is new and most taxi drivers are not familiar with the location although it is near the Temple of Heaven.Breakfast is buffet and has a big variety. Go early if there are groups staying there. Can change money at the desk. Make sure money is in excellent shape or it will be refused.The room is comfortable and internet access is free. Computers are in a couple of areas but I always carry mine for convenience. Explore the neighborhood if you have time, There is a hutong nearby that we enjoyed visiting. You can walk to Hongqaio market and there is a new market next to it that is good to visit. Hongqaio is good for pearls and knockoffs. For pearls of good quality go to Josephine on 4th floor. I have dealt with her for 8 years and she is very honest. Feel safe to have her mail things. There is a noodle place across the street from Hongqaio and it is a lot of fun.People at Holiday Inn express are young but very capable and attend to whatever you need. I liked this place better than the 5 stars I have stayed in there. No refrigerator in the room which was not a big deal for us. Rooms are quite. I am staying there again leaving for China tomorrow. Aug 17 2009 	Good Value	We stayed in this hotel from 7 August for about 7 nights. The room was clean and modern. It is really value for money. We booked the room at about RMB200++ per night inclusive of 2 breakfast when they were having the &quot;Asia On Sale&quot; Promotion. Although the hotel is a bit out of the city centre, however, the public transports are very conveniently access to most of the places and attractions. There is a bus stop near the hotel. You may take the bus no. 102 directly to the Zoo at RMB1.00 per trip. Besides that, you may also take bus no. 102 to the &quot;XuanWuMen&quot; station (subway line 2) which can bring you to most of the places that can access by the subway....If you are coming from the Beijing International Airport, you may take a shuttle bus from Airport terminal (which will cost you about RMB16 / pax) to Xidan and from there to take a taxi to the hotel will cost you about RMB20.If you are taking taxi all the time, please inform the driver that the hotel is in Nanwei Road in stead of the hotel name as most of the driver are not familiar with the hotel name. You may also tell them the name of the hotel but must inform them it is at Nanwei Road as the driver may bring you to the Holiday Inn Temple of Heaven instead.Please do a lot of homework if you are intend to explore Beijing yourself by the cheapest way as the reception are not so helpful in giving direction and they will only ask you to take taxi. (Probably, they are not so familiar with the public transport system)Overall, it was a good experience. Jul 22 2009 	Great location for local sights but problems with the room and service	Could have been a lot better really - the service was just average with difficulty understanding English. We took 2 rooms as they couldn't accomodate all 4 of us in one room and our room was a bit smelly - terrible view of a building site and lots of rubbish and then our air con broke down the last night (but while we were asleep) so we woke up all hot and bothered. Having said all that - the location is great - very close to the Temple of Heaven and the Pearl market (if you take a rickshaw back make sure the price is negotiated up front - we did this and they still wanted 40 euro!?? yeah right!) and if you walk the opposite direction there is a yoshinora and a large park. Jul 20 2009 	Good value. Located in good proximity to bus line bank nearby restaurants	Very reasonable pre-paid rate.Arrived late into PEK, took taxi to hotel for 130Y (got Yuan from exchange in airport). Taxi no problem - I had everything in Chinese characters and had a google map just in case -The driver used both. The hotel desk clerk spoke English and was very efficient with check-in. I told her friends were arriving by train at 6am and asked if their rooms could be available when they got in - they were able to check-in early with no issue and she grouped our rooms together on the same floor. I did note there were several tour buses at the hotel. European groups: French and Italian. A very nice group.Breakfast Buffet 630a-10a was PLENTIFUL: juices, coffee, cereals, fruit, congee, salad, noodles (lo mein), rice, vegetables, bread, eggs and meat. Very nice staff. There are neighborhood restaurants, convenience stores and street vendors very close (walk). Room: Clean / Simple, typical US Holiday Inn Express with a slightly smaller room/bath. Beds are a bit hard, but the pillows and linens were nice quality. Hairdryer a nice feature. There is no alarm clock, bring your own or ask for a wake-up call. Plenty of outlets (chinese). 42&quot; flat screen English and Chinese channels should you have the time to watch. Good water pressure. Windows open if desired. Climate control worked well.Wake-up Calls and Taxi: They record these requests manually in a notebook - but they executed each time - quite nice. Had a taxi to the airport back and the driver arrived 30min early - we were ready for him. When we left - the desk clerk didn't spoke very, very little English - which was okay as we needed nothing other than to say we are checking out - he happily said &quot;OK.&quot;Internet: Free Internet, 6 workstations I think and WIFI.Vending machine in lobby. Jul 18 2009 	no fridge	great hotel , free buffet for breakfast, limited items for the restaurant, good staff, free computer for tourist, cosy room with satellite tv and cheap for beijing. great value. my only complaint is no mini fridge, strange ...... how could any modern hotel not have a mini fridge , its very hot in july and if u want a cold drink u need to got to the lobby to get a drink from the soda machine. hard to imagine what they were thinking when the built the place. be sure to take a hotel business card with the address for cabs. there is a IGA store down the street with any type of drink or grocery u need. restaurants are everywhere within a block or 2. the value is very good with this hotel Jul 15 2009 	Cant be better lol	That was my first time to live in the Holiday Inn Express Hotel. The room i was living in was clean and luxurious. I could also smell the natural scent from the lobby. The service was helpfull, so I really enjoyed the trip in Beijing. Everything was awesome, the people, the service, the environment and the food. I will go there again next time I visit Beijing. Jul 2 2009 	Good Value	We booked the hotel directly at the Holiday Inn website. While the location wasn’t the best, we still booked this hotel because of the buy 2 get 1 free promotion going on!Anyway, it’s only a short cab ride to Hepingmen or Qianmen subway stations, Tiananmen Square, etc. It's 700 meters from Temple of Heaven, we went there by cab as well. It's easy to hail a cab from the hotel and they are not expensive. The room was well appointed with a queen size bed and a sofa. Breakfast was free and adequate. There are 5 computers free for use at the 2nd floor by the breakfast area.We consider the hotel a good value for the price, even without the promotion. Jun 21 2009 	Good hotel a good 25min drive away from shopping	We stayed two very comfortable nights at this hotel on the south side of Beijing. Hotel was really nice and clean and reception staff was very helpful when checking in and when we needed a taxi.We had a room next to the elevators so we did hear sounds at night after closing the tv which was not so nice but not a bog problem.The biggest problem I had was the breakfast --&gt; it was horrible to us being scandinavian and used to smorgasbord style breakfast !Taxi from the hotel to the Silk Market was very cheap; only 25 yuan ! Free internet was a superb surprise ! May 29 2009 	Good deal but average hotel	Beijing has such a wide selection of hotels, it's hard to decide where to stay. This hotel offers 1 of the best deals as it's a HolidayInn Express, with free internet &amp; B'fast. Room is great but the reception staff is not efficient nor helpful. When I arrive, the girl standing at the reception didn't know how to check in for us! 5 mins later, another staff came by to help us out. This hotel is not near to any subway station but one can take a cab to WangFujing or the main train station for 20rmb. Temple of Heaven, TianQiao Acrobatics theatre and TianQian cultural theatre (where one can catch international troupes performing SwanLake, dances) are within walking distance. HongQiao Pearl market &amp; the famous RoastDuck Restaurant QuanJuDe Main branch are within 10 min cab ride. For the price, it's a great deal for groups who have their own transport to ferry them everywhere. For individuals, be prepared to pay for cab rides to get around.Alternative for individuals, consider Novotel XinQiao, slightly more expensive but no free b'fast. However the subway station is just right there with lots of other shops n' restaurants nearby. May 19 2009 	Holiday Inn Express Temple of Heaven was a good value and a good find.	We stayed at the Holiday Inn Express Temple of Heaven and it was a newly constructed wester style hotel. It was very clean, had high speed internet at no extra charge, a walk in glass shower, and they provided us with a free hot western style breakfast every morning, also had chinese style food. The staff was very helpful and professional and the hotel had a room dedicated as a laundry facility with washers and driers, iron and ironing board, and washroom and a big screen tv. The dailey rates were also very reasonable. We liked the hotel very much and give it a very high recommendation. May 14 2009 	Wouls stay here again	My family, wife and 9. y.o. son, stayed here for a week, we'd stay again if we return to Beijing. The rooms were clean &amp; modern, only complaint was with the shower nozzle spraying water everywhere, no big deal. Staff was wonderful, free breakfast buffett was very good, get there either early or late to get a table, the room fills up with guests going on bus tours. Free internet on 7 different hotel computers. This is a quiet residential area, good for sleeping, taxis are easy to hail and only cost about $2US to go downtown to the Forbidden City, etc. Take a card or map from the hotel with Chinese characters for the name of the hotel to show taxi drivers for for your return trip, they don't speak English. Before you get in the taxi to go back, make sure they nod to show you they know where the hotel is, about 50% didn't. In fact, show them the Chinese characters for wherever you want to go.For a great cheap massage, cheaper even than downtown, exit the hotel, make a left and go the end of the street, 1 block. Turn right, go about 100 meters, there is a hair salon on the left. After walking around wonderful sites, parks and hutongs all day, a 1 hour foot massage for $7US is incredible! May 7 2009 	Clean New Rooms but so-so service	Stayed 3 nights. Surprised to see new/ modern/ clean rooms. Staff were not friendly except for one receptionist. Since this is Holiday Inn Express, we got free breakfast and free internet! Good value for money. Breakfast selection is good, except that the menu doesn't change much every day. You get the same food everyday except for one or two. Location is a bit far from downtown but taxis help make up for it. Place is exceptionally quiet which is a big plus! Walking to the hotel from Temple of Heaven takes about 10 minutes. Apr 23 2009 	Long way from the sights	Adequate hotel but be prepared to walk long distances or use taxis to get anywhere, no subway stations close by but a nice quiet residential street. Reception staff were poor. Rooms were good size and breakfast was very good with a mixture of chinese and western options, so good value altogether. Apr 18 2009 	clean comfortable reliable - a pleasant surprise	we stayed at the Holiday Inn Express, Temple of Heaven for 3 nights whilst visiting Beijing. Located in a quiet residential area, taxis were easy to get and Central Beijing was at most 20 minutes away (depending on traffic). The rooms were comfortable, clean, recently refurbished. Reception staff were generally helpful. Breakfast was fresh and more than adequate. I would definitely recommend this hotel - very good value for money. Apr 14 2009 	Not fancy but great value for the money	We found the service and staff at this hotel to be very good. The hotel has been recently renovated and our room was very clean and modern. High speed internet and a buffet breakfast were included in the price of the room. The breakfast buffet was good,though not a large selection of food. Laundry facilities are also available at the hotel and were very clean and reasonably priced. Although a little tucked away, the hotel is a cheap cab ride to just about anywhere you'd like to go. Mar 22 2009 	Pleasant 	I stayed at the Holiday Inn Express on Nanwei Road &amp; was pleasantly surprised. The staff here were so friendly &amp; very helpful. Despite the hotel being a little out of the way &amp; I'm use to walking lots in every city I visit, Beijing without a doubt is massive so take a taxi to most places or to the nearest metro. Both are cheap....The hotel is very competitively priced &amp; is a nice walk to the temple of heaven. It's only 35 minutes walk to Tiananmen Square. Rooms were clean, modern etc.....I can only see this hotel getting better &amp; better...I hope to return. Mar 18 2009 	Good value for money	This hotel was clean, the staff was friendly and very helpful. The menu selections were limited but there were local restaurants close by. The rooms were very clean and the facilities were adequate if you are like us who don't need a fancy hotel since we are out all day anyway. Feb 16 2009 	Great hotel	Before we left for China, I did a lot of research on hotels and attractions. The hotel choices in Beijing is staggering--so many choices! Many hotels seemed to have issues with cleanliness so when I finally made reservations, I decided to go with brand names I was familiar with and the choice for Beijing was this hotel.The hotel staff was very helpful. We arrived early in the morning after taking an overnight train from Xi'an. Our rooms (2) were both ready. We were scheduled to go to the Great Wall early the next morning and before we even checked in, we had arranged for breakfast and a bag lunch for the next day--and the wireless was working on my mobile device as well. We were also invited to get breakfast for that day. When we returned later that day, our train tickets for the next part of our journey were delivered during the day and were waiting for us at the desk.The rooms were both better than expected--very clean and well appointed. The bathroom was great. We had been in Tibet for two weeks and had very poor experiences in one hotel in particular so this was very welcome. The location was fine. It is a fair distance from the subway station but with the location near the Temple of Heaven, it was easy to give directions to the taxi drivers to find the hotel (our son speaks enough Mandarin to get by), and there were plenty of taxis in the area. The breakfast was very good with a mix of western and local choices. Overall, we enjoyed our stay here very much. Oct 6 2008 	New Clean Convenient	The holiday inn express is everything it promises. A new hotel, clean rooms, clean sheets, no nonsense service, dependable buffet breakfast ... you get what you pay for - a good choice if you want to avoid more expensive places in BJ.Its location however, is not very convenient if you plan on using public transport. The nearest subway needs a taxi (probably 15-20mins walk). Sep 18 2008	At the right price a good value choice	I also stayed at this property during the Olympics (it was also a good deal using Priorityclub points).The previous review is very accurate. But my perspective is slightly different. I'm giving it 4 stars based on VALUE. Assuming you can get a room here for about US$60, it's a good comparative choice. The hotel has what you NEED. About 7 free internet terminals (another luxury hotel in Beijing charged me a quarter a minute!), an excellent free breakfast with many Western options, and a self-serve laundry room (very rare in China, and very convenient). The rooms are modern and nice (although my bathroom had that occasional mild sewer smell). The map location shown on the Holiday Inn website is wrong (or at least was wrong last month). The hotel is about 5 blocks west of the west entrance to the Temple of Heaven. Not much of great interest to tourists in the immediate neighborhood (other than the Temple of Heaven). No easy subway access, but the location in convenient by taxi to the city center, and taxis are very cheap. If you don't mind relying on taxis, you will find the location to be pretty good. Sep 7 2008 	Affordable option during the Olympics	At a rate of 939 CNY per night, this was one of the only moderately priced hotels available during the Olympics. The daily breakfast buffet increased the value of the rate. The buffet featured Western dishes (bacon, scrambled eggs and sausage) as well as a few Chinese options (fried rice and bok choy). The hotel also serves lunch and dinner, but has a very limited menu of a few Chinese entrees. The hotel opened just a few days before we arrived, so the staff was still getting the hang of some things. However every request was handled with a smile and earnest effort. The front desk staff was able to give us information on arranging a tour to the Great Wall. The rooms were comfortable with a modern decor. My room got a thorough cleaning daily, but as I was out all day most days I don't know how long it took for housekeeping to come around.One of my travel companions had plumbing problems with his room, but was moved to a room that didn't have any issues. The whole neighborhood seems to having sewage issues, as a horrible odor sometimes came out of the gutters and pipes. The neighborhood seems to be going through some gentrificaiton. While we were there an IGA supermarket opened down the street and a coffee shop was on the opposite corner from the hotel. The neighborhood felt safe but was a little blighted with a vacant lot across from the hotel.The hotel is walking distance to the Temple of Heaven, but not centrally located to many other tourist attractions. Despite claims of being close to the subway, it's about a 30 minute walk to the Hepingmen station. However, it's a very short cab ride to the Tiananmen Square, Forbidden City and the Wangfujing Shopping area. We relied on cabs for the majority of our transportation. The hotel staff helped us immensely by writing our destinations in Chinese to give to the taxi drivers. (We also had to be sure to have the hotel address in Chinese for our return ride. Since it was a new hotel, no one was familiar with it). The Hongqiao Pearl Market is on the east side of the Temple of Heaven, which was about a 25 minute walk from the hotel. The Yuan Long Silk Store is also close to the market. A branch of the popular restaurant for Peking roast duck called Quanjude is next to Hepingmen station. A McDonald's is about a 15 minute walk from the hotel on the way to the subway. There aren't a lot of other options around for Western meals. All and all it was an adequate stay for budget travel. Good for bargain hunters, but not very convenient for tourists. Pros: price, free broadband internet, friendly staff, complimentary bottled water, lcd tvCons: location, thin walls, shower w/o tub, no irons or alarm clocks in rooms, plumbing odor Nov 1 2009 	Hotel genial joya escondida Sep 13 2009 	Schönes Hotel zu einem guten Preis Aug 4 2009 	hotel agréable Jan 23 2009	?????????? Dec 31 2008 	?????"
"Jul 29 2009 	A Reasonably Good Place to Stay	The hotel is close to the airport - a 20 minute taxi ride. I agree with another reviewer, taxi drivers do not know where it is - even though I had the name of the hotel and address in Chinese. The hotel is not too far from the sites if you take public transport, and even using taxis is not that expensive. See my tips.The room was a good size with a firm bed, crisp linen, great pillows and a good bathroom. The shower floor was a little mouldy in places and a tile was cracked but the shower-rose was the largest I have ever seen and, coming from a country where water restrictions have been in place for quite a while, I felt somewhat guilty at the amount of water emitted from the shower. However, I soon succumbed to the decadence of long luxuriant hot showers!The room has a flat-panel TV, bar fridge and clock-radio with an iPod dock.The hotel is above Focus Mall - an upmarket shopping mall and across the road from a shopping plaza - Stellar International Cineplex - which has approx 20 restaurants, a liquor store and a Department Store which has a Supermarket on the ground floor.The hotel staff are efficent, although they cannot speak English very well, so getting directions anywhere can be difficult but not impossible. The breakfast was fine - usual Asian style and also some concession to Western tastes. Coffee is extaordinarily expensive everywhere in China, so use the little automatic coffee machine in the restaurant for your caffiene blast for the day....it doesn't taste too bad.The hotel has 2 PCs in the lobby which allow free internet access however they are often occupied. In the restaurant on the 5th floor where breakfast is held, there is another 2 PCs, not often used....so just go there.Overall, I would recommend this Hotel as I was pleased with the cleanliness and general location.TIPS: If you want to get to Tian anmen Square and the Forbidden City using public transport, it will take approx an hour but only cost 6 yuan round trip! Ask at the Front Desk - their tour co-ordinator will provide a map of the city and give you directions. It involves one bus ride and two train changes. Worth the experience.If you want to go to the Summer Palace - and you should not miss this fantastic place - catch a taxi. It will only cost 50-60 yuan each way and is well worth the money when you see just how far the journey is. It is approx a 25 minute ride. It is usefull to have the various attractions you wish to visit written in Chinese so that you can simply show the text to some unsuspecting local and get directions if you are lost. Also useful for the taxi drivers. Remember, almost NO ONE speaks any English.I booked a Great Wall tour through the hotel because I couldn't be bothered booking on the net - however, you can save approx 150 yuan by booking on the net. Go to the Mutianyu section - it is a longer trip there but absolutely spectacular. The hotel arranged tour spent only 2 hours at the Wall - not nearly enough time. If you can afford it, hire a car for a day....approx 600 yuan.The Supermarket in the Stellar complex has everything you need and also has a small pharmacy. It also sells cold beer at 1.5 yuan and different wines. Nov 12 2008 	Excellent Hotel	It's a brand new, clean hotel with modern furniture and amenities. It's perfect for someone who is transitting in Beijing, as it is very close to the airport. It's situated near a large shopping center, but other than that, there is not much within walking distance. The only down side is that not many taxi drivers seem to know where the hotel is, even with a map written in Chinese. All of my taxi drivers on 3 separate occasions did not know where the hotel was, and had to call the hotel for directions. Breakfast is excellent. Sep 7 2008 	Nice new hotel	This was a new hotel, It opened 10 days before i arrived. The room was nice, comfortable bed, nice new linens. Flat screen TV, in room safe. Incuded in the price was a breakfast to order.My only complaint was that one of the two elevators would sometimes come to an abrupt stop on the ninth floor. Not a good feeling since I was on the 18th.Also free internet. Aug 19 2008 	Great value during Beijing Summer Olympics	Unlike most of other hotels in Beijing with sky-rocking prices during Summer Olympics, Holiday Inn Express Wangjing offered very reasonable price during summer 2008.The hotel was brand new and just opened in early August. The front desk seemed not familar with the checkin procedure and was very slow and made some mistakes with our reservation, but we ended up with a very nice room on the 17th floor - new, modern, and big (rooms with ending with &quot;10&quot; are the bigger ones). Free internet in room and public areas. Free and tasty breakfast. Excellent service from housekeeping and restaurant staff.Since the hotel is new, most of the taxi drivers don't know where it is. It is located next to Hua Tang Shopping center (with many restaurants). Taxi to Olympic stadiums cost about 20-25 CNY. Sep 21 2009 	?????????????????????"
"Nov 25 2009 	Nice Hotel for Beijing but Not 5 Stars!!	On arrival into the spacious driveway of the Holiday Inn, Temple of Heaven, it is easy to be impressed. This is the most modern looking building within blocks of the area. The front lobby is very large and open but is not inviting. The staff at the front desk are very attentive but do not speak anything close to conversation level English. My wife and I received our room of two twin beds, which we had been advised about when we booked our tour package. The room was located on the fourth floor and was very spacious. The beds were spaced out far enough apart so that we were not crammed. The room had a small bathroom but large walk in shower. The bay window overlooked a bustling Beijng Street. A window seat made it nice to sip wine or beer and take in the local atmosphere without hacking up a lung in the smog. The only knock I had about the room was that the heat was always on, even when we attempted to turn off the heat, and even turn on the air condition, the room was like an oven. Granted, the temperature outside was 45 degrees farenheight, the room was very warm. The beds were comfortable for twins, and the television had the standard CNN/Headline News, HBO Asia (which is in English and shows Western movies like Lethal Weapon,) and ESPN. The Business Center does charge to check email 10 Yuen for 10 minutes and there is a grocery store directly across the street. Be forewarned we were told by our private tour guide NOT to walk the streets of the area after dark as the neighborhood is less than desireable. However, we were in walking distance of the impressive Temple of Heaven, and an easy cab ride to Tiannmen Square and the Forbidden City. Our room rate came with a daily breakfast buffet which served American and Chinese food. The buffet was excellent our first day and below average the second day but free is free. A very nice no frills no thrills hotel, but we had a very comfortable stay Nov 1 2009 	Comfortable hotel but the service needs improvement	The hotel is very nice, clean and comfortable. We really enjoyed our room. The service on the other hand is another matter. They wer not helpful and borderline lied to us. for example, we asked the staff where we could find the closest laundromat or dry cleaner and they didn't know of any and suggested that we use theri sevice. After a quick stroll in the neighborhood, we discovered a few, including one right across the street. Besides that, they had menus with diffrent prices and tried to over charge us. The breakfast buffet was very dissapointing for $15. We ordered a la carte one morning to have the staff use the eggs and bacon directly from the buffet and not cook it up fresh. The rooms were well priced, but everything else they have ther is way overpriced. Oct 20 2009	Seafood buffet - tremendous	Yes this is a chain hotel but it provides all you need for a short stay - good beds, bathrooms and breakfasts - actually the breakfasts wre excellent and the staff very attentive. The dinner buffets were superb too - and excellent value. Sep 13 2009 	Still lovely	Not much too say,,,still lovely hotel..stayed in room 1501 on 15:th floor this time between 30august-5 september..This was our 2.nd stay at this hotel, and have nothing to complain about this time either.Read our 1:st review from April to find out what we liked. Jan 21 2009 	Good Value and clean rooms	Having read the various reviews we decided that this would meet our needs. We chose the business rooms, which are located on the 14th floor. Both our rooms were upgraded as one had a faulty thermostat and one the lock on the door was faulty. We were very pleased with our new rooms which had more space and were very clean. We chose to eat breakfast in the hotel on one occassion. They had a good selection of food but a little pricey. A 10 minute walk takes you to the metro and a slightly longer walk will get you to the Temple of Heaven.The staff were always helpful with taxi directions and writing places in Mandarin for the drivers. It was a pleasant experience especially as it didn't break the bank!! I would recommend this hotel but take a business plus room to enjoy it to the fullest.Diana Guangzhou/UK Nov 11 2008 	Nice room but sterile place	I chose this as a low hassle starting point for my trip to china. It lies in a reasonably central location and is about 10 mins from a line 5 underground station. Probably 15 min walk to the temple of heaven park. The hotel's situation is quite nice, pretty quiet area - not particularly touristy at all.The room was comfortable and of a decent size with a nice powerful shower - albeit a slightly stale shower curtain.The lobby is a bit of an empty cavern and the evening buffet dinner expensive, tired and uninspiring. Breakfast, while quite pricey was good though.There was a bit of a buzz upstairs in the KTV karaoke lounge - but these are private booths and being a lone traveller i didn't hang around long. Taxis cost a shade over 100RMB to and from the airport. It is possible to take the metro and this might be advisable if travelling alone at peak hours since the roads get quite clogged. Oct 30 2008 	Thanks to tripadvisor I get this fine hotel	I was looking for a hotel in Beijing for a 4 night stay at about $100s and found good reviews for this hotel at tripadvisor. I was not deceived! We got a realy nice room, the staff was very professional and the breakfeast was very good. Even if the location is not very central, a 10 minutes walk to the subway station put you everywhere in Beijing. The only point is that smoking is allowed indoors, but it is not a problem specific for this hotel, this is China. Oct 17 2008 	Loved the Holiday Inn Temple of Heaven--Again!	In October of 2008, I stayed once again at the Holiday Inn Temple of Heaven hotel in Beijing. This was my third stay, and I was very pleased, as usual. I stayed on the executive floor for about $100/night and considered it to be a very good deal. Although the hotel does not do a very good job of publicizing it, all executive floor rooms come with an excellent free buffet breakfast, a laundry allowance sufficient to clean a pair of pants and shirt daily, up to six free juices or local soft drinks from the mini-bar, and free coffee, tea and soft drinks all day long in the very pleasant executive lounge. There are also snacks and two free alcoholic drinks daily available in the executive lounge, but only during a designated happy hour period. All in all, I found my hotel experience to be top notch. The room was very clean, the bed linens (and towels, to a slightly lesser extent) were of good quality, and the housekeeping staff did a good job. The concierge staff was very helpful and friendly and the front desk clerks were efficient and pleasant. The employees in the hotel restaurants were particularly customer-oriented--after specially requesting pineapple at the breakfast buffet on my second morning at the hotel, I found it delivered without fail to my table for each subsequent breakfast. In addition, once the staff learned that my sister and traveling companion had a bad cold, they specially fixed her ginger tea and ginger in hot Coca Cola (an established and trusted Chinese cold remedy, apparently) and delivered it to our table. This hotel is really a gem. I will say that my executive floor room was considerably nicer than the one standard room that I visited during my time at the hotel, so I would recommend spending the extra money to upgrade. The location of the hotel may not be the most central, but with the new subway station nearby, it is really easy to access other parts of the city. I found the subway station to be a pleasant 10 minute walk from the hotel, and at 2 RMB per ride, it is a great bargain.Don't miss out on this great Beijing hotel! Oct 5 2008 	Decent Hotel Option	Altogether, the experience you get at this hotel is what you would expect. The service was fine and the rooms were clean and by-the-book. The only real downside was the ludicrously high charge to use the internet in the business center - the worst I experienced during my two weeks in China. The location wasn't amazing, but it's only a 10 minute walk to the nearest subway station, and it should be noted the Beijing subway system is top-notch, so you'll be able to get anywhere you want to go fairly quickly from there. Sep 21 2008 	Great Value	This hotel is a very good value for Beijing. Like everywhere we went in china, though, it was a good value because it wasn't too close to anything. the nearest metro stop was about 4 blocks away. we always managed to find a good pastry shop along the way to the metro. Very clean rooms. They gave us as many complimentary water bottles as we wanted. I would definitely stay here again if i went back to china, despite the location. the staff also was very helpful in telling us how to get to every attraction. Sep 8 2008 	Really liked the HI Temple of Heaven	Very nice hotel. Clean and well appointed. Good facilities. Desk staff spoke very good english. Silver-service in their dining areas. Loved the breakfast! Family friendly. Kids loved the heated pool... although we had to purchase a swim cap (AU$9 each!) Great value for money. Although expect it to be a good half hr drive to where most tourists stay and shop. Cheap taxi's though! Jun 29 2008 	Excellent Hotel	I have just spent 5 days in Beijing staying in this hotel. My family and myself is very happy with this hotel. I will say this is one of the best hotels I experience. First of all, all the staff (reception, restaurant, doorman, even the lady that clean the room) are very friendly, polite and helpful. My daughter got sick on the last day we were there, not only they recommend the hospital that suit our need, they also extend my check out time for two hours so that I can handle the situation comfortably. Frankly saying, I think their service attitude is the best that I have experienced in any country. Everybody work there has very good attitude!!!This hotel has all the facility you will need on a touring trip or business trip. The room is not really fancy but still roomy, clean and comfortable. It has great value and the kids eat free. I especially like the buffet breakfast that they supply. It has both Chinese and Western food and the quality of the food is very good. My kids grow up in Canada and I don’t have to worry about finding food that fit their diet.I saw some of the reviewer complain about the location. It is a normal residential area for Beijing resident. It is perfectly safe. I personally like this location because I can go to the grocery to buy local snack and bottle water and not paying the premium of the tourist location. I also find a store that sell excellent local pastry. There is also local dry and wet cleaner that can wash the clothing at a very reasonable price (5 RMB/clothing, underwear is done by weight).I realize this hotel is not in the main tourist area. I went downtown where all the action is twice during my visit. Beside that, all the other tourist area is on the outskirt. When I don’t have to go downtown, I avoid getting there. If you saw the traffic jam of the downtown area, you will understand why I prefer not going there. I cannot imagine going through that traffic everyday if I live there. Since I have two young kids, I am not looking for party every night.I am sure that I will go back to this hotel on my next visit. Jun 15 2008 	Holiday Inn Temple of Heaven- Great value	I stayed at the Holiday Inn- Temple of Heaven at the beginning of June 08 and was pleasantly surprised at how nice of a hotel it was. The lobby is very nice, the staff great and the rooms while not overly large where very clean. I didnt find its location bad at all. Close to the Temple of Heaven and the Pearl Market. Cab rides to other places where also very reasonable. Overall, for the price I thought it was a very good value especially with the included breakfast. Apr 18 2008	Amazing hotel amazing experience	The Holiday Inn - Temple of Heaven is by far the best Holiday Inn chain hotel I have ever visited. Unlike HIs in the United States and Canada, the hotel has amazing concierges, friendly staff, spacious rooms and halls, and new furnishings and decorations. The staff was helpful with writing out the chinese characters for all the places we were going, and helped us out getting Z-line trains to Xian with little effort. Furthermore, while the breakfast may be overpriced to some travelers, you have the ability to order a-la-carte, thus having a 5-6 USD breakfast. Overall, the service is what sets this hotel apart. Jan 5 2008	Great place to stay !	We booked this hotel through a travel agent, total 9 of us, we enjoyed the stay, the rooms are very comfortable, clean and quiet, the buffet was excellent. You can find anything you can have in Canada. Plus it is in a residential area, you can simply walk to a cornor store to pick up some drink/beers.The service was nice, since we join the local tour, we always were picked up from the hotel, so the location seem perfect for us. We definitely recommend to our friends. Jan 3 2008	Clean place	My wife and I stayed in this hotel and also at the Holiday Inn in Shanghai (which is much, much better). The rooms were clean, the staff polite and friendly. A woman in the business center was particularly helpful. The breakfast buffet was good. Plus, we got to see how people live since it's in a residential area. Go out for a morning walk and you'll see all sorts of interesting stuff -- including people carrying birds in cages (they are taking the birds out for a change in scenery!). Oct 27 2007	A nice Surprise from a picky traveller	I usually stay at a 5-star property (China World or Grand Hyatt) but I'm here for just one week on business and didn't need the extra ammenities or price. I reluctantly booked this hotel after reading other reviews and was very pleasantly surprised! The lobby is large and modern, and the location is not bad depending on where you are going. The room (regular not club floor) is average size, good ammenities and a big plus for me...free broadband Internet access. The on-site Heavenly Cafe was also a big surprise great value and great service. My husband and I had 2 beers and 4 dishes for about $10. For regular Beijing travellers who are used to staying in hotels at the $150-250 range this is a welcome budget friendly hotel at 575rmb!. Aug 16 2007 	Excellent Value Hotel	I recently stayed here for 3 nights. I also stayed at the Holiday Inn Central Plaza on my recent visit to China and in comparison i was not disappointed with my stay here. I got what i consider a great room rate for a Suite Room. This included access to the Business Lounge and Breakfast was included.The hotel location is not central, but a short affordable taxi ride will take you to most sites in Beijing.I believe this Hotel is ideal for people visiting Beijing who would like to sample 'local' life. Stepping out of the Hotel you are in a local area and not the 'touristy' areas that most people only see and experience. There are plenty of small eating places and shops close by.My room was a little dated and would need upgraded, but for the cost of the room i consider it was good value for money. I am sure when they upgrade the hotel they will also upgrade the room rate.To conclude i would have no problem recommending this hotel, both for value for money and friendliness of the staff. Jun 1 2007 	Too expensive for remote location	The previous reviews mentioning the location were on the money, this place is remote. Without Chinese I think it would be impossible to get to/from this hotel. No taxi drivers knew the hotel even when I showed them the card, every driver had to call to get directions. Furthermore the traffic is so bad in Beijing that location is key. There are other international brands that have much better locations for the same price.The hotel itself is fine, the service is fine, the rooms are fine, the food is fine. Nothing great. My key complaint is the cost, it is simply too expensive for how average it is and how out of the way. May 24 2007 	Excellent Choice	My family and I stayed here for several nights while sightseeing in Beijing. The hotel is clean, the staff professional and the price a bargain (I booked at the Holiday Inn website). Although not in the center of the city, a taxi ride to Wangfujing costs only about 20 yuan (and there are plenty of taxis), and bus 803 goes directly there from a stop immediately behind the hotel for just 1 yuan. My children loved the fairly large indoor pool. The hotel's dinner buffet left something to be desired, but there are plenty of decent Chinese restaurants right out the door. I will definately stay here again when in Beijing. May 9 2007	Temple of Heaven Hotel (Holiday Inn) Beijing	the Temple of Heaven hotel is approximately 10 minutes drive south of the Temple of Heaven attraction. Its' located in a residential area but has a nearby supermarket (signposted outside the hotel) and restaurants within a few hundred yards. I don't know if the supermarket had any English speakers. The hotel facilities are of conference standard. The desk staff have enough english for their job but didn't seem able to deal with queries that weren't absolutely specific. I had a query about a phone message which was left for me. Even showing my piece of paper failed at first to elicit a reply: though I was impressed by the sudden decision to ring the mobile number on my paper for me. The two restaurants were *excellent* for their evening meals and also the breakfast menu which covered both western and Chinese foods.We had to have breakfast extra early a couple of times and the staff were willing to provide some dishes of both Western and Chinese at that hour. The staff were eagle eyed and attentive and as a visually impaired person they quickly remembered I needed a bit of help to carry my soup dishes to my table. None of the staff spoke fluent English by any means which may be a problem with the Olympics. My room was comfortable, though the smart card I had wasn't infallible by any means and I needed help from fellow guests once or two. Their smart card key had to be swiped down and it didn't seem to locate positively at all. One also has to be aware of 'turning on' the electronic lighting system on arrival. My UK guide failed to explain this to us : maybe its standard in Holiday Inn hotels and didn't need explaining, but I am a notice to hotels. Great idea to have small radios in the room. Reception was a little on the difficult side: even though I was listening to China Radio International whose studios are in BeiJing, though I did manage to live with the quality for the first 3 nights. On our return on the final night of our holiday we were in an 'annexe' and the radio reception was appalling.The TV really should have better instructions for its use. It seems to be that its assumed that everyone owns their own TV. Well, I don't and I had to ask one of my fellow travelling companions if there was any problem with reception because I had a real problem turning the set on. Once I did I was most impressed with the range of channels in Chinese and English language. The hotel shop had an interesting range of goods but the staff had minimal english skills even for their jobs. Considerably less than the desk staff. Apr 11 2007	Holiday Inn Temple of Heaven Beijing	My husband and I stayed at this hotel as part of our Classic China Tour with Travelscope (50 group members). The hotel was excellent, very clean, the rooms were very luxurious, and the staff were wonderful. I sent a fax to my mother (she is very deaf so it is my only way of communicating) and it was dealt with immediately and for a very low price. My laundry was handed in at 0800 and was returned, washed, ironed and on hangers at 4pm - again for a very reasonable price.I have to follow a gluten free diet, and breakfasts can be difficult, but I was spoilt for choice here, there was so much food of every variety on offer - I certainly did not feel hungry!!If I am ever lucky enough to go back to this wonderful city, I would definitely stay at this hotel again. Very very good value and very helpful friendly staff. Mar 31 2007 	great value excelent location	We stayed for only 50€ including breakfast, and for this money it is the best choice in Beijing. The hotel has a beautiful lobby and restaurant, very comfy and the room, although smallish is well apointed and nice.We also stayed at the Westin and the location of the Holiday Inn is much better. We went walking to the Temple of Heaven, about 20 min. through a very interesting street. It is also not far from the forbidden city and the silk market.It is more than enough if you are looking for a 5star without high-end luxus and service. Mar 3 2007 	Awesome but a little overpriced for a guy on a budget	This place was great. Biggest problem in China was finding people to understand english. This hotel had an abundance of workers that were able to help.Rooms were very clean and well stocked with everything you could want.It wasnt too far from most attractions, not far from the tennis centre. Taxi's are cheap anyway so you can get around.Unfortunately, compared to the dodgy places, this Hotel was very expensive. around $60 - $70 AUD a night. It was definately worth paying to have some staff who could speak English! Nov 8 2006 	Loved the Holiday Inn	We just got back from two weeks in China. We stayed about 4 nights at the Holiday Inn Temple of Heaven. It was hard to depart this hotel as the staff was so dedicated to making our stay as comfortable as possible. The hotel room was very clean and very well kept. We felt spoiled each time we got back to the hotel from a day out in the city with a very clean room and access to the reasonable priced 24/7 spa. The breakfast was full of various selections of western and eastern foods to the point that it felt as we had a feast each time we had breakfast. Overall, this hotel is one of the best hotels I’ve stayed for the price we paid. We liked the location as it was very close to the Forbidden City, and the temple of heaven. Another thing we liked about this hotel is that it was located within a neighborhood, which allowed us to get a taste of the everyday lives of the peoples in Beijing. This hotel made our stay in Beijing a memorable one. In fact, when we went on with our trip to other cities, we often talked about how wonderful our stay at the Temple of Heaven hotel was compared to the hotels we stayed in other cities. I would definitively recommend this hotel to others. Nov 7 2006	Horrible Location	The hotel is new and has a great breakfast buffet. The rooms are nice and it has cable with multiple english channels. HOWEVER, it was a horrible location. I was traveling with my mother and we had an extremely hard time finding a cab that would take back to the hotel from Central Beijing. Overall, I would not stay here again solely because of the location. Jul 9 2006	Touring with Teenagers	Just stayed in the hotel as part of a tour package. As the other reviewers said, this is an excellent value and great overall holiday. Not in the center of activity, but we were with a group of teenagers who didn't have far to stray as a result. Good facilities, free internet access and refreshing pool in the summer heat. May 9 2006	Great Hotel!	What great rooms I found at the Holiday Inn Temple of Heaven Bejing - at about $68 for a single on the Holiday Inn's website. It was less than the rate quotes direct from the hotel - but it's always great to check all options. It has everything I like when I travel including a decent health club, plus robe and slippers, coffee maker, free high speed internet, and it's bright because of the large windows. They also had a non-smoking floor. The bed was fairly comfortable and had a great silk comforter. Try to buy one when you are in China.The service from the hotel staff was impeccable and very friendly. The restaurant had a good buffet breakfast with everything including omelettes, fresh eggs to order, etc. The dinner buffet was fine - although we didn’t find a lot of great restaurants generally in China, unless you stay at a 5 star Western Hotel. Since we were picked up by the Tour Company, we found it fine for location. Not too far from the Pearl Market. Will absolutely stay there next time I am in Beijing. Jun 28 2005	Impressed	Extremely clean, neat and new!!! Excellent choice for the price and the staffs are extremely helpful. Food at the restaurants in the hotel are better than expected and very reasonably priced. The only downside is the location which is a little away from the city centre and half the time the taxi drivers do not know the exact location even with the map of the hotel. Nevertheless, I will recommend this hotel to anyone who wants a very comfortable and clean hotel room to go back to at the end of the day. I have stayed at a supposedly prestigious hotel nearer the city, it is nothing compared to this holiday inn which is at half the price. Jun 20 2005	Great place to stay!	We were very impressed with this hotel. The place is much nicerthan most Holiday Inns in the Usa. We were greated and assistedwith much care. The location is not the best but the hotel is great.We had a massage for $20. for 45 min. You cannot beat that!There are 3 restaurants. The breakfast buffet was plentiful.A variety of foods from different countries. The taxis are cheap toget to the pearl market. The Temple of Heaven is only a 15min walk.However, I do recommend to travel in a group as you are walkingthrough some areas that are a little scary. We did not have a welcomefeel as we walked through this area. We had a van take our group of 5to the great wall and ming tombs. We were disappointed because theydid not get an English speaking driver for us. So we could not get anydetails....wish we would have taken the English speaking tour instead.For the $75 a night we were very impressed Sep 23 2009 	Sehr empfehlenswertes Hotel in Peking May 10 2009 	Muy buen hotel Jan 18 2009 	????????

"Aug 5 2009 	Ok for a couple of nights	We were booked into this hotel by a tour guide with a link that showed it a 5 start hotel. Had we not expected a 5 start hotel we probably would have thought higher of this hotel. By American standards it is probably a 2-3 start hotel.We are well traveled Americans in Beijing for sight seeing and traveling with two tenage boys.1. The beds were hard but that was to be expected for Asia. We asked if they had a soft topper for the beds (some hotels have them for Western guests) but they did not.2. The bathroom was fine but the showers were stained from use.3. The towels were terrible...very soft but not cotton, you could not dry yourself! I ended up using the pillowcases!4.They had a flat screen TV but only one channel that was English speaking and it seemed to repeat itself a lot.5. Breakfast was good...lots of variety. You could get toast and butter!!6. They had free wi-fi in the lobby and they also had a computer you could use. Only problem was that it was in Chinese so you had to remember which buttons were yes and no.7. Not many Westerners there.8. Walls were thin...hear what our neighbors were doing.9. We could not comment on the location as we had our tour guide pick us up and drop us off in the morning and night.I know this all sounds negative but I like to know what I am getting myself into. If I went back to Beijing I would not stay at this hotel. I would look for a hotel that catered more to Westerners. We travel all over world and have been to China several times and from our own experience we like to come home to a comfortable hotel where you can relax. This was a hotel where you came back to sleep and shower (and drip dry). Jun 28 2009 	Good BUT BEWARE	This is a nice faciility, the rooms were clean and modern, that's about all it has going for it. The staff spoke limited English. The entire 3rd floor where the small gym is has the lights turned off when the gym is closed, as I found out when I couldn't sleep at 4AM. The breakfast is included but has the same food choices every day, I got tired of it after the 2nd day.BIG WARNING!!! They tried to get some more money out of me when I was checking out, said I broke a floor lamp. We went back into the room with the manager and the scummy looking bell hop said that the lamp shade was hanging off about to fall. I told them no way and stormed out of there. I'll see if this shows up on my VISA. They also tried to get some extra money from my tour guide saying he broke a wooden hanger.Oh, the hotel is also located a the end of a street where there is major building construction occuring, even into the night and early morning hours. Nothing like trying to sleep when there is a lot of machery buzzing around outside."
"Jul 21 2009 	Easy Access to Subway	Staying for 5 days in this hotel. Quite hard to find and taxi driver did not know where it is. Fortunately we meet a westerner who know where the hotel and we follow through his direction to the hotel.The hotel is near the subway station (sanyuanqiao) and the station is also ABC (airport beijing city) station. Therefore, easy access from the airport (the ABC train) and all over beijing city (subway).Some reception staffs can not speak english but they are helpful. Quick check in. Breakfast voucher must be collected at the front desk everyday. Breakfast is not that generous but worth the price.Overall nice and clean room. The bed is soft (compared to other hotels in China).You must take and collect your laundry by yourself at the front desk, they wont deliver it to your room.Since the food selection is not that great, we walk to the the Novotel Sanyuan Hotel just back-to-back with Ibis Sanyuan Hotel.There's no free mineral water in the room, so you'd better buy some to stock at your room.Free internet on the lobby! Jun 22 2009 	Great for Westerners	We were impressed with the friendliness of the staff and the cleanliness of the hotel. Even though we did not speak a word of Chinese, everyone was willing to accommodate us. We stayed for 8 days since the hotel is close by our daughter's apartment. There's a little Western grocery a short walk away, so if you're really craving some Oreos and candy, you can surely get them there. The room was bigger than we expected, at least bigger than some that we had in London. HBO was in English as well as a few other channels, but we were so busy seeing the sights that we didn't have time to do much else but collapse from our adventures. The hotel seems to be a bit away from the major attractions,but with the moderate price of the subway and the taxis, this was not a problem.We paid $42 a night and an additional $2.93 for breakfast, so the Ibis was a real bargain. The breakfast buffet was a Chinese breakfast, which we enjoyed. The hotel is located in Phoenix City, which appears to be an up and coming area of the city. We would definitely return to the Hotel Ibis Sanyuan. Apr 30 2009 	Just OK	We were really happy with the Ibis in Xian. We considered it the best value of the 2.5 weeks we spent in China, so we were hoping for the same standards at the Ibis in Beijing, but it fell short. The rooms were OK, but a bit worn for being such a new hotel. It opened last year. Worst parts were the lobby and hallyways and bar -- not clean and the bar always smoke-filled. There were q-tips and dental floss on the hallway carpets when we checked in and they were still there the next day. There is construction going on all around the hotel right now which makes coming and going difficult. Advantage is that it's around the corner from Line 10 subway stop which is convenient. Not too many good places to eat, but a few. Try the nearby Northern Village. Ask the hotel to direct you. This Ibis is convenient for coming and going to and from the airport, but that's about it. You could do much better location wise and it would be worth it to pay a little more to be in an area where there is more going on. Mar 5 2009 	Highly recommend for value cleanliness location	I would highly recommend this hotel for its location and if you are lookingfor a basic clean hotel without the extra frills. It is your typical Ibis hotel setup. It is very reasonably priced. My family and I stayed here in Jan. 2009 and paid approximately $200 RMB. When we checked in, they quoted us a higher price. But, once we told them we saw a lower price on the internet, they honored the lower price. This hotel is located in a great location for a stay in Beijing. It's located at the first stop (Sanyuanqiao) into the city from the airport train. This makes it very convenient for taking the train in and out of the airport. The subway stop is also right at the hotel. The subway system is so convenient that there's no need to pay the higher prices just to stay in the city center when this hotel offers the convenience of catching both the subway and the airport train. There's not much of anything around the hotel in terms of restaurants/shops, but with the convenience of the subway, it's easy to get to shops/food. At the time I was there, they were still building what looked to be a shopping/apartment complex next to it. I would definitely stay here again if I were to go to Beijing. Nov 13 2008	Good Value for Beijing next to subway	This is a new Ibis- one of many now being opened across China. Very good standard Ibis rooms, with queen size bed, desk in front of window and small wardrobe, timber style floor covering. Free internet in the room. International TV channels including BBC World, French TV NHK and HBO. Standard Ibis modular bathroom works very well. Its clean and with relatively soft bed (for China). The hotel is located on the 3rd ring road in Chayoang district not far from Sanlitun and Lufthansa center. There is nothing else in the vicinity, so you need to take the subway to get anywhere. The hotel is right next to the Sanyuanqiao subway station on the new line 10. Its also the first stop on the Airport Express train from Terminal 2 and 3 (which costs 25RMB). Subway is good and cheap (2RMB) and will get you anywhere easily including Olympic Park, Silk Alley market, and central sights (T Square). Beware of the steps from the Station if you are hauling luggage. Pick the right exit when you leave the station (its signposted in English). The Ibis is behind the Novotel. As of mid November the hotel was still not finished and the paving still had to be done outside the hotel. The room is good value (348RMB weekdays less weekends), but other things are pricey. There is no bottled water in the room and Evian is 25RMB in the bar. Other bar prices even worse. The breakfast is 20RMB but its not very good (much worse than Ibis Shanghai). Overall a very good choice for Beijing where other 3 star hotels are often not very good and 4 star hotels more expensive. Nov 1 2008	Work in progress	The inside is finished, but just barely -- the rooms still smell of paint and heat wasn't working properly. Outside, the street is still under construction, and it took half an hour for the cab driver to find the entrance, through the back of a large housing compound. Once they've worked out the kinks, it should be a great deal -- but they're not quite there yet. Oct 12 2008	Clean comfortable cheap and convenient hotel!	Great clean hotel with the subway just around the corner. Quite convenient coming from the airport- it's the first stop on the airport express train- get off at exit D at the Sanyuanqiao stop. Little market as you exit the hotel- make your first left. There's also the best restaurant we tried in Beijing named Another Northern Village within a 5 minute walk from the hotel. Sorry, the address is in Chinese but the number is [--]. No english menu but the menu has pictures for every dish and for once the dishes actually looks like the picture. Totally yummy, clean, busy, and cheap that we went back again.Back to the hotel- Free internet, friendly and helpful staff. I would definitely stay here again!PS- the room looks exactly like the picture on the website. Aug 26 2008 	Fantastic value for money with a convenient location !	We stayed at this hotel for one night during the Olympics and we were really pleased.After a reservation went wrong at another hotel, we scrambled around and found that the Ibis at Sanyuanqiao had JUST opened (they were still putting the finishing touches as people were checking in), along with a Novotel, right next door.Ibis is generally known for being a no-frills hotel chain across Europe, and they are now making in-roads into China, where there are already lots of local chains covering this segment of the market. But Ibis comes in with a MUCH higher quality offering at a rock-bottom price, which makes it a perfect choice when visiting China.As I've just mentioned, the hotel is _brand new_, not even a month old at this point, so everything works, and everything is clean (except maybe the surrounding areas, as they're still constructing other buildings around). The room is cozy, a good size for the price, it's clean, and functional. Broadband internet is included in all rooms with no extra charge, so that's always a nice extra. There is a 24-hour snack bar and a cafeteria that can do the job of filling you up, as there aren't many dining or shopping options around.The location at Sanyuanqiao is definitely not central, and it's a bit hard-to-find, tucked away into a new development area, but here's the trump card: the Metro station is literally at the door step- a 2 minutes walk, maximum. And from Line 10, you can access all the major sites (in our case, the olympics sites) within 15-20 minutes, on the cheap, at only 2 yuan per ride.All rooms were aptly priced 888rmb (about 110usd) for the olympics, which was not cheap (but within market range for the olmypics period), but the regular price afterwards is around 264rmb for single, and 364rmb for double, which comes to about 35-50usd, definitely an excellent deal. At this price, if you're visiting Beijing and just want a cozy, no frills, clean place to sleep at night, no matter your budget, Ibis Sanyuanqiao should be at the top of your list. It will be for us when we go back, for sure. Sep 14 2009 	Muy buena calida-precio Aug 28 2009 	????D????3?"
"Sep 13 2009 	What a disaster	What an absolute and complete disaster. This hotel will never be a 5 start hotel of international standards with service as it is. I came here because one of my Shanghai contacts recommended it. Know as a hotel where all of Shanghai business people stay, perhaps it is better recommended for Chinese travelers. English speakers beware as everyone’s English is minimal. I paid top price to be on the executive floor. Rooms are very small compared to comparable hotels and prices in Beijing. The laundry is “included” in the price and done on premises. Sounds good in theory. Unfortunately for me, the hotel doesn’t stand behind their work. I have a ruined Armani Sport shirt and bespoke navy blue blazer. Let me share my experience. I had gone out the day before, walked around Beijing in the summer heat all day, went to lunch and dinner and smoked a cigar. I was wearing the shirt and coat all day. The next morning I handed the blazer and shirt for pressing to the “butler” which they provide on the Exec level. When I returned at the end of the day, I found on my bed, in two bags, my blazer in a ball in one bag and my shirt in another. The shirt was spotted. My blazer had two brushed pewter buttons ripped off of each sleeve. It had also shrunk. I called the front desk manager, Mr. Phillip Hao. Rather than coming himself at first, we sent up the housekeeping manager, Mr. Deway Huang. Mr. Huang, insisted the clothes had not been cleaned but returned to me because of the missing buttons and spots on the shirt. When I opened the shirt bag and smelled the shirt, no cigar or sweat smell, only cleaning agent smell. I asked for Mr. Hao at that time and he came to the room and acknowledged the smell of cleaning fluid. This was done in front of my Chinese guest, so there are witnesses. The cleaning fluid smell certainly contradicted Mr. Huang’s statement that the shirt had not been cleaned. Further, the coat had no cigar smell either. Mr. Huang tried to get me sign the slip that came with the shirt and jacket. It was written in Chinese, and my Chinese colleague pointed out to me that what they were trying to do is sign the acknowledgement that my shirt and jacket were damaged before I gave it to them. Real underhanded. The only thing that I can imagine is that the hotel laundered the coat and dry cleaned the shirt (a “no dry cleaning” shirt). After two wasted hours (8:00-10:00 pm) Mr. Hao said he would have the hotel manager get back with me the next day. Well the hotel manager has never appeared. He sent a second assistant manager in place, Mr. Jason Lee, who did nothing and had no authority. He was supposed to be at my room at 9:15, but at 9:45 he had not yet arrived so I called him and he then came up. Mr. Lee said the housekeeping had tried to reach me during the prior day about the buttons and jacket but I wasn’t there (of course I as out). When I asked why they didn’t leave a message, Mr. Lee said that they didn’t speak good English. As an attorney, it didn’t make much logical sense that they would come to speak to me about it but didn’t want to leave a message. Well, I am out an Armani sport shirt, about $68 and a bespoke navy blazer, about $800. The laundry really isn’t so free! So beware. I also had the impression that they would not have treated a Chinese person this way. Perhaps because I as am American and not one of their favored or Shanghai guests they felt I didn’t merit the manager or a decent resolution to this matter. This hotel has light years to go before becoming a five star hotel and will not be getting there anytime soon. Aug 16 2009 	too much little aggravations for business traveler.	I booked a single room (1 night) with this hotel for reason of our company rate just the same as usual Renaissance and Raddisson.On top the negotiated rate was including free airport transfer to the hotel. So thought let's try. Well... on my way from Europe to Beijing (in Helsinki) I phoned the hotel for information how to get the Free airport transfer. Then the assistant manager (Kelvin) say's to me the rate (which was already confirmed, but 25% higher as our company rate) was not including a free airport transfer. I told not wanting to discuss by phone but rather take a taxito the hotel and sort things out the next morning at check-in.When checking in the personnel found very deep in their books that I had a company rate and I was granted itin return of giving them my business-card for hotel-reference.only the free airport transfer they could not find (could be mistake of our site; have to check). Then when asking for miles for my frequent flyer program, I was told this could not be granted at our company rate... tell me, this is the first ever occurrence I was refused a mileage-reward program. The room was OK but old fashioned furnished; need re-decoration. al basic and standard stuff was availableHowever wonder if they put me in their worst room, for paying our company rateThe breakfast was very wide assortment, but also here too much details which spoiled the fun of having a better then average enjoy. There was f.i. a cheese pattern with 6 different European cheeses.... only one knife for all to cut. The final drawback for me came when starting to eat with the fork, knife and spoon. These tool, I can assure, will never bee stolen from the hotel by any guest as a souvenir, since they simply are not made for the job: Too heavy, no grip, ....; these are probably still the reason they are arround (NEED REPLACEMENT)The two really positive point of this hotel is the spirit of its serving personal, who try to make the best of it for the guests in a building-environment from the mid 80's and the wide assortment for the breakfast. These are the reason I rate this hotel as &quot;average&quot; and not &quot;poor&quot;.This however can not pursue me to ever book this hotel again.I will not recommend it to colleges and others. Jun 10 2009 	superb service on executive floors	Excellent hotel with beautiful rooms, excellent service and helpful staff. Good value on executive floors May 19 2009 	Superb rooms	Had stayed for 5 days with Kunlun, during a business meet in Beijing. Royal rooms one can't dream of at rates as cheap as INR 5000- 6000. Room had a small study and nice spacious bedroom. But of all the bathroom was excellent. I havent seen such large bathroom in my life :) with a huge bath tub with a LCD in front of it and city view by the side.... really royal bathroom... I fell in love with it..... Even the restuarant is good... for breakfast they have a huge huge layout and there is a revolving restuarant on top floor. Good news for Indians that this revolving restuarant serves Dal Makhani and Roti/ Jeera rice and even some chicken/ mutton cooked in authentic Indian style.... It was really dream come true to find Indian food in Beijing Apr 28 2009 	Beautiful	I was on my business trip to Beijing, China. I stayed in the suite in this hotel. Beautiful room and very comfortable stay.See the suit rooms in the photograph below. Jul 16 2007	Nice hotel but terrible location	Overall, the Kunlun Hotel is a nice hotel in terms of quality and price point. But the hotel's location is not the greatest. It is far from everything that is remotely interesting or fun such as the markets and touristy sights such as the Forbidden City, Tiannamen and Wangfujing.But if you are a tourist, stay somewhere in the city centre (Wangfujing or around the major sights), as traffic is horrible and public transportation is not an option for tourists unable to communicate in Mandarin. May 11 2007	no character nor charme	Unfortunately this hotel was not up to my expectations.First of all you can't leave the place at night to go for a quiet walk without being pestered by all sorts of touts, prostitutes and beggars and once you have passed this crowd , there is not much to see in this far out area, next to a very important highway.the service in the hotel is neither attentive nor particularly friendly, you often have the impression the staff would rather be somewhere else..some exceptions to the rule like jessica from reception and the the ladies from housekeeping.maybe its the management thats doing something wrong, but i really think this hotel is neither up to its reputation nor its room rates. Apr 4 2007	A great choice	I have stayed twice at the Kunlun, and will not be dissapointed if you choose this place. The rooms are nice and comfortable, the service is superb and the staff very friendly and professional. It is a big place, but it never seems to be crowded. Nightlife in Beijing does not seem too exciting to me and there are not many places to go around in the neighbourhood (despite the good and central location), so if you are a business traveller like me, you might just want to stay in the hotel, relax and enjoy it. The choice of excellent restaurants and good bars they have there is very impressive, so you can select a different one every day. Mar 12 2007 	Fabulous hotel experience	My first trip to Beijing. Even though the hotel had some renovations ongoing, they did not materially affect the quality of my stay.First impression - stunning. The lobby is absolutely beautiful! See my photos posted separately (sorry for the quality, taken with my cellphone). And the rest of the hotel is a visual feast as well. The only negative I would offer is that the gift shop is minimal.This is for the most part a world-class hotel, in service, accomodations, and amenities. The staff is attentive, we found the food to be excellent and varied (although if you aren't adventurous and insist on Western food, you may be disappointed - but that would be missing the point), and the executive room was sumptuous and very comfortable. By the way, we booked through our local host, and were upgraded to executive rooms upon check-in, all for about 1200RMB/ night - you do the math, but a bargain in every sense. Dec 3 2006 	Professional and comfy	spent little over a week here for work and must say its very nice and the staff is very good. because of the lenght of the stay I met some good people that helped me pick the best spots - ones not always on the map -the food was top noch and the buffet was always the spotfresh everything - great blend of western, euro, and asian food.could always find some thingthe bed was awesome - super firm and comfythe place was always clean and the staff very politei found little extras some nights after work or exploringlaundry was fast and professionalover all the place was very clean and very well rungreat service and peoplewould stay agian in a second... no second thoughts Oct 26 2006 	When in Beijing	Stayed here for 6 nights - very attentive service - rooms excellent - beds turned down at night - large spaces - 8 restaurants offering a variety of dining but you must try the revolving restaurant on the 29th Floor - be weary though the staff will greet you but do not expect them to understand much English May 25 2005 	Executive Level - 21 and above very very nice!	Very nice - executive level that is. i believe 21st and above. Completely renovated. beautiful rooms, comes with bulter. free food on the top floor. great bathrooms. employees all speak enough english and are VERY friendly. they are still renovating the lobby. and it is quite smoke filled on the main level. i had a non-smoking floor and it was fine. no problem. Apr 21 2005 	Nice place	I stood at Hotel Kunlun during a business trip for 2 days. The hotel is still in renovation, but most of the hotels interior is already finished. Only the entrance hall is still under construction. The rooms are somehow spacy, clean and everything in it. Even though nothing special. Breakfirst was included but nothing special either, except that they offer a wide range of different things to eat (for Asians). But the quality was only average and below. Bad thing about my room: on the oppersite side of the road a construction was going on, even at night time - very loud. I probably could have changed the room but I didn't ask - so my fault. Another highlight is the cafe on top of the building where you can look over Beijing - marvelous. And: People are very nice though! Oct 15 2009 	??????? Oct 4 2009 	??????????????

"Nov 26 2009 	Best place for travelers	Hotel was very nice, the room was wonderful and really fit the price. We got 9 nights in the hotel and we were very please and happy . we got a lot of fun and enjoyed our trip. We got really nice services with the staffs. And very honest.Thank for the hotel’s service . you are great you did very good job. Nov 21 2009	Good 3 star with WONDERFUL staff	Beautiful lobby, best staff - very helpful and competent. They were always willing to go the extra mile for our demanding group. Great suggestions for things to do especially since we had several free days. Excellent location near the best fake goods shopping at the Silk St. Market. HAGGLE LIKE HECK there and be prepared to get a headache very quickly. Also, loved having the great hot pot restaurant around the corner (don't eat at McDonald's - this was the ONLY place in China who's food made someone in our group ill). Hotel had great breakfasts, especially the custom soup bar and dim sum. Did enjoy the thai chi entertainment. Of the three hotels we stayed at, this had the best location and food but was definitely not a 5 star in terms of room. Room was somewhat conventional and small. But the maid was very diligent and conscientious about keeping room spotless and well stocked. The pool, fitness center while very nice, took forever to get to. Bathroom amenties were the worst, poor quality shampoo etc. Glad I'd bought my own. Overall would say to stay but don't have high expectations of the room itself. Oct 16 2009 	Nice hotel.	Nice hotel. The position was excellent and the staff was very helpful. Would stay again. Jun 21 2009 	Good hotel - worth a stay!	I stayed one night at the New Otani in September 2004. This Japanese style hotel was recommended to me by a friend from Beijing, so I had high hopes. I wasn't dissapointed. Good rooms. Good location (good Peking duck restaurant nearby). Nice swimming pool and Japanese bath facilities. Nice breakfast with plenty of choice. Would probably return, as there's so many hotels in Beijing to choose from - at least I know that one was good. Aug 8 2008	Central Location Comfortable Hotel	As part of a tour group package, we stayed 4 nights at the New Otani Chang Fu Gong Hotel in Beijing. The hotel is centrally located on Chang An Avenue, the major east-west artery that runs past Tien An Men and the Forbidden City. It is a good choice if you cannot afford to stay at the luxury hotels near Wangfujing Avenue. The public areas are top notch and very well maintained. There is a casual buffet restaurant and a pricier Japanese restaurant onsite. The rooms can comfortably sleep 2 (but probably not more) and the furniture and condition of the room was fine. The beds were quite firm and comfortable and the duvets made for a good night's sleep. Our view was over the busy Chang An Avenue. One of the best features of the hotel package we received was the daily complimentary breakfast buffet that included both Asian and Western breakfast items. There was a huge selection. The hotel complex contains a health club that includes a huge squash court, indoor swimming pool and fitness aerobic room. The spas included separate mens and womens soaking tubs and saunas. The Line 1 and Line 2 subway station Jianguo Men is an easy few minutes walk from the hotel. It requires walking on the pedestrian underpass access of a very busy intersection, but not much of a problem as long as you cross with the locals. The hotel is a ten minute walk to the touristy Silk Market and Friendship Store, as well as a Sizzler, TGIF, 7-11 and Haagen Daas when eating chinese food everyday becomes burdensome. Overall the central location was a hit with us and I would consider returning. Mar 6 2008 	Very Nice Hotel	The New Otani is a great hotel. It was very lovely and did live up to boasts on the various websites. It is a very modern hotel with very Euro/Modern furniture. The hotel room was roomy, very clean, the staff in the restaurant, business center, front desk and all throughout the hotel were very helpful. You can tell that the Chinese in this hotel have studied hospitality and demand that all of it's employees practice it. It was a in a great location in central Beijing, near restaurants and shopping. The ammenities that you would expect to find in a 5* hotel are all there, including sattelite TV, internet access, etc. There were a total of 6 of us who stayed in 3 rooms and we all were quite satisfied with the hotel. Nov 2 2007 	classy hotel	Luxury hotel with elegant, clean and well-equipped rooms. Unforgettable tasty and wide-ranging breakfast and dinner, served in a elegant restaurant overlooking a peaceful inner japanese garden. Further thematic restaurants (i.e. japanese) on the first floor. Swimming pool, indoor tennis/basket/volleyall courts and luxury day-spa with beauty salon inside the hotel. We totally loved our stay here!!!! The unique imperfection regards the restaurant waiters, absolutely not appropriate to the standard of the hotel. Jun 8 2007	Great location	Stayed at the New Otani Beijing for three nights. Best of all about this property is the location. Great indoor pool and fitness room. Had the best Peking duck dinner next door at a restaurant called Duck King. Also next to the hotel, right next to McDonalds is great massage place that was very classy, clean, with great service. We like the massage place so much that we visited for two consecutive nights. The downside about this hotel is the worned out carpet and the bathtub/shower in the rooms we stayed in. Otherwise the hotel is reasonable and the breakfast is adequate. Apr 12 2007 	We would stay at the Otani again	My family stayed at the New Otani in late March while we were in Beijing as part of a three-city China vacation. The Otani was our favorite hotel during the trip. The lobby was spacious and the staff were eager to help you with bags, questions, etc. The rooms were fine, but ours was a smoking room which we did not like. We called the lobby and they sent someone up promptly with some air freshener spray. Breakfast was good as well. The dining room was big so you didn't feel crowded with other guests. And the wait staff were quick with more coffee and to take your dish when you were done. The only bad thing was that the hotel was located on a busy road so you couldn't really cross the street unless you went to the overpass. We sort of felt like we were away from the city center a bit. We would stay there again though the next time we're in Beijing. Mar 3 2007 	Great Value for Money	Stayed here on business for 1 week at the end of January. Found the check in and lobby to be quite pleasant. The lounge is a bit small but Beijing has so much to offer theres not much point staying in. Room size was very good and bed very comfortable. Bathroom was spotless. Hotel staff very friendly and generally efficient. I found the western breakfast to be a bit average but the asian breakfast looked good however theres only so much Chinese food the body can take.The best thing about the hotel is the location, just 2 minutes by taxi to the silk market (where you can buy the best fake goods), Anything you can think of, just ask and they will have it. Remember to pay only about 20 percent of the asking price at most. Tianeman square/forbidden city is 15 minutes by taxi Which should only cost the equivalent of 2 US Dollars.Hotel rate very reasonable and overall I found the hotel to be excellent value for money. Jan 26 2007	Nice	Very nice lobby, decent size rooms and beds, helpful employees. A nice perk is the tap water is drinkable and the location is central. Close walk to malls and restaurants.Also, the complimentary breakfast was exceptional.Stayed here two nights and would definitely stay here again. Dec 31 2006 	Safe Choice	Convenient location for both business and tourist. All the cab drivers know where it is. Hotel food is adequate or above average with the Japanese being the better choice. Since it is a hotel under Japanese management, showers and bathroom facilities can be on the short side and not designed for westerners. No joke! :) I did find it kind of odd since two of my business colleagues started to joke about it. Room is of decent size and clean enough. It needs a little updating. The lobby bar is of decent size and is a good place to unwind after a day of sightseeing/meetings. Nov 2 2006	Lovely thought not quite a Westerner's dream	This was my second stay in thishotel while on a tour of China.The facility is really lovely and the rooms are quite nice. As with many hotels in China, the level of English fluency is fairly thin: fine when they are first talking to you (as at chekc-in) and can speak in the standard phrases, but lost once you start asking questions. Your best bet is to keep your eyes and ears open for the ONE really good English speaker on duty at the moment -- and there usually is ONE -- and try to get him or her to handle your request.This chain is Japanese-owned, and that is apparent to a Western sensibility in small ways. You may find that a plus or a minus.The breakfast buffet is quite good. The business center staff was very helpful and competent. Porters and door attendants polite and attentive.The staff was very helpful when I wanted to buy a bottle of wine as a gift for someone in my group: they let me purchase it from the Western restaurant in the hotel, even though it was not yet opened for the day.I'm not that crazy about the location, as i like to walk around the neighborhood a bit when I'm in a city, and it doesn't feel that central. On two sides, it is hemmed in by huge elevated highways, so your walking choices are limited. though our guide claimed there was no such central area that was more commercial for walking.Overall, I was pleased with my stay there. Mar 10 2006	New Otani was a great Beijing stay	We stayed here as part of a tour group. It was the 1st city on our 2 week China trip. It's mostly a Japanese business hotel and a few tourists. The breakfast buffet was very good and they had live cooking stations as well. Lots of choices.The rooms were very clean and nice sized and quiet. The staf was very friendly, though they speak more Japanese than English. It's centrally located and about a 20 min walk to Tianimen Square. I would highly recommend staying here. Apr 29 2005	Great Location	Stayed in New Otani in April 2005. Great location. Hotel room was decent size. Part of a tour package. Room was very clean and quiet. Buffet breakfast was part of package. Breakfast was fine. Staff spoke decent English. One block away from a shopping center and the Beijing Frendship store. 10 minutes away from the Forbidden City. Expedia lists it as 2 star its closer to a 4 star. Tour stated it was 5 star. Nothing really special to make it stand out except for location. Nov 8 2004	Quality Stay	We stayed here last year and had a very comfortable stay. The rooms are very quiet and comfortable. However, the rooms are nothing fancy and are in need of updating. The breakfasts were very good and more than ample. There is a choice of two buffets, Western and Eastern. The service and staff were great and attentive and spoke English to a small extent.

"Report: Japanese government chides Mitsubishi over recall delays Filed under: Government/Legal , Japan , Recalls , Mitsubishi An official with the transport ministry in Japan has some stern words for Mitsubishi , taking the carmaker to task for not being more proactive and honest about its recalls. An investigation into The Tri-Star last December found Mitsubishi was tardy investigating problems and didn't explain itself forthrightly to the transport ministry about the issues. None of Mitsubishi's actions were illegal, and we should stress that this is a dialogue with Mitsubishi in Japan, not Mitsubishi Motors North America. The official advised the automaker to, ""Come up with plans for improvement, implement them and report them to the ministry."" It looks like the company will get more practice than it wants in that department, having to announce another recall for the Outlander PHEV over software and hardware glitches. Those recalls come just after Mitsu finally figured out the problem with overheating lithium-ion batteries that caused a production halt of the plug-in hybrid SUV.

Yesterday at 11:38 AM Report abuse Permalink its rather odd that the Japanese government chooses to go public with this issue now, as Mitsubishi's issue with ignoring problems and refusing to issue recalls goes all the way back to the 70s. less than 20 years ago, they had major issues with their Fuso medium duty trucks and buses having brake failures, killing hundreds of people. the Japanese government ignored the problem for over ten years, until public outcry forced it out into the open. none of these issues could have ever been hidden without coverups and payoffs by Mitsubishi that went to the highest levels in the Japanese Government. facts like this shock many Americans, but graft and corruption are ""business as usual"" in Japan, and many other countries. Japan is not a consumer-protected country, and Japan has no consumer protection agency of any kind. corporations are king, and are ALWAYS right. Yesterday at 11:22 AM Report abuse Permalink 2 replies to reattadudes's comment less than 20 years ago, they had major issues with their Fuso medium duty trucks and buses having brake failures, killing hundreds of people No! It was thousands! Millions! Yesterday at 12:03 PM Report abuse Permalink Never heard that it killed hundreds. What report are you looking at? Yesterday at 12:55 PM Report abuse Permalink Good to see the Japanese government coming out on the side of the consumer, well done. Mitusbishi just seem so corrupt and rotten it runs rife right though the company, the products design are totally yuk (Pig ugly L200 Triton just so very unpractical, no rear double cab headroom is totally the most useless gormless pick-up truck ever designed). I know folk that have had crankshaft pulley's sheared right off, Mitsubishi just don't want to know, fix the problem whilst still under guarantee, its like trying to ""squeeze blood out of a stone"" process trying to get them to fix anything that is a design flaw and their fault. To now hear they are not being proactive at coming foreword with vital recall information, it just does not surprise me one bit. Used to love their old products like the big boxy spacious practical 7 seater tough bomp proof Pajaro, that used to do so well winning Dakar rally year after year with some really great robust products in the past. Its a shame to see the absolutely abysmal products they put out today, they have very little to offer no wonder they are sinking fast. Yesterday at 10:13 AM Report abuse Permalink The Tri-Star? Why do writers try so hard to come up with cute pet names for Mitsubishi? The name means three diamonds, not stars. It isn\'t the Diamond-Star company either. The vehicle has problems because of the batteries. The batteries come from the same company that makes the batteries that is keeping the Boeing Dreamliners grounded. Yesterday at 10:09 AM Report abuse Permalink Of the smaller Japanese automakers, I respect Mitsubishi and Subaru, because they have kept their factories open in America and still employ people here. I do not respect Mazda, because they shut down their U.S. operations, laid off the workers and are now building a factory in Mexico. Mazda lost me when they did that - it's like spit in the face to the U.S. worker. Some people go out of their way to buy cars that are not built by Americans, so Mazda must be tailoring to that crowd now. Mitsubishi cars are actually very highly rated by Consumer Reports for their reliability and the Outlander Sport (built in the U.S.) recently won the Automotive Science Group Award for best overall small SUV on the market today. The Outlander Sport SE AWD is also the only SUV listed in the 2013 Consumer Reports car buying guide for the best picks in the ""under $25,000"" category. I think Mitsubishi has a marketing problem here in the United States that they need to overcome. Overall, MItsubishi is posting good profits worldwide these days, but they need to build more to tastes in the U.S. to survive here. For starters, they need to change the front grill of the new 2014 Outlander back to the Lancer jet fighter grill, instead of the new look. Maybe I'm out in left field with that opinion, but the new front grill just looks odd and will take away from all of the good changes that they made throughout the rest of the vehicle. Yesterday at 10:08 AM Report abuse Permalink Mitsubishi, as a car company, has been in a slow decline after the breakup with Chrysler. Although the two companies came up with a few very good products, neither had the depth of resources to make the alliance really work. Chrysler has found Fiat, and the merger seems to be working well for both as Fiat has a lot to offer and Chrysler has always been just short of being more than competitive across the market range with one or two ""best in class"" vehicles among a few also ran offerings. Right now the ""Three Diamond"" company has nothing to offer in a merger and I believe they will sell off their commercial vehicle operations and slowly go off into the sun set. I also believe that the Japanese automotive ranks will be thinned out some more as American and other Asian companies eat into their market.

"films adapted from comic books have had plenty of success , whether they're about superheroes ( batman , superman , spawn ) , or geared toward kids ( casper ) or the arthouse crowd ( ghost world ) , but there's never really been a comic book like from hell before . for starters , it was created by alan moore ( and eddie campbell ) , who brought the medium to a whole new level in the mid '80s with a 12-part series called the watchmen . to say moore and campbell thoroughly researched the subject of jack the ripper would be like saying michael jackson is starting to look a little odd . the book ( or "" graphic novel , "" if you will ) is over 500 pages long and includes nearly 30 more that consist of nothing but footnotes . in other words , don't dismiss this film because of its source . if you can get past the whole comic book thing , you might find another stumbling block in from hell's directors , albert and allen hughes . getting the hughes brothers to direct this seems almost as ludicrous as casting carrot top in , well , anything , but riddle me this : who better to direct a film that's set in the ghetto and features really violent street crime than the mad geniuses behind menace ii society ? the ghetto in question is , of course , whitechapel in 1888 london's east end . it's a filthy , sooty place where the whores ( called "" unfortunates "" ) are starting to get a little nervous about this mysterious psychopath who has been carving through their profession with surgical precision . when the first stiff turns up , copper peter godley ( robbie coltrane , the world is not enough ) calls in inspector frederick abberline ( johnny depp , blow ) to crack the case . abberline , a widower , has prophetic dreams he unsuccessfully tries to quell with copious amounts of absinthe and opium . upon arriving in whitechapel , he befriends an unfortunate named mary kelly ( heather graham , say it isn't so ) and proceeds to investigate the horribly gruesome crimes that even the police surgeon can't stomach . i don't think anyone needs to be briefed on jack the ripper , so i won't go into the particulars here , other than to say moore and campbell have a unique and interesting theory about both the identity of the killer and the reasons he chooses to slay . in the comic , they don't bother cloaking the identity of the ripper , but screenwriters terry hayes ( vertical limit ) and rafael yglesias ( les mis ? rables ) do a good job of keeping him hidden from viewers until the very end . it's funny to watch the locals blindly point the finger of blame at jews and indians because , after all , an englishman could never be capable of committing such ghastly acts . and from hell's ending had me whistling the stonecutters song from the simpsons for days ( "" who holds back the electric car/who made steve guttenberg a star ? "" ) . don't worry - it'll all make sense when you see it . now onto from hell's appearance : it's certainly dark and bleak enough , and it's surprising to see how much more it looks like a tim burton film than planet of the apes did ( at times , it seems like sleepy hollow 2 ) . the print i saw wasn't completely finished ( both color and music had not been finalized , so no comments about marilyn manson ) , but cinematographer peter deming ( don't say a word ) ably captures the dreariness of victorian-era london and helped make the flashy killing scenes remind me of the crazy flashbacks in twin peaks , even though the violence in the film pales in comparison to that in the black-and-white comic . oscar winner martin childs' ( shakespeare in love ) production design turns the original prague surroundings into one creepy place . even the acting in from hell is solid , with the dreamy depp turning in a typically strong performance and deftly handling a british accent . ians holm ( joe gould's secret ) and richardson ( 102 dalmatians ) log in great supporting roles , but the big surprise here is graham . i cringed the first time she opened her mouth , imagining her attempt at an irish accent , but it actually wasn't half bad . the film , however , is all good . 2 : 00 - r for strong violence/gore , sexuality , language and drug content"
"every now and then a movie comes along from a suspect studio , with every indication that it will be a stinker , and to everybody's surprise ( perhaps even the studio ) the film becomes a critical darling . mtv films' _election , a high school comedy starring matthew broderick and reese witherspoon , is a current example . did anybody know this film existed a week before it opened ? the plot is deceptively simple . george washington carver high school is having student elections . tracy flick ( reese witherspoon ) is an over-achiever with her hand raised at nearly every question , way , way , high . mr . "" m "" ( matthew broderick ) , sick of the megalomaniac student , encourages paul , a popular-but-slow jock to run . and paul's nihilistic sister jumps in the race as well , for personal reasons . the dark side of such sleeper success is that , because expectations were so low going in , the fact that this was quality stuff made the reviews even more enthusiastic than they have any right to be . you can't help going in with the baggage of glowing reviews , which is in contrast to the negative baggage that the reviewers were likely to have . _election , a good film , does not live up to its hype . what makes _election_ so disappointing is that it contains significant plot details lifted directly from _rushmore_ , released a few months earlier . the similarities are staggering : tracy flick ( _election_ ) is the president of an extraordinary number of clubs , and is involved with the school play . max fischer ( _rushmore_ ) is the president of an extraordinary number of clubs , and is involved with the school play . the most significant tension of _election_ is the potential relationship between a teacher and his student . the most significant tension of _rushmore_ is the potential relationship between a teacher and his student . tracy flick is from a single parent home , which has contributed to her drive . max fischer is from a single parent home , which has contributed to his drive . the male bumbling adult in _election_ ( matthew broderick ) pursues an extramarital affair , gets caught , and his whole life is ruined . he even gets a bee sting . the male bumbling adult in _rushmore_ ( bill murray ) pursues an extramarital affair , gets caught , and his whole life is ruined . he gets several bee stings . and so on . what happened ? how is it that an individual screenplay ( _rushmore_ ) and a novel ( _election_ ) contain so many significant plot points , and yet both films were probably not even aware of each other , made from two different studios , from a genre ( the high school geeks revenge movie ) that hadn't been fully formed yet ? even so , the strengths of _election_ rely upon its fantastic performances from broderick , witherspoon , and newcomer jessica campbell , as paul's anti-social sister , tammy . broderick here is playing the mr . rooney role from _ferris bueller_ , and he seems to be having the most fun he's had since then . witherspoon is a revelation . it's early in the year , it's a comedy , and teenagers have little clout , but for my money , witherspoon deserves an oscar nomination . and once campbell's character gets going , like in her fantastic speech in the gymnasium , then you're won over . one thing that's been bothering me since i've seen it . there is an extraordinary amount of sexuality in this film . i suppose that , coming from mtv films , i should expect no less . . . but the film starts off light and airy , like a sitcom . as the screws tighten , and the tensions mount , alexander payne decides to add elements that , frankly , distract from the story . it is bad enough that mr . m doesn't like tracy's determination to win at all costs , but did they have to throw in the student/teacher relationship ? even so , there's no logical reason why mr . m has an affair when he does . there's a lot to like in _election_ , but the plot similarities to _rushmore_ , and the tonal nosedive it takes as it gets explicitly sex-driven , mark this as a disappointment ."
"you've got mail works alot better than it deserves to . in order to make the film a success , all they had to do was cast two extremely popular and attractive stars , have them share the screen for about two hours and then collect the profits . no real acting was involved and there is not an original or inventive bone in it's body ( it's basically a complete re-shoot of the shop around the corner , only adding a few modern twists ) . essentially , it goes against and defies all concepts of good contemporary filmmaking . it's overly sentimental and at times terribly mushy , not to mention very manipulative . but oh , how enjoyable that manipulation is . but there must be something other than the casting and manipulation that makes the movie work as well as it does , because i absolutely hated the previous ryan/hanks teaming , sleepless in seattle . it couldn't have been the directing , because both films were helmed by the same woman . i haven't quite yet figured out what i liked so much about you've got mail , but then again , is that really important ? if you like something so much , why even question it ? again , the storyline is as cliched as they come . tom hanks plays joe fox , the insanely likeable owner of a discount book chain and meg ryan plays kathleen kelley , the even more insanely likeable proprietor of a family-run children's book shop called , in a nice homage , the shop around the corner . fox and kelley soon become bitter rivals because the new fox books store is opening up right across the block from the small business . little do they know , they are already in love with each other over the internet , only neither party knows the other person's true identity . the rest of the story isn't important because all it does is serve as a mere backdrop for the two stars to share the screen . sure , there are some mildly interesting subplots , but they all fail in comparison to the utter cuteness of the main relationship . all of this , of course , leads up to the predictable climax . but as foreseeable as the ending is , it's so damn cute and well-done that i doubt any movie in the entire year contains a scene the evokes as much pure joy as this part does . when ryan discovers the true identity of her online love , i was filled with such , for lack of a better word , happiness that for the first time all year , i actually left the theater smiling ."
""" jaws "" is a rare film that grabs your attention before it shows you a single image on screen . the movie opens with blackness , and only distant , alien-like underwater sounds . then it comes , the first ominous bars of composer john williams' now infamous score . dah-dum . from there , director steven spielberg wastes no time , taking us into the water on a midnight swim with a beautiful girl that turns deadly . right away he lets us know how vulnerable we all are floating in the ocean , and once "" jaws "" has attacked , it never relinquishes its grip . perhaps what is most outstanding about "" jaws "" is how spielberg builds the movie . he works it like a theatrical production , with a first act and a second act . unlike so many modern filmmakers , he has a great deal of restraint , and refuses to show us the shark until the middle of the second act . until then , he merely suggests its presence with creepy , subjective underwater shots and williams' music . he's building the tension bit by bit , so when it comes time for the climax , the shark's arrival is truly terrifying . he doesn't let us get bored with the imagery . the first act opens with police chief martin brody ( roy scheider ) , a new york cop who has taken an easy , peaceful job running the police station on amity island , a fictitious new england resort town where there hasn't been a murder or a gun fired in 25 years . the island is shaken up by several vicious great white shark attacks right before the fourth of july , and the mayor , larry vaughn ( murray hamilton ) , doesn't want to shut down the beaches because the island is reliant on summer tourist money . brody is joined by matt hooper ( richard dreyfuss ) , a young , ambitious shark expert from the marine institute . hooper is as fascinated by the shark as he is determined to help brody stop it -- his knowledge about the exact workings of the shark ( "" it's a perfect engine , an eating machine "" ) make it that much more terrifying . when vaughn finally relents , hooper and brody join a crusty old shark killer named quint ( robert shaw ) on his decrepit boat , the orca , to search for the shark . the entire second act takes place on the orca as the three men hunt the shark , and inevitably , are hunted by it . "" jaws "" is a thriller with a keen sense of humor and an incredible sense of pacing , tension , and horror . it is like ten movies all rolled into one , and it's no wonder it took america by storm in the summer of 1975 , taking in enough money to crown it the box office champ of all time ( until it was unceremoniously dethroned in 1977 by "" star wars "" ) . even today , fascination with this film is on par with hitchcock's "" psycho , "" and it never seems to age . although grand new technology exists that makes the technical sequences , including several mechanical sharks , obsolete , none of it could improve the film because it only would lead to overkill . the technical limitations faced by spielberg in 1975 may have actually produced a better film because it forced him to rely on traditional cinematic elements like pacing , characterization , sharp editing , and creative photography , instead of simply dousing the audience with digital shark effects . scheider , dreyfuss , and shaw were known actors at the time "" jaws "" was made , but none of them had the draw of a robert redford or paul newman . nevertheless , this film guaranteed them all successful careers because each gave an outstanding performance and refused to be overshadowed by the shark . scheider hits just the right notes as a sympathetic husband and father caught in the political quagmire of doing what's right and going against the entire town . "" it's your first summer here , you know , "" mayor vaughn warns him . dreyfuss , who had previously been seen in "" american graffiti "" ( 1973 ) and "" the apprenticeship of duddy kravitz "" ( 1974 ) gives a surprisingly mature , complex performance for someone who had literally only played kids and teenagers . however , most outstanding is the gnarled performance by robert shaw as the movie's captain ahab , a performance sorely overlooked by the academy awards . bordering of parody , shaw plays quint as a grizzled old loner whose machismo borders on masochism . he's slightly deranged , and shaw's performance is almost a caricature . however , there is one scene late in the film , when he and brody and hooper are below deck on the orca comparing scars . quint is drawn into telling the story of his experiences aboard the u . s . s . indianapolis , a navy ship in world war ii that was sunk by the japanese . his tale of floating in the water for more than a week with over 1 , 000 other men while swarms of sharks slowly devoured them them is actually more hair-raising than anything spielberg put on screen . shaw delivers the story in one long take , and it is the best acting in the film . of course , we can't leave out the shark itself ; with its black eyes , endless rows of teeth , and insatiable urge to eat , it is basically the epitome of all mankind's fears about what is unknown and threatening in nature . a shark is such a perfect nemesis it is real -- having survived sinch the dinosaurs , great whites do exist , they can be as large as the shark in "" jaws , "" and they are a threat . every one of spielberg's subjective underwater shots makes us feel queasy because lets us see how we look to the shark : a bunch of writihing , dangling , completely unprotected legs just ready to be chomped into . the shark in "" jaws "" was actually a combination of actual footage and five different mechanical sharks ( all nicknamed "" bruce "" by the crew ) built to be shot from different angles . many have forgotten , but "" jaws "" was a sort of precursor to "" waterworld "" ( 1995 ) , a movie's who soggy production and cost overruns had universal studios worried about a bomb . but , as we can see now , spielberg overcame all the obstacles , and delivered one of the finest primal scare-thrillers ever to come out of hollywood ."
"moviemaking is a lot like being the general manager of an nfl team in the post-salary cap era -- you've got to know how to allocate your resources . every dollar spent on a free-agent defensive tackle is one less dollar than you can spend on linebackers or safeties or centers . in the nfl , this leads to teams like the detroit lions , who boast a superstar running back with a huge contract , but can only field five guys named herb to block for him . in the movies , you end up with films like "" spawn "" , with a huge special-effects budget but not enough money to hire any recognizable actors . jackie chan is the barry sanders of moviemaking . he spins and darts across the screen like sanders cutting back through the defensive line . watching jackie in operation condor as he drives his motorcycle through the crowded streets of madrid , fleeing an armada of pursuers in identical black compact cars , is reminiscent of sanders running for daylight with the chicago bears in hot pursuit , except that sanders doesn't have to worry about rescuing runaway baby carriages . but like the lions star , jackie doesn't have anybody to block for him . almost every cent that's invested in a jackie chan movie goes for stunts , and as chan does his own stunts , the rest of the money goes to pay his hospital bills . this leaves about 75 cents to pay for things like directors ( chan directs ) , scripts and dubbing and supporting characters , not to mention the hideous title sequence . this also explains why the movie was shot in odd places like morocco and spain . ( chan's first release in this country , "" rumble in the bronx "" , was supposedly set in new york , but was filmed in vancouver , and in the chase scenes the canadian rockies are clearly visible . ) heck , jackie doesn't even have enough money for a haircut , looks like , much less a personal hairstylist . in condor , chan plays the same character he's always played , himself , a mixture of bruce lee and tim allen , a master of both kung-fu and slapstick-fu . jackie is sent by the un to retrieve a cache of lost nazi gold in the north african desert , and is chased by a horde of neo-nazi sympathizers and two stereotypical arabs ( one of the things i like about jackie chan movies : no political correctness ) . he is joined by three women , who have little to do except scream , "" jackie , save us ! "" , and misuse firearms . the villain is an old nazi whose legs were broken in the secret base so that he has to be carried everywhere , and he's more pathetic than evil . en route , we have an extended motorcycle chase scene , a hilarious fight in the moroccan version of motel 6 with the neo-nazis , and two confrontations with savage natives . once at the secret desert base , there is a long chop-socky sequence , followed by the film's centerpiece , a wind-tunnel fight that's even better than the one in face/off . this is where the money was spent , on well-choreographed kung-fu sequences , on giant kevlar hamster balls , on smashed-up crates of bananas , and on scorpions . ignore the gaping holes in the plot ( how , exactly , if the villain's legs were broken , did he escape from the secret nazi base , and why didn't he take the key with him ? ) . don't worry about the production values , or what , exactly , the japanese girl was doing hitchhiking across the sahara . just go see the movie . operation condor has pretentions of being a "" raiders of the lost ark "" knockoff , but one wonders what jackie could do with the raiders franchise blocking for him -- with a lawrence kazdan screenplay , a john williams score , spielberg directing and george lucas producing , condor might be an a+ movie . however , you've got to go with what you've got , and what you've got in jackie chan is something special -- a talent that mainstream hollywood should , could , and ought to utilize ."
"on june 30 , 1960 , a self-taught , idealistic , yet pragmatic , young man became , at age 36 , the first head of government of a newly independent african state , formerly the belgian congo . two months later , he was ousted from his powerful position and hunted by government troops until he was captured and brutally murdered along with two aides . this little-known story of this meteoric rise and fall is told my international filmmaker raoul peck in "" lumumba . "" patrice lumumba's ( eriq ebouaney ) story has been told previously by helmer peck in his 1991 award winning documentary , "" lumumba - death of a prophet , "" virtually guaranteeing that his new , fictional account of a patriot remains true to its subject . peck , with co-writer pascal bonitzer , begins at the end of the story of the young political leader . we watch as two white men perform the gruesome task of dismembering the bodies of three black men . images of hatchets , saws and fast-emptying whiskey bottles accompany the grisly image . jump back a few years to a meeting among the black leaders in the belgian-owned congo . a third class postal worker , lumumba , speaks his mind to heads of the most powerful tribes , proclaiming himself not tribal , not regional , but a national leader . his small , mobile party , the congolese national movement ( mnc ) is gaining prominence and patrice leaves his clerical job to sell beer , and get his face known , in the bustling capital , stanleyville . at a time when the colonial empires are falling down around the world , lumumba is in the right place at the right time and , through political savvy and chess-like manipulation , achieves a position of leadership of the mnc . as the date for independence approaches , he tactically positions himself to be the new nation's first prime minister and defense minister , supporting the presidency of joseph kasa vubu ( maka kotto ) . the coalition he created soon starts to fall apart as the former belgian masters continue to exert influence on the struggling nation as they strive to maintain economic hold on the country's vast natural resources of copper , diamonds , gold and more . lumumba won't seek the help of the us , knowing that they would try to create de facto american control of the fledgling government . his initial investigation into soviet assistance immediately tags patrice as a communist and his integrity is overshadowed by the cold war threat of russian domination . the situation goes from bad to worse as the army mutinies , the remaining whites begin to evacuate or arm themselves , belgian troops violently intervene , the lucrative katanga province succeeds under the leadership of rival moise tschombe ( pascal nzonzi ) and lumumba is refused access to his own country when he returns from a conference abroad . this tumultuous and little known period of modern african history saw a score of nations struggling for independence from the sometimes-odious colonialists who have ruled much of the world from their european seats of power for centuries . peck focuses his story on familiar material that strives to give an honest portrayal of patrice lumumba , his friend and foes and the independence movements that gripped africa in the 50's and 60's . ( during the time the story takes place , many new nations , including nigeria and somalia , were born , with varying degrees of success and failure , usually dependent upon which country colonized them . some colonial masters were better than others . ) the effort involved in "" lumumba "" is quite ambitious as peck and his crew before and behind the camera strive to bring to life this slice of world history that might have gone unexplored for decades , if at all . production values are first rate on what must be a small , by us standards , budget . the period feel and realistic african settings are nicely maintained in a production that traveled from zimbabwe to mozambique . the screenplay covers a lot of ground and does yeoman's work in providing a great deal of detailed history while trying to do justice to the story of lumumba's life . the political side of things is evenly told in a linear , straightforward manner that teaches , not preaches . it concentrates on the good deeds of the man , if a bit as a stalwart saint , but doesn't embellish on a larger than life persona . the family side of patrice's life is handled in several , perfunctory and brief interludes that show him talking to one of his children , embracing his wife or lamenting the death of his child . i know the intent is to flesh the man out , but too short a shrift is given to the family man side of lumumba . the story , as such , has a lopsided feel about it . high marks go to eriq ebouaney as the title character . the actor gives a convincing , charismatic performance as the multifaceted , politically deft patrice lumumba who has the good of his people and his country as the force driving his own ambitions . in true docudrama tradition , the supporting cast does not outshine the star , complementing his good efforts , instead . "" lumumba "" is a solid , interesting , educational and honest docudrama that should appeal to film buffs and politicos , both . it has more intelligence in its telling than anything i've seen out of hollywood for months and i give it a b+ ."
"apparently , director tony kaye had a major battle with new line regarding his new film , american history x . i don't know the details of the fight , but it seems that he is not happy with the final product , and nearly removed his name from the credits altogether . i've heard about this kind of thing happening before , and it makes me wonder how much input a studio has over the films they produce . as it is , i found american history x to be an extremely good film , not just because of tony kaye's focused look at the touchy subject of racism , but because of a powerful , charismatic performance from edward norton . it's hard to believe that it has only been two years since norton's fantastic role in primal fear , but , here he is now , starring in his own film and making himself a star . norton is one of those performers who becomes his character , and his work in american history x is one of the very best performances this year . he plays a young man named derek vinyard , a skinhead living in venice beach with his brother , danny ( edward furlong ) , mother ( beverly d'angelo ) , and sister , davin ( jennifer lien ) . the film opens with a flashback , in which derek brutally kills two black men vandalizing his car . we find out that this lands him in prison , and the film from that point is seen through the eyes of danny . in the present-time of the film , danny is in high school , and eager to follow the footsteps of his brother . much of the film is told in flashback , and we see the path that leads to derek's adoption of white supremacy . when derek is released , having served three years in prison , he finds that his brother is now a full-blown skinhead ; derek , however , has given up the violence , and tries to get his brother to understand why racism and the violence that comes with it are bad things . what makes this all interesting is that these two young men are not stupid , thoughtless people -- they are intelligent and articulate , and voice their beliefs in disturbingly straightforward terms . it's hard to make a controversial movie and not preach , but kaye has found the right note for his material . because american history x is a mainstream film , there has to be a redemption phase for our main character -- some people may think that this is the only way to make him sympathetic . i partially disagree with this , because , although i do not advocate racism in any way , it's interesting the way kaye presents derek -- he is a loud , obnoxious man , but he's also very smart . the reasons for why he becomes a skinhead are believable -- his father was arbitrarily killed by a group of black men . it's clear that he's passionate about his beliefs , and that he's not just a punk looking for an excuse to beat people up . of course , it helps that kaye has an actor as talented as norton to play this part . it's astonishing how frightening norton looks with a shaved head and a swastika on his chest . in addition to getting the look just right , he's perfect for this role -- derek requires intelligence , depth , and a whole lot of shouting , and norton does it all with ease . even when he's at his meanest , derek has a likable quality to him , and that's a gutsy approach when telling a story about a skinhead . what adds depth to the story is a subplot in which the principal of danny's school ( avery brooks ) becomes obsessed with purging the hatred from danny . the other performances are all terrific , with standouts from furlong , d'angelo , and lien . visually , the film is very powerful . kaye indulges in a lot of interesting artistic choices , and most of them work nicely -- lots of slow-motion and strange camera angles add to a moody atmosphere . but , like a lot of movies lately , american history x skims past greatness in the last few minutes . although the climactic scene is very moving , the picture ends with a pretentious , preachy resolution featuring a brief narration from a character who was killed . for a movie so smart a subtle up until that point , it felt like a slap in the face to be hand-fed a theme in such a simplistic way . it makes me wonder what , exactly , tony kaye disliked about the final version of his film . perhaps this last scene was the problem . it's hard to imagine any director not being at least partially pleased with a film this good -- in a time when so many movies are timid and weak , american history x manages to make a compelling argument for racism without advocating it any way ."
"one of my colleagues was surprised when i told her i was willing to see betsy's wedding . and she was shocked to hear that i actually liked it . her reaction was understandable when you consider that the film revolves around molly ringwald , who hasn't made a worthwhile film since 1986 . but the fact is , betsy's wedding is also an alan alda film . and while ringwald has been making duds for the last four years , alda has been involved with several noteworthy projects , including crimes and misdemeanors and a new life . written and directed by alda , betsy's wedding is a vibrant slice-of-life , mixing a few dramatic moments into a big bowl of whimsical humor . alda's comic elixir is smooth and refreshing--and a welcome change of pace from the usual summer fare . as bride and groom , molly ringwald and dylan walsh are the pivotal characters in the film , but they are by far the least interesting . walsh is a nonentity , with all the screen presence of a door knob . ringwald is simply unbearable and is easily the weakest link in the chain . she looks hideous with her short-cropped orange hair , red lip-stick and grotesque outfits . she's supposed to be a dress designer , but she looks more like a clown . and to make matters worse , ringwald's performance matches her appearance . thankfully , alda keeps ringwald's screen time to a minimum ; he is far more interested in the colorful periphery characters . the wedding is just a device to bring together the bride's working-class , italian family and the groom's rich , gentile family . ringwald's folks are homey and down-to-earth , with alda as her free-spirited father , madeline kahn as her practical mother , and ally sheedy as her lonely sister . walsh's clan , on the other hand , is prim , proper and ostentatious . when the two families meet and mingle , the movie becomes a story of culture clash , or as one character puts it , "" money versus values . "" ally sheedy , in a wonderfully understated performance , is one of the film's most pleasant surprises . sheedy expresses more with just her eyes than ringwald does with her entire body . it's anthony lapaglia , however , who seizes the spotlight . lapaglia plays stevie dee , a suave , overly polite mafioso who is formally courting sheedy with old-fashioned chivalry . lapaglia's sincere but dim-witted character is a riot . and what's uncanny is that lapaglia is a dead ringer for robert de niro , with a little bit of alec baldwin thrown in for good measure . lapaglia seems to have attended the de niro school of gangster acting , and his inspired performance is partly a tribute to his role-model and partly a rip-off . i don't know whether to say a star is born or a star is re-born , but i do know that lapaglia's over-the-top performance should not be missed . the scrumptious comic acting , however , extends well beyond sheedy and lapaglia . joe pesci , in particular , sinks his teeth into his role as alda's unscrupulous brother-in-law , a slum lord with mob ties , who is cheating on his wife ( catherine o'hara ) . alda , faced with challenge of both directing and acting , somehow finds just the right comic touch as the bride's financially-strapped father , a carpenter whose dreams are bigger than his wallet . the film adopts alda's psychological point of view as he tries to one : plan the wedding , and two : pay for it . as a filmmaker , alda's style of humor is remarkably restrained and tasteful . and while he doesn't have the comic genius of a woody allen , alda does possess the inspiration to make movies which are ten times more entertaining than the slop which usually passes for comedy ."
"after bloody clashes and independence won , lumumba refused to pander to the belgians , who continued a condescending and paternalistic relationship with the congo . their officers , particularly general janssens ( rudi delhem ) in the force publique , the congo's army , caused rebellions , undermining lumumba , who was outraged at the rape and murder of belgian nationals . with unrest building , moise tshombe ( pascal nzonzi ) and the province of katanga , which contained 70 percent of the country's resources , proclaimed secession . lumumba replaced janssens , making mobutu a colonel , and went on a pacification tour with congolese president joseph kasa vubu ( maka kotto ) , but it was too late . 'when you want to drown a dog , you say it has rabies , ' prophesies lumumba of his own fate . peck and bonitzer do an exemplary job telling a complicated tale with a myriad of players , although they frequently succumb to cliche , particularly regarding lumumba's private life . peck's script illuminates bantu sayings like 'the hand that gives , rules' when lumumba uses it with the american ambassador . peck's direction is less assured , with many scenes unfortunately playing like standard television fare . he's served well , though , by his casting of ebouaney in the title role . ebouaney is dynamic , radiating his character's fierce passion for his people and his country . lumumba's intelligence and ability to strategize , even as he's cornered by insurmountable odds , are given life by ebouaney . peck's subject and lead actor elevate his film above its mediocre production . "" lumumba "" is a story that deserves to be told and ebouaney's performance makes the tragedy personally felt ."
"the american action film has been slowly drowning to death in a sea of asian wire-fu copycats . it's not a pretty death , and it's leaving the likes of schwartznager , stallone , and van damme wearing cement galoshes at the bottom of a kung fu sea . sometimes , the mix results in a mind-blowing spectacle unlike any other . quality action with amazing and exciting stunt work , as in 1999's the matrix , can be a real gem . but too often hollywood gets it wrong , even when they pay off chinese directors . flying ninjas and floating karate masters have been replaced by soaring bronx detectives and slow motion kicking scientists . mostly it's laughable . in hollywood's rush to emulate the success of the matrix , trademark asian stunt choreography has become more of a joke than an art form . but iron monkey , the latest asian import , shows us how to get it right . iron monkey ( actually a reissue of a 1993 film ) is the story of a 19th chinese vigilante ( rongguang yu ) , fighting with his own unique style of shaolin kung fu for the rights of the oppressed and the bellies of the hungry . but it is also a piece of the narrative of legendary chinese film hero wong fei-hong , most recently seen in one of the most overlooked , and possibly best films of 2000 , drunken master 2 ( released in the u . s . as the legend of drunken master ) . unlike drunken master 2 , which stars jackie chan as an adult fei-hong , iron monkey finds a much younger fei-hong ( sze-man tsang ) and his father wong kei-ying ( yen chi dan ) thrust into the middle of iron monkey's fight against oppression . iron monkey succeeds as no kung fu film since drunken master 2 . at times , fighting styles , especially that of monkey himself , do devolve into the ridiculous twinkle-toed floating of films like crouching tiger , hidden dragon , director yuen wo ping eventually remembers to bring his action scenes back to earth . iron monkey is at its heart a hardcore , kung fu action film rather than any kind of drama a la crouching tiger . however , there are brief moments of profoundness shared between characters , such as those that pass between our outlaw hero and his good-hearted but misguided enemy , chief fox . in those moments , and in others , iron monkey manages to transcend its mindless kung fu nature to touch the hearts and minds of its audience . while in no way the equal of a masterpiece like drunken master 2 , iron monkey dances quite nicely to the invading kung fu tune . aka siunin wong fei-hung tsi titmalau ."
"Video: 7-year-old boy steals dad's car to avoid church [UPDATE] Filed under: Sedan , Government/Legal , Videos , Dodge Police in Utah were in for a shock when they spotted an erratic driver recently.

"after watching "" rat race "" last week , i noticed my cheeks were sore and realized that , when not laughing aloud , i had held a grin for virtually all of the film's 112 minutes . saturday night , i attended another sneak preview for the movie and damned if i didn't enjoy it as much the second time as the first . "" rat race "" is a great goofy delight , a dandy mix of energetic performances , inspired sight gags and flat-out silliness . hands down , this is the most fun film of the summer . the movie begins with zippy retro-style opening credits that look like they were torn straight out of a '60s slapstick comedy , featuring animated photos of the cast attached to herky-jerky bodies bounding around the screen . then comes the setup . donald sinclair ( john cleese ) , the extremely rich owner of the venetian hotel and casino in las vegas , enjoys concocting unusual bets for his high rolling clients . to that end , he places a half dozen very special tokens in his slot machines . gathering together the lucky token holders , he explains , "" today you have a chance to play a game where the odds of winning are one in six . "" the competition is simple : each contestant gets a key that opens a locker in silver city , n . m . , containing $2 million in cash . there is a transmitter in every key , so that sinclair and his cronies can keep track of who is ahead . the race has no rules ? whichever contestant reaches the locker first gets the money . since it would be wrong to spoil any of the jokes , let's use the next few paragraphs to profile the racers . decked out in flashy , trashy clothing and sporting big hair , vera baker ( whoopi goldberg ) is in town to reunite with the daughter she gave up for adoption as a baby . she finds that grown-up merrill ( lanai chapman ) is erudite , conservative and more than a little bit wary of this stranger trying to jump into her life . thrown together , it becomes clear that both women share a fierce competitive nature . owen templeton ( cuba gooding jr . ) is currently the most hated man in america . an nfl referee , he cost gamblers all over the country enormous amounts of money by blowing a call in a high-profile game . after escaping from a vengeful cab driver , owen gets to new mexico by masquerading as the driver for a busload of lucy ricardo impersonators heading to a convention . mr . pollini ( rowan atkinson ) is a cheerful , odd little italian man on holiday in america . he also is narcoleptic and falls asleep at the most inopportune times . pollini hitches a ride with zack ( wayne knight ) , a hyper-tense ambulance driver carrying a human heart across country for a transplant operation . randy pear ( jon lovitz ) promised his wife beverly ( kathy najimy ) and two kids a fun-filled vacation in las vegas . fearful that beverly will be angry over his involvement in the race , he claims that he must travel to silver city for a job interview . beverly insists the family stay together , so they hop in the mini-van and tear off into the desert . brothers duane ( seth green ) and blaine ( vince vieluf ) cody are young , crooked and stupid . blaine has a speech impediment due to his poorly self-done tongue piercing , and duane is the only person who can come close to understanding him . the boys will stop at nothing to reach their goal . finally , nick shaffer ( breckin meyer ) is a no-nonsense lawyer-in-training who recruits helicopter pilot tracy faucet ( amy smart ) for the journey . at first glance , they seem blandly wholesome , but all that changes when tracy buzzes the home of her boyfriend shawn ( dean cain ) and spies him swimming with another woman . director jerry zucker ( "" airplane , "" "" ghost "" ) leaps from racer to racer , periodically returning to las vegas where sinclair and mr . grisham ( dave thomas ) , his personality-impaired right hand man , continue cooking up bizarre bets for the gamblers . as with any zucker production , a few jokes fall flat , but the momentum of the comedy zooms past those missteps . high points for me include a bit involving kathy bates as a roadside squirrel salesperson and an intricately set up gag that carries jon lovitz and family from a bizarre museum to an outdoor rally , with an utterly tasteless and screamingly funny pay-off . had i been part of the filmmaking team , i would have ditched a joke where a key is dropped into a baby's clothes and instead had the key get lost in the cleavage of a dozing society matron . it would have drawn the same laugh without the squirm-inducing hint of child molestation . i also would have selected a different band for a concert sequence . my god , do we really need yet another movie with smash mouth performing "" all star ? "" but enough carping . "" rat race "" is a riot , with terrific no-holds-barred performances from the diverse cast . see it , see it again and when the dvd comes out , buy it , because a movie this hilarious will surely have outtakes to die for ."
"i've noticed something lately that i've never thought of before . pseudo- substance - hollywood faking deep meanings in their films . have you ever seen a movie that you really enjoyed , then when you look back , you realize there was something missing ? more and more , filmmakers seem to be putting out well rehearsed , melodramatic films that evoke strong connotations of being a great film , but if you step aside and reflect on your movie going experience , you may just discover nothing more than elegantly presented fluff . i'm not trying to say city of angels is that bad . it had a lot going for it , but somewhere along the way , it faltered . somehow , underneath the seemingly poetic beauty of it all , there was a gigantic hole somebody covered with iridescent performances and glossy cinematography . the predictable ending that shattered our hopes ( even though we saw it coming ) only added to the disappointment . but for over an hour , city of angels is well worth the time . nicolas cage is seth , a guardian angel who , like hundreds ( likely thousands or even millions ) of other angels , spends eternity watching over the citizens of mortality ; humans never aware of how much celestial intervention occurs in their life . meg ryan , in her most subdued performance yet , plays maggie , a doctor who begins to ponder exactly who it is we're fighting against when we fight to keep someone alive . after losing a patient on the surgery table , these questions envelope maggie , and seth , the angel who was there to oversee the patient's transition into the afterlife , is immediately captivated by the doctor . he begins following and observing maggie , falling more and more in love with her everyday . angels , who we quickly learn are not and never were humans , can not experience human sensations such as taste and touch , but they do have the ability to make themselves seen to anyone they desire . seth's adoration is too much to resist , and eventually he does appear to maggie , quite regularly , although such a thing seems taboo among the angelic community . the angels are interestingly presented , all of them dressed in black and more reminiscent of hitmen than traditional glowing white entities , but it's a nice touch that never seems like a mere attempt at uniqueness . cage is a wonderfully versatile actor ( think face/off , raising arizona , and it could happen to you - what a combo ! ) who slips into the role of a heavenly agent quite nicely but threatens sappiness more than once . it's nice to see ryan pick up roles like this and the one in courage under fire . the two aren't very comparable to each other , but they both deviate from her usual "" intelligently ditzy "" romantic comedy roles , and it's an impressive side of ryan movie goers rarely have the chance to enjoy . but even though the two leads do an impressive job , it is dennis franz who grabs us with his interpretation of a hospital patient who knows more than meets the eye . it's a shame that with so much going for it , city of angels falters so much in its final stages , leaving us with the realization that an emotionally incredible movie was out there , they just didn't know quite how to get to it . they struggle for an impacting conclusion and wind up with painful thud rather than an exhilarating high . filmmakers should know your final impression will be the one you linger on , remember , and convey to others thru word of mouth , so after telling us for 60+ minutes that this film is a glorious masterpiece , they sure leave us with a disheartening taste of mediocrity in our mouths . based on the german film wings of desire ( that being the english title , of course ) , city of angels is ninety percent success , enough to make most people forgive its shortcomings , even the devastatingly disappointing ending . most movie goers , the non-cynics anyway , will be too wrapped up in the surreal atmosphere to give criticism to that which needs to be criticized . nonetheless , city of angels is beautifully captivating , which is probably enough to satisfy those poetic viewers who will appreciate a delve into rich emotional territories ."
"synopsis : bobby garfield ( yelchin ) lives in a small town with his mirthless widowed mother ( hope davis ) . bobby's world revolves around his friends , especially the spritely carol ( boorem ) . then one day , a new boarder arrives at bobby's house . ted brautigan ( hopkins ) is an enigmatic man to whom bobby takes an immediate liking . as the bond between bobby and ted deepens , bobby becomes privy to ted's great secret , an event which will change both of their lives forever . review : a small but enchanting movie , "" hearts in atlantis "" easily recalls another king-inspired coming-of-age film , "" stand by me "" , both in terms of its setting and the sentiment it conveys . "" hearts "" is a tribute to the magic of childhood , to those summers when the days seem neverending , and nothing means more than your closest friends . unlike "" stand by me "" , there is a supernatural element to "" hearts "" , but although it is key to the plot , it is not prominent . like "" stand by me "" , this is a mostly character-driven film , and as such it benefits greatly from superb casting . yelchin is very good as bobby , finding a good mix of innocence and resignation . more splendid still is boorem , whom i praised highly for her work in "" along came a spider "" and who is simply radiant here as carol . and then there is hopkins , who despite playing such a quiet , introspective character as ted , nonetheless commands our attention every time he is onscreen . less successful is davis , whose strident elizabeth comes across as overly cartoonish . i also found it odd that bobby and carol's other friend , sully ( whose death as an adult sets up the movie's flashback framing device ) , is paid virtually no attention . but hicks' direction is lovely without being cloying , and despite the movie's general lack of incident , it never ceases to weave its spell over the audience ."
"synopsis : in this movie , steven spielberg , one of today's finest directors , attempts to spice up the 1800s story of a long courtroom battle over the fate of prisoner cinque ( djimon hounsou ) - - a young angry man from sierra leone who was kidnapped into slavery - - and his fellow prisoners . cinque and friends have landed a ship on the shores of america after escaping spanish slave traders , but since the americans don't speak cinque's language , the black men are hauled into court to determine whether or not they are legally slaves . technically , since the international slave trade was outlawed at that time , people like cinque couldn't be kidnapped into slavery ; one had to be born a slave to be legally considered a slave . lawyers baldwin and adams ( matthew mcconaughey and anthony hopkins ) must prove cinque and the others were captured into slavery , rather than born slaves , in order to get them out of prison as free men . three lengthy court cases are portrayed with spielberg's trademark panache - - flashy beginning , lots of facial close-ups , big music , and dramatic imagery . a final speech by adams is followed by an anticlimax where subtitles show what eventually happened to the various characters . opinion : making a fictional movie is easier than making one about real life . in fiction , one invents purposeful , clear-cut good guys and bad guys , puts the fictional characters in conflict , and takes the tale to its exciting conclusion . real life , however , consists of long stretches of boredom with a few dramatic moments and characters who stand around , think thoughts and do nothing , or come and go before events are resolved . spielberg gives us a visually spicy and historically accurate real life story . djimon hounsou and anthony hopkins turn in excellent performances ."
"the police negotiator is the person with the entirely unenviable job of going into ground zero and attempting to talk a dangerous criminal out of doing whatever he or she intends to do . lives are often at stake , and the criminal is usually armed and most likely mentally unstable , prone to turn on the negotiator at a moment's notice . the negotiator must therefore be something of an actor , psychologist , and sham artist , in addition to being a police officer ; he must be able to think on his feet and either work toward the goal of ending the confrontation without violence , or failing that , must be prepared to facilitate the conclusion of the crisis through firepower . most of all , the negotiator must be able to enter a situation with as little intelligence about the scenario as possible , and quickly gain control of the situation , dominate the conversation , and influence the perpetrator into thinking that the end of the conflict is what he really wants . it takes a pretty smart person to do that . but what if the hostage-holding criminal is just as smart ? what if he's also able to think on his feet ? in fact , what if he also knows all the tricks to turning the situation to his favor ? it is this circumstance which forms the basis for f . gary gray's the negotiator . in this film , police negotiator danny roman ( samuel l . jackson ) is tipped off by his partner to corruption within the chicago police force . when his partner turns up shot to death and internal affairs finds incriminating evidence in roman's home , roman becomes the prime suspect of both embezzling from the police disability fund and murder . faced with the scorn of most of the police department , and under close scrutiny by the media , roman is forced to turn in his badge in one of those typical scenes in the captain's office . i don't quite remember if the captain actually said , "" i hate to do this , but . . . "" , although it wouldn't surprise me if he did . luckily , the film soon shakes off the conventionalism and concentrates on the interesting premise mentioned above . after being offered a take-it-or-leave-it deal by the district attorney , roman resolves to prove his innocence by walking into the office of internal affairs inspector niebaum ( j . t . walsh ) , taking him and others hostage , and proclaiming he has been framed . although roman's actions seem forced due to the compressed nature of his motivational build-up , gray redeems himself by involving us with the negotiations between roman and fellow police negotiator chris sabian ( kevin spacey ) which soon ensue . jackson , while a superb actor , is miscast in the role of roman . the actor has become so popular , and so often identified as a protagonist ( notable exceptions can be found , such as in jackie brown ) , that we as an audience have a difficult time believing he will carry out his threats . the script also clearly sets him up as the good guy who is only trying to prove his innocence . how can we believe he's going to shoot a hostage , no matter if the hostage tried to kill him earlier ? unfortunately , this preconception saps the film of some of it's would-be suspenseful moments , and anything good left in those scenes is largely attributed to jackson's acting ability . almost every time he's in a scene , jackson steals it without looking back . when spacey appears , the film has already run about a third of its course . his is an interesting character . made out to be some kind of negotiating superman , our first look at him has him hopelessly trying to get his family moving to set out on vacation . "" i can talk a man out of blowing up the sears tower , but i can't talk my wife out of the bedroom or my daughter off the phone , "" he says . when he gets the call to action , however , he quickly changes gears and becomes the man we expect him to be . soon , his character has to negotiate not only with roman , but also with the swat commander ( david morse ) who is itching to send in a team to take roman out , all the while keeping wary of the fbi agents who are waiting to take over the operation , should negotiations fail . this complex set of pressures are reflected well in sabian the negotiator and spacey the actor . as the second protagonist , spacey measures up nicely . gray really lucked out with this cast . david morse as commander beck , ron rifkin as commander frost , and john spencer as police chief al travis are all more than competent , and can hold their own in scenes with jackson and spacey . the only problem is the bit of typecasting that results from these choices : morse played a similar role in the rock , rifkin played the d . a . in l . a . confidential , and spencer played a police detective in cop land . with the level of acting , however , this can be forgiven . also in the supporting cast , paul giamatti as rudy , one of the hostages , is notable for the comic relief he provides . his character is initially so slimy , and giamatti himself just looks so shifty , that you expect to laugh before he even says anything . fortunately , this doesn't distract from the seriousness of the rest of the film , but instead provides some nice breathers from the level of tension which gray manages to sustain throughout . j . t . walsh , as the suspicious internal affairs inspector , clocks in with one of his final performances . sadly , the talented but underrated actor passed away in late february of this year , and the soon to be released pleasantville will mark his last film . walsh appeared in dozens of movies such as good morning vietnam , backdraft , and nixon . for one of his best performances , check out sling blade , in which he plays a mental patient sharing a ward with billy bob thornton . when jack nicholson accepted his best actor oscar in march , walsh was one of the men to whom he credited his success ( the actors performed together in a few good men ) . the negotiator is actually dedicated to walsh , and while inspector niebaum may not have been his best role , it certainly characterizes the type of character for which walsh had become most famous for playing . in the end , the negotiator has a plotline that parallels it's reality . we're served with the premise that two equally deft negotiators are battling each other to resolve the conflict in the manner which will suit each of them best . as an audience , we're also given a situation where two wonderfully talented actors are thrown into a movie , and we'd like to see if one will dominate the film . both provide some pretty good entertainment ."
"plot : a young man who loves heavy metal music and especially the band steel dragon , to whom he's devoted a tribute band in which he sings , gets launched into stardom when the real group get rid of their lead singer and call on him to take his place . critique : i'm a sucker for movies like this . a young man with a humble background and lofty dreams , works hard , devotes the time , the energy and the patience , and ultimately hits it big-time . in the case of this film , our boy loves a certain heavy metal band and as luck would have it ( yup , luck always finds its way into these types of equations , although generally tied very closely to hard work ) , they need a new singer . his entry and adaptation to the whole "" rock 'n roll "" lifestyle fills the rest of the film and is really fun to watch . although i will preface this by saying that one thing that would definitely enhance your appreciation for this film is your own love ( or past love ) of heavy metal music and the whole scene around it . metal was one of my first loves as a teen and even though the genre of music isn't that prominent anymore , i still check out my motley crue , twisted sister and anthrax cds every now and again . that's not to say that you won't like this film if you don't like the music , but the music and live performances from the band , play a big part in the movie , and i for one , had a blast watching and listening to it all . but the even greater draw in this film is the standout performance given here by mark wahlberg . wow , hand this fella some major props , as he totally becomes this heavy metal geek/god ( incidentally , metal god was the film's original title , and a much better one if you ask me ) . he is this movie and i was quite taken by his character pretty much the whole way through . he came off like a regular guy with extremely passionate goals and work ethic , who was willing to do anything in order to fulfill his dreams . aniston was also surprisingly good as the girlfriend ( and the romance angle between them was sweet ) , but she didn't pull me in hard enough during their emotional scenes . i was also impressed by some of the "" real "" musicians who played in the film ( zakk wylde from ozzy osbourne , jeff pilson from dokken , stephan jenkins from third eye blind , blas elias from slaughter ) , but actor dominic west as kirk cuddy made the biggest impression among the band members . it's to note that this film was based on a real-life tale of a young man who used to sing in a judas priest cover band and then went on to become their actual singer ( their original singer also admitted to being gay , as in this film ) . just for the record , i'm certainly not recommending this film for its originality or surprise elements , since most of this stuff has already been covered in some way or another in other movies , but because it's a fun , uplifting , well-paced movie with a solid central showing by wahlberg and energetic live performances . oh yeah , and for those who dig the "" heavier "" side of music , the soundtrack also rocks ! ! you see . . . dreams can come true . . . where's joblo coming from ? almost famous ( 8/10 ) - blow ( 8/10 ) - boogie nights ( 9/10 ) - detroit rock city ( 8/10 ) - girlfight ( 6/10 ) - goodfellas ( 10/10 )"
"carry on matron is the last great carry-on film in my opinion . made in 1972 , it still features most of the regulars of this genre . sid james plays the head of a gang of crooks intent on stealing contraceptive pills from the local maternity hospital and selling them off to make a profit , kenneth williams is sir bernard cutting , head of the hospital but also a hypochondriac , hattie jacques re-takes her role as matron , and charles hawtrey is the psychiatrist dr . goode . the jokes come in fast and so do the laughs , with humorous antics between the matron and sir bernard . this time , williams is after matron ( jacques ) when he needs to prove himself that he is a man after visiting dr . goode . the doctor ( hawtrey ) is sworn to secrecy : - "" i assure you , that anything you say to me today will go in one ear and straight out of the other ! "" bernard thinks he is having a sex change and needs to prove himself . there are great cameos from joan sims , an expectant mother who is many weeks overdue and is eating constantly in every scene , and from kenneth connor as the expectant father who still thinks he's at work ( at the railway station ) . sid james' gang including cyril his son ( kenneth cope ) try to find out where the pills are by getting cyril to dress up as a nurse and live in at the nurses home . he has to share a room with nurse ball ( barbara windsor ) and she soon sees through him ! the film ends with the attempted robbery of the hospital's pills with panic ensuing . there are good performances by hattie jacques as the matron , however her character seems a little more subdued and quieter than her previous 'matron's' . williams is , as usual , on top form , but sid james isn't given a very good part in this movie and i would forgive anyone to forget that he was in the movie at all . the same does not go for charles hawtrey , for although he only first appears in the movie after 30 minutes gone and has scarce screen time , he seems to steal every scene he is in . by not making use of sid james and barbara windsor's talent to full effect , the film seems to flounder , but it certainly makes up for it with it's good storyline and it's other appealing characters . this film is genuinely funny and i could watch it again and again and not get bored !"
"the ultimate match up between good and evil , "" the untouchables "" is an excellent movie because it looks deeper into an already examined rivalry . based on the 1959 television show of the same title , "" the untouchables "" may be an exaggeration of the real life events that took place , but it fits together perfectly with some beautifully filmed action sequences , some excellent acting , a memorable score , and a clever script . the film takes place in chicago during the prohibition era where mobsters led by the ruthless al capone run an underground market of liquor to the demanding public . elliot ness and a small force of men known as the untouchables attempt the impossible by trying to stop capone and trying to maintain peace and order . however , as ness soon learns , in order to stabilize peace , you have to bend a few laws . the fact that capone is evil is very apparent from the first few scenes . the film begins with capone , played perfectly by deniro , declaring that he is not a violent man and he is a firm believer in following all laws . the film then quickly transfers to the next scene in which one of capone's men bombs a restaurant that contains many innocent people including a little girl . from this point we know capone is evil , not only because he kills without hesitation , but also because he is a lying bastard . right from the first five minutes of the film , de palma has created a hatred towards capone and he shows that this man must be brought down at all costs . this developed hatred is before the film's hero , ness , is even introduced . i found this approach to be very clever because in a small duration of time there is a great amount of admiration for ness and an equal amount of hatred for capone . the film only gets better from this point . with the formation of the untouchables , there is a group of men wearing long , dark overcoats and hats . they walk in unison and they only look forward . as they walk down the streets they are observed and feared by citizens . holding shot guns and pistols in their hands to stop criminals , this image of vigilantes must have influenced future films . one that comes to mind is "" the matrix "" when neo , morpheus , trinity , and the rest of the gang first come into the virtual world . wearing more futuristic outfits of the same 1930's style , the similarities between these two are countless . "" the untouchables "" has some of the hippest , bravest heroes in any action film . the four members were the only ones willing to go against capone's army . each member of this special group also had their own characteristics that separated them from others . elliot ness , played with perfect ingenuity by kevin costner , is a character that surely grows during the course of the film . he begins as a man who is determined to follow all laws no matter how unfair they may be . however , as the film develops so does ness . his beliefs involving the law are shattered when he realizes that those he trusted are actually members of the other side . he also begins to lose his stability when his adversaries begin to murder his friends . his anger becomes so thunderous that he can no longer hold it in . sean connery , who won an academy award for best supporting actor in his role , plays malone , an aging cop who decides to make one final run as a member of the untouchables . malone acts as a mentor to ness . he teaches him "" the chicago way "" to do things ; when they attack with a knife , you attack with a gun . connery plays his character with the exact amount of wit and experience needed . andy garcia does a wonderful job as george stone , a young man who is just becoming a police officer . as ness grows , he begins to teach stone some valuable lessons that malone once taught him . charles martin smith is also fantastic as the final member who attempts to use an income tax offense against capone . smith is perfect for his role as he adds some valuable comic relief to the film . the action scenes are also some of the most beautifully choreographed i have ever seen . also very similar to "" the matrix , "" they are exciting and intense . >from a western-like battle to the famous confrontation at the train station steps , the scenes are well thought out and well executed . the score during these scenes ingeniously adds to the excitement . its pounding drum beats act as a rhythm for the actors . the combination of image and music is very impressive and also very effective . although the real life untouchables may have been excessively glorified , this film is pure entertainment and contains a unique blend of great acting , great directing , and great action . some scenes ( capone and the baseball bat , the train station ) have stuck in my mind for years and seeing them again will only make them more vivid ."
"having not seen , "" who framed roger rabbit "" in over 10 years , and not remembering much besides that i liked it then , i decided to rent it recently . watching it i was struck by just how brilliant a film it is . aside from the fact that it's a milestone in animation in movies ( it's the first film to combine real actors and cartoon characters , have them interact , and make it convincingly real ) and a great entertainment it's also quite an effective comedy/mystery . while the plot may be somewhat familiar the characters are original , especially baby herman , and watching them together is a lot of fun . the story begins in hollywood in 1947 . cartoon star roger rabbit is blowing takes and having trouble keeping his mind on work , so hard-boiled private detective eddie valiant ( bob hoskins ) is called in by studio head r . k . maroon ( alan tilvern ) to try to help get roger's mind back on work . maroon thinks that roger's wife , jessica's , possible unfaithfulness to him might be the cause of distraction and tells eddie to get some photos of her in the act before it costs him any more money in reshoots . valiant takes some photos of jessica playing , `patty cake' with marvin acme ( stubby kaye ) , the owner of toontown ( where all of the cartoon characters live ) and takes them to maroon . upon seeing them , roger is emotionally destroyed and soon after acme is found dead and roger rabbit is the prime suspect . the rest of the movie follows valiant and roger as they run around town ( and eventually toontown ) trying to clear roger's good name . along the way they meet judge doom ( christopher lloyd ) a judge-jury-and executioner type who's out to get roger and has discovered the one and only way to kill a `toon . ' `who framed roger rabbit' won 4 academy awards including a special achievement award for richard williams for animation direction and creation of the cartoon characters ( williams and his teams went through the film frame by frame and hand drew the cartoon characters in ) . director robert zemekis must be given an equal amount of praise for overseeing the entire production , which included hundreds of animators . also bob hoskins' performance should be credited . he , in addition to the rest of the human cast , finds the right note to play in all of the scenes with his cartoon co-stars . according to the internet movie database , hoskins studied his young daughter to learn how to act with imaginary characters and i guess his hard work paid off . `who framed roger rabbit' is a rare film . one that not only presented a great challenge to the filmmakers but one that can be enjoyed by the whole family ( although some very young viewers may be a little scared by judge doom ) . do yourself a favor and rent it , `p-p-p-p-please .

"there's something about ben stiller that makes him a popular choice among casting directors these days . stiller currently has three projects in circulation , and what other actor can lay claim to that ? he's in "" there's something about mary , "" which i * still * haven't seen . and he's in the acerbic "" your friends & neighbors , "" playing a talkative , sexually-frustrated drama coach called jerri . now there's "" permanent midnight , "" in which stiller plays another jerry , this one a heroin-addicted television writer , last name stahl . there's also something about this industry that pushes bankable stars like stiller into doing drug-addiction pictures the minute they've proved themselves commercially . ewan mcgregor springs to mind who , after successful turns in "" emma "" and "" brassed off , "" received greater respect and admiration for his mind-blowing realization as renton in danny boyle's transatlantic junk-fest , "" trainspotting . "" the philosophy appears to be a simple one : if you want 'em to be taken seriously , make 'em do drugs . "" permanent midnight "" is based on the true life experiences of jerry stahl , a successful hollywood writer who , in the mid-eighties , had a $5 , 000-a-week job churning out plotlines for disposable tv sitcoms and a $6 , 000-a-week heroin habit . a habit , in stahl's own words , "" the size of utah . "" as stahl , stiller contributes a commanding performance . unlike "" trainspotting , "" which was successful in having it both ways by chronicling both the highs and the lows of heroin abuse , "" permanent midnight "" instead focuses on the concept of drug addiction as maintenance . one of the earliest observations in the film is a casual reference to "" naked lunch "" author william s . burroughs who , when asked why he shoots up first thing in the morning responds , "" so i can shave . "" stahl rarely appears to be puncturing veins for the thrill of it all in "" permanent midnight "" ; it's so he can talk to his mother on the phone , show up for work on time , even pay his bills . while the film itself occasionally wobbles around along with stahl , the writing ( adapted from stahl's autobiography by director david veloz ) is controlled and pointed . "" permanent midnight "" shows how stahl moved from new york to l . a . to--again in the author's words-- "" escape the drug scene "" ( yeah , right ) ; why he entered into a convenient marriage with a british tv exec ( elizabeth hurley , so impossibly polite you'd swear her single profanity was dubbed ) ; and that he conceived a child in between his random hirings and firings . stahl narrates all this in a motel bedroom to a sympathetic lover called kitty ( norristown's own maria bello ) with whom he spent some rehab time . janeane garofalo is wasted--and miscast--as a heavily-bespectacled hollywood talent agent who fails to get her hooks into the doped-up wordsmith , and that's stahl himself playing a jaded clinic counselor . stiller , unshaven ( burroughs take note ) and with lots of mascara around the eyes , has stahl stumble through the film looking like a train wreck but , to his credit , never once pushes his pill-popping , needle-jabbing performance over the top . the ubiquitous stiller is the reason to see "" permanent midnight "" ; a dark , comic , and strangely absorbing study of assisted living ."
"Tesla announces 'World's Best Service and Warranty Program,' hints at future 500-mile battery Filed under: EV/Plug-in , Tesla Motors , USA Tesla Motors has just revealed the latest edition of it 5-part announcement trilogy . Whereas the previous first installment had to do with the company's new leasing program , this episode is all about service and warranty, comes gift-wrapped in the glittery descriptor of ""World's Best,"" and is accompanied by hints of a future battery upgrade. The new plan improves on the California automaker's service program by adding a valet service that brings you a top-spec Model S Performance - or a Tesla Roadster , if you prefer - to temporarily replace your personal vehicle while it's being serviced. CEO Elon Musk states that this fleet of Model S service vehicles, which will initially number about 100, will ideally be less than three months old and also be available for immediate sale. Like your loaner more than your own car? You can keep it, paying ""a price that is lower by 1% per month of age and $1 per mile"" for your new ride and taking, likely, a similar hit on your trade-in. Musk hinted that a 500-mile battery would not be an unreasonable thing to expect in four or five years. Not only should the purchase scheme keep the loaner fleet nice and fresh, it may also create a cache of certified pre-owned inventory for buyers who are looking for a deal on a Tesla that starts at $69,900 from the factory, or who would rather not wait a couple months for a new, made-to-order car. As well as no-travel hassle, Tesla has also made its $600 annual service optional without effecting the standard 5-year/50,000-mile warranty. The company has also made the battery portion of the warranty unconditional, meaning that, if you manage to somehow turn it into a useless brick (something that should be quite difficult to accomplish with the Model S ), you will get a replacement unit of equal capacity free of charge. Speaking of battery capacity, during the media call, Mr. Musk also offered some hope for those anxious for packs that hold more energy than the current EPA-estimated 265-mile/85 kilowatt-hour packs now available. In response to a question about upcoming technology improvements, he hinted that a 500-mile battery would not be an unreasonable thing to expect in four or five years. He then added that, eventually, Tesla would likely offer owners the opportunity to upgrade their vehicles with longer-range capabilities. It all sounds pretty good to us, and we can't help but think if this upstart company keeps it up, surpassing sales of the Chevy Volt might seem a minor accomplishment.

It is a lot for regular middle-class folks like us. BUT, the car wasn't made for us. It was made for people who would buy a top-of-the-line Mercedes, BMW, Porsche, etc. Being that Tesla is a brand new company, they've been forced to make their first several models to appeal to only those people who can afford ultra high-end sports cars and luxury sedans (ie. The Roadster and Model S, respectively). This was done because they didn't have enough capitol to roll out the 50,000 vehicles it would've needed to do in order to satisfy that kind of demand. So they started out appealing to the ultra rich on the Roadster and used the capitol on those sales to create the S class. That capitol also allowed them to purchase a state-of-the-art factory and the ability to ramp up production. Now their using the capitol from the S sales to ramp up supercharging stations throughout the US to answer the range issues. They're also coming out with a sport utility version of the S next year and will parley those sales in order to make a much cheaper sedan (comparable to perhaps a BMW i series). The hope is to finally make a sedan perhaps closer to a Toyota Camry. But they will first need to scale up to the type of factory infrastructure that GM, Ford & Chrysler has in order to be able to compete and match the supply with the demand (which is VERY challenging for a small start-up). That being said; if they keep making a quality product, they will be very successful. And deservedly so. As for range being an issue. I think 265-300 miles of range for an electric car that can be charged at night while your sleeping for 75% less than gasoline is AWESOME! DOT statistics show that most people don't drive more than 20 miles per day. On the occasion that you have to take a long trip, there is (and will be many more) supercharging stations with which to charge up. So if you can afford it. My opinion is... Nothing beats this car. 3 hours ago Report abuse Permalink 2 replies to Jonathan's comment Tesla and their battery source have run out of money. The battery companies sponsored by the US taxpayers are out of business. Fisker, a Tesla electric car competitor, similarly high priced, is also in bankruptcy. Fiskers also was sponsored by the Obama gang of academics, with no business acumen. Billions have been spent on these two car companies and the battery suppliers, monies the US taxpayers have lost.

You have already been corrected many times so that means that you are actively creating FUD. Every one of your statements about Tesla can be proven wrong with a minimal amount of research. You are a troll. You are trying to create misinformation. Tesla received all of their loan and are actively paying it back. They have not and will not be asking for any more Federal money. You think you'd be trolling a Ford website since they received 12 times more Federal money than Tesla did. Ford got $5.9 billion for their loan that they will be repaying over the next 25 years! Tesla has vowed to pay back their loan in 5 years. They are currently paying back $15 million every three months with $30 million paid so far. Continued success means that they will continue to pay down the loan. But you are so afraid of them that you would prefer they fail to fit your sick and twisted agenda of fear. You are a cowardly troll.

"by phil curtolo mel gibson ( braveheart ) gave a gripping performance as the father of a young kidnapped boy in ron howard's ransom . gibson plays tom mullen , a wealthy business tycoon whose past actions are coming back to haunt him as a deranged psychopath , played by gary sinise ( forrest gump ) , and his band of low-life thugs kidnap his only son for $2 million . tom and his wife , kate , played by rene russo ( tin cup ) were instructed not to inform the police , but they contacted the fbi . minutes later , an elite team of agents led by delroy lindo ( broken arrow ) are in tom's house and wiring every phone . the plot sounds average , just like most other kidnap movies that you've already seen , and it was nothing more than that . that is until about half-way through the movie . suddenly , tom goes to the fox 5 news room and makes a live broadcast saying , "" this is your ransom . but this is as close as you will ever get to it . instead , i am offering this money as a reward on your head , dead or alive . "" at this point , the plot thickened , and the unusually slow start of the film turned into a suspense-filled action film with great stunts . the last half of the film is very well done . another thing that carries this film are the superb performances by gibson and sinise , as they collide in a game of wits over their cellular phones for most of the movie . owen gleiberman of entertainment weekly commented on the subject : "" it makes you wonder what kidnappers did before cell phones .

"one can not observe a star trek movie and expect to see serious science fiction . the purpose of star trek is to provide flashy , innocent fun . sometimes the stories are compelling . sometimes they're not . but , with the exception of the first film in the series ( which provides little more than endless shots of amazed faces ) , i've never been bored by any of the enterprise's numerous missions . star trek : insurrection is no exception . the film has gotten some negative reviews ( a friend of mine actually thinks it's the worst in the series ) , but i'm not really sure why . it's an exciting , often hilarious movie that engaged me and left me ready for the next star trek film . some say it's a bit too light , and more of a long episode than a film . others say the special effects are cheesy and that it's boring . i simply enjoyed the film . insurrection , which is the second film to feature strictly the next generation cast , introduces us to a race of people called the ba'ku ; the ba'ku are very old ( most of them are about three hundred years old ) , but they actually appear younger with age due to strange radiation in the rings of their planet . of course , these peaceful people can't horde this fountain of youth all for themselves ? leave it up to their archenemies , the son'a , led by ru'afo ( f . murray abraham ) , to mess everything up . the son'a , who are horribly disfigured and rely on daily reconstructive surgery to be aesthetically acceptable , strike a deal with the federation to move the ba'ku elsewhere and exploit the secret to keep their race from dying . that's when captain picard ( patrick stewart ) steps in : he realizes that moving the ba'ku would kill them ( it also helps that he falls in love with a ba'ku woman ( donna murphy ) ) . so , with his trusty crew , picard defies the federation to keep the ba'ku in their natural habitat . when dealing with a series with as much history as this , it's not entirely necessary to re-introduce your characters with each episode . this is why i believe non-fans have a hard time getting into star trek ; in order to enjoy it , one has to understand how to approach it . insurrection , however , does a surprisingly good job of us new aspects of the characters . stewart is bold as always , a magnetic screen presence and perfectly capable of holding an entire film together . jonathan frakes , who also directed , is funny as commander riker ; a subplot with data ( brent spiner ) discovering his lost childhood is fairly interesting ; and abraham makes a perfect star trek villain , overacting like crazy . frakes showed similar aptitude for direction in first contact ; insurrection is an exciting film , with some really attractive special effects and a lot of good action . this is apparently the first star trek film to utilize computer animation , and the result is very pleasing to the eye : particularly in the climactic scenes , in which the son'a employ a giant space ship to suck up the rings of the ba'ku planet , the special effects have a clean , impressively sharp look . if i have any complaint about the film , it's that it tries to take a moral stance when it's not very appropriate to do so . i don't think it's that big of a deal that the federation wanted to move 600 ba'ku in order to save the lives of thousands . better yet , why couldn't they have co-existed ? insurrection feels a little to light to spring these kinds of big moral questions on the audience . with it's inherent camp factor , the star trek series doesn't seem well-equipped to deal with issues like this . i prefer to just enjoy the spectacle ."
"a fully loaded entertainment review - website coming in july ! >from ace ventura to truman burbank , jim carrey has run the whole gamut of comic , yet sympathetic , characters . 1996's the cable guy was supposed to be his big "" breakthrough "" role from zany humor into darker , more dramatic acting . as most everyone knows , the results were , well , less-than-stellar . not only did the film not do so hot at the box office , but it was also panned by critics . as far as i know , gene siskel and i are the only ones willing to admit that we dug it . the first time i saw the cable guy , in theatres , i was in super critic-mode , and didn't really like it . however , due to the fact that hbo shows the movie every single day , i've had time to lean back , relax , and take in the film . and to my surprise , it grew on me . the plot is rather simple : broderick plays a guy named steven who befriends his cable guy , played by carrey , then is stalked by him when steven tries to break off the relationship . see , steven's been having some problems with his girlfriend , robin ( leslie mann ) , and he doesn't think he has any more room in his life for a new friend . also , some of the cable guy's antics have been creeping him out . carrey , as the cable guy , gives steven various aliases , which later we find out are all tv characters : larry tate , chip douglas , ricky ricardo , etc . he apparently lives in his cable van , and while many critics didn't enjoy this newer , darker , less-manic performance from carrey , i thought it was interesting and rather well-done . for me , its not the movie as a whole that's enjoyable , but rather several individual scenes : a karaoke jam at steven's apartment , a medieval fight at a theme restaurant , and a bathroom beating ( a la liar , liar ) , just to name a few . perhaps the fact that more of carrey's humorous side comes out during these scenes is what makes them so funny . and if you really want to see something , you've got to hear his version of jefferson airplane's "" somebody to love "" , sung at the aformentioned karaoke jam . the cable guy has its bad spots , like most any movie . i didn't particularly like steven's girlfriend , and i felt that more focus should have been used on the relationship between steven and his best friend . also , the ending , while having you fooled for a moment , is rather contrived , and somewhat dissapointing . still , i found the cable guy to be a worthwhile venture ; if you're at the video store and can't think of anything to rent , i suggest you try it out . or if you have hbo , just wait till it comes on ( you won't have to wait long . ) hell , that's what i do every day ."
"when bulworth ended , i allowed myself a sigh of relief : ? it is possible for me to enjoy political satire . ? there have been several recent political films that didn't do a whole lot for me -- wag the dog , for instance , i found to be an intelligent but heartless film , while primary colors is unbearable and unwatchable in its awfulness . ? bulworth is a far better film than these , both in its execution and lasting impression . ? it's a tremendously funny and intelligent picture , but it also has an emotional center -- writer/director/star warren beatty allows the audience to identify with his character , and , in turn , we like him and actually care about the story . ? beatty plays incumbent democratic senator jay billington bulworth ; the film opens and we see bulworth sobbing as he watches his television spots over and over again . ? he hasn't slept in days , nor has he eaten , and , almost instantaneously , he goes insane . ? he's not stark raving mad ( not outright , anyway ) , but he's definitely bonkers . ? it's the final weekend of his campaign , and his assistant , murphy ( oliver platt ) has written him a speech to feed to a group of black people in a church in the ghetto . ? bulworth begins the speech , but suddenly goes off track and just starts being honest . ? "" you mean , "" one lady asks , "" the democratic party doesn't care about the african american community ? "" ? "" well , "" he shouts , laughing , "" isn't that obvious ? "" the story is propelled by a device in which bulworth puts out a contract on his own life ( he muses later that it's a bad thing to make decisions when you're suicidal ) ; he keeps seeing a man in sunglasses ( graham beckel ) whom he believes to be the hitman . ? bulworth also meets nina ( halle berry ) with whom he becomes infatuated . ? suddenly , in the short span of this weekend , bulworth's no-nonsense "" truth in politics "" methods become a national sensation , and he shoots ahead in the polls despite the fact that he's appearing on television wearing gang clothes and spewing more profanity than coherent sentences . beatty's work on both sides of the camera is excellent . ? his script and direction are both extremely sharp , as is the surprisingly strong characterization of bulworth himself . ? here is a man who's reached his limit , and his way of lashing back is by screwing over the entire political structure . ? i like that the film doesn't take a clear shot at any of the political parties or affiliations , but at politics in general and how everything is run by the rich ( although the anti-rich sentiments do get a bit tiresome by the end of the film ) . ? some of the segments are simply hilarious , such as a lengthy rap that he delivers at a luncheon dedicated to him . ? much of the film is completely absurd , but that's the fun part about it . ? it's an angry , serious film at the core , but the package that beatty has created is so much more accessible than recent attempts in the genre . ? what adds to this feeling is beatty's portrayal of bulworth ; this is a performance that deserves recognition on a higher scale . ? beatty is so much fun to watch here -- he's always funny , but he's also subtle in ways that flesh out his character without dialogue or hugely noticeable actions . ? beatty is so good that bulworth , despite his shortcomings as a human being , is an entirely sympathetic and likable character almost from the beginning . the supporting cast is vast and colorful . ? berry is luminous , as always , and adds to her repertoire of solid supporting roles . ? don cheadle has a good role as a drug dealer who uses gun-toting toddlers to do his dirty work . ? oliver platt is an actor who should be careful , for someday i fear he may induce a heart attack with the intensity of his acting ( though he's very funny to watch ) . ? paul sorvino adds the southern accent to his list of mastered inflections . is bulworth offensive ? ? i suppose some may see it that way . ? i wasn't offended by the film , but then again , i hardly care about politics . ? i think that people who find this film offensive will just be blindsided by the honesty of the story . ? the film isn't perfect , of course -- the ending didn't quite work for me , and the a few of the scenes between bulworth and nina feel forced ( although the eclectic dance sequence is fantastic ) . ? but these are minor quibbles about an otherwise brilliant film . ? bulworth is a smart , uproariously funny picture that proves to me that political satire can scratch far deeper than the surface . ?"
"call 911 for the cliche police if you must , but the eyes are the window to the soul . the finest actors working in films are those who can command the screen with a gaze : paul newman , ralph fiennes , anthony hopkins , morgan freeman . you look at these men on screen and you can tell without them saying a word that there is something going on in their minds , that the characters they play are real human beings . we will never have a chance to discover if tupac shakur could have been a great actor , but he had that unique quality in his eyes . in gridlock'd , an oddly effective combination of gritty drama and social satire , shakur and his co-star tim roth take sketchy characters and make them exciting to watch through the pure energy of their talent and chemistry . shakur and roth play ezekiel "" spoon "" whitmore and alexander "" stretch "" rome , two detroit buddies who share a spoken word/jazz trio , an apartment and a drug addiction with cookie ( thandie newton ) . when a new year's eve party ends with cookie comatose after a drug overdose , spoon and stretch begin to wonder if they are living on borrowed time . they soon make a new year's resolution to get into rehab , but that proves to be easier said than done . as though the temptation to fix were not hindrance enough , spoon and stretch also find their attempts to get clean hitting a road block of bureaucracy , confusion and red tape . the government might be the least of their obstacles , however , as they find themselves suspects in the murder of a drug dealer , and on the run from a nasty thug ( vondie curtis hall ) . in order for you to buy into gridlock'd at all , you have to accept it as a surreal odyssey rather than as urban realism ; unless spoon and stretch sleep through an entire day at the hospital after bringing in cookie , they are going to government offices on new year's day , in which case they should be thankful they get any help at all . gridlock'd may actually be a response to the fatuous social commentary of another urban odyssey , 1991's falling down , which found a besieged middle class white male venting his righteous anger against the system during a trek through inner city los angeles . in falling down , michael douglas' d-fens ( the character's personalized license plate , echoed in gridlock'd by the drug lord d-reper's plates ) whips out a gun because he can't get breakfast at mcdonald's ; in gridlock'd , spoon and stretch are unarmed against the demands placed on them before they can get into a rehab center . and where the unhinged d-fens became a heroic surrogate for audiences , writer/director vondie curtis hall refuses to let spoon and stretch off the hook for their own part in the situation . one bureaucrat responds to a tirade from stretch with the question , "" do you expect the world to stop . . . just because you picked _today_ to clean up ? "" the world in gridlock'd is just as frustrating as the world in falling down , but the cathartic moments yield no easy answers this time . hall has some interesting things to say about what we expect from the system , but perhaps not enough of them . a significant chunk of gridlock'd is devoted to spoon and stretch's flight from d-reper and from the police , and those sub-plots serve up some thoroughly predictable moments . in one scene , stretch scares off d-reper by getting chummy with a police officer ; another presents that old chestnut of the two mistakenly-suspected heroes in a public place watching a television news report of the crime which shows their pictures . the entire sequence of events seems designed merely as an excuse to get spoon and stretch running , while the other primary plot has them standing in line or sitting down much of the time . hall also plays with gratuitous inserts of drug paraphernalia and flashbacks to the day before the film's main events , perhaps making a particular effort to point out the talent the characters are wasting through self-destructive behavior . oh , the irony of it . tupac shakur made a career in music and movies playing the hard case , and living the life to back it up . in gridlock'd , shakur gets the chance to play someone who has seen enough of the way his life could go to know that it scares him . spoon is an idea for a character at best as written by hall , but shakur displays an intelligence and survival instinct which struggle with his addiction . mostly it comes through those eyes , eyes with none of the hardness you might expect from the infamous gangsta . it is spoon who plays conscience to stretch's pure appetite , and roth plays stretch with a gleeful self-destructiveness ( he reveals that he is hiv positive even as he is preparing to shoot up again ) which is as much an obstacle to spoon's goal as any agency or enemy . gridlock'd's most cruelly comic scene finds stretch "" helping "" spoon get into an emergency room by repeatedly stabbing him with a tiny pocket knife , and it becomes an appropriate symbol for how the company he keeps has slowly drained the life out of him . with friends like that , spoon doesn't need enemies , and shakur looks at stretch with the tired eyes of a man who has seen too much . the tragedy now is that we won't get more chances to see those eyes again ."
"hilarious , ultra-low budget comedy from film school dropout kevin smith chronicles a day in the life of two convenience store slackers ( brian o'halloran and jeff anderson ) . they spend most of their day ignoring customers while discussing everything from fellatio to self-fulfillment . the premise is strictly sitcom and the photography is grainy as all get-out , but you could spend ten times the film's budget ( a reported $27 , 000 ) and still not get dialogue half as good as this . originally rated nc-17 for language . not recommended for viewers with sensitive ears . killing zoe =========== remake reservoir dogs as a french art film and you're halfway to killing zoe , writer/director roger avary's slow-moving story of a failed bastille day bank robbery . eric stoltz stars as an american in paris who gets in * way * over his head when hooks up with a band of nihilistic bank robbers . he's the safecracker who's blissful unaware that the bank job is a botch job from the word go . though intriguing on all fronts , the film is paced at half the speed of pulp fiction , which avary co-wrote with quentin tarantino . in english and french . the road to wellville ===================== based on the novel by t . coraghessan boyle , the road to wellville doesn't go very far . bowels , bowels , and more bowels are explored by dr . john harvey kellogg ( a buck-toothed and bespectacled anthony hopkins ) , who , in the early 1900's , advocated abstinence , vegetarianism , and frequent defecation . he also invented the cornflake . really . checking-in to kellogg's battle creek sanitarium are matthew broderick and bridget fonda , just two of the many well-known faces in this failed comedy . leave your laughter at the door and you can marvel at the unfunny antics of john cusack , michael lerner , lara flynn boyle , john neville , and dana carvey . the art direction is impeccable and some of the early sequences are amusing , but the novelty quickly wears off as writer/director alan parkers tries his darnedness to turn doo-doo into drama . what he ends up with is something that i can't print here . phew ! stargate ======== lawrence of arabia meets star wars . this epic sci-fi film is more sheer spectacle than anything else . director roland emmerich ( universal solider ) shamelessly rips off lucas and spielberg and just about any other cosmic cliche that he can lay his hands on . the film is overlong , the characters are cardboard , and the script is filled with some of the most laughable details in modern sci-fi history . that said , there's still plenty to watch here . sci-fi fans should enjoy the sculpted sands , the morphing headdresses , and a surprisingly spunky james spader . he plays the egyptologist who gets to prove his theory that that "" somebody else "" built the pyramids . less interesting are co-stars kurt russell and jaye davidson of crying game fame . star trek generations ===================== trek fans may be more forgiving , but , for the rest of us , the sluggish star trek generations is a mixed bag at best . the story is interesting , but each scene goes too long . the cast is earnest , but the direction lacks punch . and so on . ( the best example of the latter is a klingon comeuppance that delivers none of the impact of a similar scene in star trek ii . ) original enterprise captain james t . kirk appears on both ends of the story , though they cut the scene where shatner turns to the screen to plead "" get a life .

"for those of us who weren't yet born when the 1960's rock 'n' rolled around , monterey pop affords an affectionate glimpse of the music that influenced our parents to be hippies . from otis redding to jimi hendrix , janis joplin to the mamas and the papas , and jefferson airplane to the who , this documentary is jam-packed with contagious energy . but i give fair warning that i will reveal the ending , which does not do the rest of the film the justice it deserves . shot in 1969 at an outdoor concert that precluded woodstock , the film defies the stereotype of the general population at the time . sure , some have painted their faces and smoke joints , but d . a . pennebaker ( the war room , moon over broadway ) surprisingly chooses to show a broad spectrum of the audience . no matter who is watching , it all comes back to the talented musicians that stir your soul . the excitement starts before the music even begins . a young girl is cleaning thousands of seats and when asked why by an interviewer , she replies that she feels lucky to do so . there are moments of organized craziness as john phillips , leader of the mamas and the papas and one of the concert organizers , tries to get in touch with dionne warwick . and when one band is tuning up , a member remarks , "" finally , a decent sound system ! "" you can tell just by watching these first few moments that this show isn't about vanity , it's about playing the music you love to those who have an appreciation for it , a two-way street . this interaction between audience and performer continues throughout the film and becomes infectious to the audience . it's impossible to tear your eyes away from janis joplin as she belts out her ballad about love being a ball and chain . and while the lyrics to "" wild thing "" may not be all that complicated , watching jimi hendrix mime having sex with his guitar is as captivating as otis redding singing about love . even if you don't recognize every band you see on stage , you can imagine being as enthralled by their work as the public sitting in those seats . the only drawback to the film is the ending , which unfortunately i must reveal . all the other bands , big names then and still today , got approximately 7 to 10 minutes of screen time . in contrast , the last band on camera , a wholly forgettable one , gets an entire 18 minutes of screen time . for a film that's only 78 minutes long , that's too large of a chunk , especially when previous acts are much more stimulating . all in all , monterey pop is a precious , rare look at a time period that still holds sway over us . the variety of music , as well as the beautifully shot performances , are easy to become immersed in . if there was ever any question as to why most of these bands were so popular , this is quickly dispelled . it's almost depressing to think that music this moving doesn't get made much anymore . instead we're stuck with * nsync , the backstreet boys , and jennifer lopez , all of whom should have stuck with modeling ."
"the most common ( and in many cases the only ) complaint against francis ford coppola's 1972 masterpiece the godfather is glamorising of mafia , which is presented as an institution guided by ancient tradition and virtues like honour , loyalty and solidarity more suitable for some gentler , kinder ages . martin scorsese , another italoamerican moviemaker , confronted that perspective with his own , more down-to-earth vision of mafia in 1973 mean streets , movie that dealt with lower echelons of organised crime . unfortunately for scorsese , his film was unspectacular and too artsy to compete with coppola's influence on mafia portrayals in the movies . seventeen years later scorsese returned to mean streets of new york with another film that dealt with darker side of american organised crime . this film was goodfellas , epic black comedy which is today considered as one of the best and most influential films of 1990s . goodfellas owes some of its initial success and popularity to the fact that it was based on the true story , told in best-seller book wiseguy by nicholas pileggi ( who would co-write the screenplay for the film ) . the book , as well as the film , chronicled thirty years in the life of henry hill ( played by ray liotta ) , irish-italian criminal from new york . at the age of 13 he gets recruited in the criminal organisation of paulie cicero ( played by paul sorvino ) , local mob boss , and gradually climbs up the ladder starting with small errands . after couple of years , together with his best childhood friend tommy de vito ( played by joe pesci ) , he joins the crew of expert thieves led by jimmy conway ( played by robert de niro ) . three of them spend years as best friends and associates , gathering enormous wealth from their criminal enterprises that would culminate with one of the most spectacular robberies in american history . wealth , influence and privileges of men connected with mafia are enough for henry hill to seduce his future wife karen ( played by lorraine bracco ) , who would afterwards remain loyal to her husband despite infidelities , domestic abuse , arrests and would even be accomplice to his own private drug dealing business . but the perfect world of "" wiseguys "" gradually begins to fall apart - tommy's unpredictable outbursts of homicidal violence , jimmy's reluctance to share his part of the loot with partners and , finally , henry's own drug habit would lead to his downfall and make him question his loyalty to the friends . goodfellas is an excellent example of a film that represents work of a film genius in his full glory . scorsese managed to create a vision which is effective and complete despite being full of contradictions that would ripped the film apart in the hands of less talented filmmaker . world depicted in this film is both ordinary and fascinating . scorsese spares no effort to show us all the violence , hypocrisy and inherent paranoia of organised crime , yet it manages to make it both seductive and funny . after being exposed to two and half hours of the film and three decades of criminal history ( based on some notorious real life events ) , the audience understands why the characters chose such dangerous life paths , trading the superficial and short-lasting glamour and prosperity of a criminal to the dullness and poverty of honest citizens . scorsese also manages to break viewer's moralistic inhibitions by showing truly revolting material - scenes that depict personal tragedies , broken homes , human depravity , violence , bloodshed and murder - in all their uncompromising reality , but in a manner that would make it amusing and funny to the audience . with the use of ironic soundtrack , manipulative shots , character's dialogue or narrator's commentary , goodfellas represents the new standards of black humour that would became very popular few years later during tarantino era . even if we don't pay attention to skills with which potentially disturbing material becomes eye pleasing and entertaining , we should admit that scorsese displays his talents of truly original and creative filmmaker . first , we might notice unusual structure of the plot - relatively minor subplot is used as movie's ironic prologue . then , instead of single narrator , scorsese switches to the second character as narrator in the middle of the film only to switch back to the original shortly afterwards . this multiple points of views , both in terms of narration and various subjective shots , only lengthens the ironic distance towards characters and their situation . same ironic distance comes with extremely effective choice of soundtrack . nostalgia for good old times is illustrated with easy-listening 1950s pop songs , while depression , paranoia and bad times find their expression in more neurotic rock songs of late 1960s and 1970s . but the soundtrack is most effective when it is used as ironic comment - almost pastoral , easy listening tunes make strong and very ironic contrast to the scenes of violence and bloodshed . however , thing most associated with this film is couple of continuos shots that feature characters moving through large rooms and interacting with dozens if not hundreds of people . such scenes , although they require very great skill and patience during their shootings , became very popular among other directors in 1990s . fragmentary character of the screenplay , which doesn't have straight plot and instead bases film on series of loosely connected vignettes , gives another interesting opportunity for scorsese . he uses this structure of film to experiment , and most successful of such experiments is hilarious "" a day in life "" segment near the end of the film . another essential element of goodfellas is large but superb collection of great acting talents . the most respectable among them is robert de niro , but his character , who happen to be most quiet and business-like member of criminal trio , gets overshadowed by two of his friends and colleagues . joe pesci deserved his "" oscar "" for supporting role of homicidal psychopath tommy , and his lines , including ad-libs , probably represent the most memorable element of the film . ray liotta , although equally talented , perhaps doesn't look as the best choice for narrator and nominal hero of the film . liotta's henry hill looks somewhat too hollywoodised and glamorous among this bunch of low-level street thugs . liotta , on the other hand , improves general impression by very realistic and menacing portrayal of drug addiction . lorraine bracco is , on the other hand , very effective and believable as karen hill , wife who gradually descends into same moral cesspool as her husband . paul sorvino is also very effective as patriarch mafioso , and among the supporting cast most memorable is chuck low as pestering small-time gangster who unknowingly digs his own grave . as a combination of clever sociological study , black humour and innovative filmmaking goodfellas became something only the truly great films could do - work of art and excellent popular entertainment in the same time . because of this achievement , and also because of the great influence on future filmmakers , this cinematic gem deserves its rightful place among the best films of 1990s ."
""" the blair witch project "" was perhaps one of a kind , a unique film that played completely on its own merit , managing to scare even the most experienced horror fans out of their senses . its success made a sequel inevitable , but this is not the sequel , i suspect , anyone much wanted . after the release of "" the blair witch project "" , tourists have practically invaded the small town of burkettsville , in order to get a glimpse of the blair witch . locals have turned this mass hysteria into a great business opportunity , selling twig-sculptures , stones and dirt like those in the movie , and the exasperated local sheriff patrols the woods with a bullhorn , shouting , "" get out of these woods and go home ! there is no goddamned blair witch ! "" . jeff ( ) is one of those people , who has used the sudden popularity of the small town to his advantage . after he got released from the mental institution , he created a mobile business that attracts thousands of customers through the internet . as the movie starts he is leading one of these groups into the woods , on the "" blair witch hunt "" . among the five strangers is stephen and his girlfriend , the pregnant tristen , who are writing a book on the hysteria caused by the film called "" the blair witch : history or hysteria ? "" , and kim , who dresses in black and has some psychic powers . the last member of the crew is erica , a young beautiful witch-wannabe , who constantly quotes from the wiccan lore , saying "" the first rule of wicca is , do no harm , because whatever you do will come back to you threefold . "" this strange group plunges into the woods , where they begin to argue about their different approaches to the experience . on the very first night that they decide to spend under the stars amidst the ruins of parr's abandoned house , strange things start happening . when they wake up their equipment is gone and only the tapes remain . after a while they discover strange markings on their bodies . they are somehow lost in time , as it loops uncontrollably back and forth . they are all haunted by hallucinations and horrible nightmares and soon they can not see the difference between dreams and reality . the only thing that they are sure of is that they have brought something or someone with them from the woods . . documentary director joe berlinger ( "" paradice lost "" ) helms "" blair witch 2 "" , leaving the creators of the first film ( dan myrick and ed sanches ) in the background . the opening scenes--the documentary showing the townspeople affected by the first film-- is a more promising approach , because instead of trying to cover similar ground , it goes outside the first film and makes its own stand . but soon the movie gets confused and sidetracked by its own story , that is never resolved and ends with a very anticlimaxic epilogue . in a way , this is a typical hollywood sequel . more money has been spent and more people have worked on a project that was doomed to fail . the horror and suspense of the original simply could not be repeated . of course in these situations , quantity is more important than quality and profit is more important than the artistical values . from its opening scenes when the camera gracefully panes over the bloody-red forest , with carter burwell's ( "" being john malkovich "" and "" fargo "" ) musical score in the background , you realize that with the exception of its title , this film has absolutely nothing to do with "" the blair witch project "" . "" blair witch . . "" was filmed by handheld videocameras and nfeatured acting that was mostly based on improvisation . in the sequel the technical aspect of the film is close to perfection , creating a completely different atmosphere . with its graceful cinematography , production design and flashy editing , the film has a very polished look , which is impossible to associate with the first installment . and though berlinger directs his film with an energy and pace that makes the adrenaline rush through the body a couple of times , he has obviously misunderstood the nature of his predecessor . the key is simplicity .

"seen may 31 , 1999 on home video ( rented ) . one of the best things about the movies is that they can make you really start to wonder and analyze things in your own , everyday life that you might not have thought much of otherwise . with some films it might be just a secondary issue , but with `dark city' what we get is nearly an entire film committed to philosophizing and theorizing about human memory and how it defines who we are , which is a poignant theme made through an absolutely beautifully-constructed film with the kind of story and setting that could only happen in a movie . there's an old role-playing computer game called `d ? ja v ? ' wherein the player takes on the role of a man who can't remember who he is , where he is and how he got there . the goal is to gather as many clues as possible to figure that out and along the way overcome a conflict . the premise to this film is not unlike that game , only this time we don't have control over the protagonist . we begin by meeting a seemingly ordinary man living in an extremely dark and dirty city ( actually , it's more than just the city , it's the whole reality ) that isn't just that neo-gothic look ( a la `batman , ' `blade runner , ' ) , but is so fully developed it's almost a different genre completely . later he will learn that his name is john murdoch ( sewell ) , but for now he has no idea what's going on other than the fact something is not right . the fact there's a dead body in the corner goes to enhance the feeling of paranoia and a mysterious , hurried call telling him to leave immediately is also very chilling . this opening scene alone goes a long way to define the setting of the film and its bizarre , horrific tone . the man doesn't know who he is nor where he's going and it's interesting to follow him since we the viewers have no idea either we can sympathize and identify with him . in fact , this is the way all stories begin since it's impossible to know the history of a character , their feelings , values , morals , etc . until after we've observed them for a while . but in this case , the total feeling of amnesia is an excellent tool towards characterization , developing the mood and outlining the story . eventually , some semblance of a plot begins to unfold as it appears that john is a serial killer wanted by the police . we met inspector frank bumstead ( hurt ) , a quiet , unemotional , soft-spoken deadpan man who appears to have been on the trail of the killer for some time . two other important characters are also introduced : dr . daniel p . schreber ( sutherland ) , a neurotic psychiatrist who claims to be john's doctor ; and emma murdoch ( connelly ) , a jazz singer dolled up to look like a caraciture right out of the old dick tracy serials or any given leading lady of the old film-noir movies . it was schreber who contacted john for reasons that are continually revealed throughout the course of the film . he also contacts emma , which further helps the film reveal what is seemingly a complex , mysterious back story . but absolutely nothing is as it appears to be in `dark city , ' which is what makes it so fascinating throughout its continual scenes of confusion and vertigo . everything the filmmakers want us to see has some significance - considering how intricate the detail is to every single shot , its lighting , art direction and overall production design , they don't seem to be able to afford any gratuities . however , that might also be what's keeping it from reaching its maximum potential . by continuing to follow john as he wanders around this strange place , so much unlike the real world we know , we come to realize that it's all a hoax . everyone in the city is the subject of an experiment being conducted by a race of aliens to understand what makes humans tick in their efforts to somehow save themselves from extinction . but , as the film's tagline says , `last night , one of us went off . ' for reasons that are never clearly explained , it appears that john possesses telekinetic powers to can do pretty much whatever his mind can conceive ( a process known as `tuning' ) . the aliens , which look like very old bald human men with pasty skin , also possess the power en masse and use it to change the city every night at midnight . at the same time all the humans fall asleep and after the changes are made , they awake and either continue where they left off or begin a new life they have no idea they did not have until then . this premise certainly is interesting and director and co-screenwriter alex proyas is able to keep the film consistently mysterious in this regard . he does provide some explanations such as that dr . schreber is an assistant to `the strangers' because he somehow could synthesize memory into chemical form . the aliens mix and match the memories of the city's population to see who will change and who will not . in the process this creates for a good deal of deep , thought-provoking philosophies that could be applied to the real world . however , where the film errs is by not playing up the idea of memory versus the human heart as to what makes a person who he or she is . the main characters are all closely intertwined within the seemingly complex murder mystery which never actually happened , yet when they start to go through some of the expected emotions it comes off as distant , static and cold ( mediocre performances by hurt and connelly don't help either ) . for example , john realizes emma is not and probably never was his wife so he does not feel an emotional bond to her , yet in some scenes crucial to the film's plot , we are expected to believe they do have a genuine love for each other , which is also part of the film's climax and ending . and that's what proyas seems to be inferring with the film , but never quite manages to convey in its fullest sense . ironically , this is what made his first film `the crow' work so well , which had a similar theme of struggling to find hope and the human spirit within a nearly identical , dark twisted world . with `dark city' the messenger seems to be mistaken for the message . still , the film is by no means bad and is consistently entertaining and enjoyable . there's a lot to like here , most notably the sheer visual look and style of it all which accounts for at least half the reasons the film is able to tell the story it does . the story as a whole is one of the most original to come out of hollywood in years . `dark city' is what the movies are all about - the escape from the real world ."

Related Gallery 2014 Toyota 4Runner New 2014 4Runner Features Rugged Exterior Design To Match Its Authentic Off-Road Heritage -Added Interior Refinement; Two- or three-row versatility -Body-On-Frame Off-Road Performance -Advanced audio and connectivity features TORRANCE, Calif., April 27, 2013 /PRNewswire/ -- For nearly three decades, the Toyota 4Runner mid-size SUV has been a stalwart for off-roading enthusiasts seeking a SUV with rugged, go-anywhere capability. Currently in its fifth-generation, 4Runner continues as one of the few fully capable mid-size SUVs, and the redesigned 2014 4Runner receives a rugged new exterior design, and interior refinements that add comfort and convenience without sacrificing its hallmark performance capability and excellent value. The 4Runner combines rugged body-on-frame construction with comprehensive suspension technology that yields optimal off-road capability with a smooth ride and comfort more often associated with crossovers. The 2014 4Runner is available in three grades: a well-equipped, value-driven SR5; top-of-the-line Limited, and a Trail grade for those who want maximum off-road capability. Optional third-row seats on SR5 and Limited allow for up to seven-person capacity. 4Runner owners will have the choice of a rear wheel 4x2, part-time 4x4 or a full-time multi-mode 4x4 with a locking center differential. All models are equipped with a powerful 4.0-liter, 270-horsepower V6 teamed to a five-speed ECT-i automatic transmission and one of the few vehicles that continues to offer a transfer case. 4Runner's Rugged Exterior Design Projects Its Off-Road Heritage With a Premium Refinement The refreshed 4Runner features a redesigned front fascia that conveys a more rugged and aggressive appearance. This includes a muscular front grille, and edgier smoked headlamps for a more forceful look. The SR5 and Trail grades feature a color-keyed grille insert and front bumper that is surrounded by fog lamps set in sharply cut inlays that extend from the headlamps down to the bumper. The Trail grade features new color-keyed bumpers and overfenders, and it continues to be distinguished by an aggressive hood scoop and silver painted front and rear bumper accents. All grades are now standard with a roof rack. In addition to the distinctive new grille, the premium Limited's front design stands apart with a chrome-plated grille insert and chrome front bumper that extends to the fog-lamp bezels. The side molding, roof rack and rear bumper are also chrome trimmed. The headlamps have also changed from halogen to projector beam, with both the headlamps and redesigned rear combination lamps on all 4Runner grades now featuring LED lamps. Both the SR5 and Trail grades will ride on 17-inch alloy wheels with a new wheel-design for both, while the Limited continues to ride on 20-inch alloy wheels, which are now painted black prior to machining to add contrast. All grades continue to come standard with a full-size spare. The 2014 4Runner will be available in eight exterior colors that include new additions: Super White; Attitude Black Metallic; Barcelona Red Metallic; and Nautical Blue Metallic. They will join carryover colors that include: Blizzard Pearl; Classic Silver Metallic; Magnetic Gray Metallic; and Black. New Interior Styling Has a refined style with the Comfort expected of a Mid-size SUV The 4Runner exterior updates are complemented by touches of refinement on the inside. Both the SR5 and Trail grade add standard Soft Touch door trim, and a leather-wrapped steering wheel and leather shift knob provide a premium feel and atmosphere. The SR5 receives a new bright and highly visible Optitron instrument panel that houses speedometer, tachometer, voltage, fuel and coolant temperature gauges, plus a multi-information display that offers multiple functions. An Eco-Driving feedback system allows the driver to monitor fuel consumption in real time. On 4Runner Trail, an overhead console within easy reach organizes the off-road control switches into one location. A compass indicator and outside temperature display add functionality. A manually controlled air conditioning system is standard on SR5 and Trail grades; the Limited features an automatic dual-zone climate-control system. For second-row passengers, a sculpted front seat-back shape provides additional knee space. The second-row seats, which include a center armrest, individually recline up to 16 degrees in four steps for relaxing passenger comfort. The 40/20/40 second-row seat configuration also has a one-touch walk-in function, making access to the third row easier. Third-row seating is available on SR5 and Limited grades and features a roomy, supportive seating area. The SR5 and Trail grade come standard with comfortable fabric-trimmed seating available in Sand Beige, Graphite or Black. Available SofTex seats offer a soft, rich feel. New for 2014, the SR5 adds a standard eight-way power driver seat. The Limited comes standard with a leather-trimmed interior with new ventilated driver and front passenger seats in Sand Beige, Black and a new Redwood color. Front seats are also heated with eight-way power-adjustable driver's seat with power lumbar support and four-way power-adjustable passenger seat. Both front seats are now standard with memory settings. Powerful 4.0-liter V6 Helps Take 4Runner Anyplace, Anytime The 4Runner 4.0-liter V6 generates 270 horsepower and 278 lb.-ft. of torque. Dual independent Variable Valve Timing with intelligence (VVT-i) optimizes torque across the engine's operating range. Fuel economy ratings rival some crossover SUVs with an EPA-estimated 17 mpg city and 23 mpg highway for 4x2 models, and 17 mpg city and 22 mpg highway for 4x4. Maximum towing capacity is 5,000 pounds and all vehicles feature an integrated tow-hitch receiver and wiring harness as standard equipment. 4Runner Balances Full Off-Road Capability with Smooth Around-town Handling A double-wishbone independent front suspension, combined with a variable-flow rack-and-pinion steering, help give the 4Runner precise control on demanding roads. Coil springs over gas shocks are used at all four wheels for a comfortable ride and controlled handling. The four-link rear suspension maximizes off-road axle articulation, whileproviding a smooth ride for rear-seat passengers on and off pavement. The Limited grade comes standard with an X-REAS suspension system that further improves performance, comfort and control. With X-REAS, 4Runner corners flatter, smoother, and handles choppy pavement more easily. X-REAS automatically adjusts the damping force of shocks when driving over bumpy surfaces or when cornering. The system uses a center control absorber to cross-link shocks on opposite corners of the vehicle, substantially reducing pitch and yaw by offsetting opposing inputs. The 4Runner SR5 and Trail 4x4 models have a two-speed, part-time four-wheel-drive system with neutral position, maximizing fuel efficiency when a 4x4 configuration isn't needed. The 4Runner Limited is equipped with a full-time, four-wheel-drive system with a locking center differential and a three-mode, center console-mounted switch. The A-TRAC traction control system is standard equipment on all 4x4 models. The system can distribute driving force to any one wheel in contact with the ground, making terrain irregularities and slippery patches virtually transparent to the driver. An electronic-locking rear differential is standard on the Trail grade. The Trail grade is designed to maximize off-road performance with superior approach and departure angles, high ground clearance, and an array of functional upgrades for the most demanding active outdoor enthusiast. The Trail grade offers an optional Kinetic Dynamic Suspension System (KDSS). KDSS significantly improves terrain-following ability by dynamically disconnecting stabilizer bars to allow for more axle travel, and better suspension articulation in slow, difficult terrain. Toyota's Crawl Control (CRAWL) feature is standard on the Trail grade. The system helps maintain an appropriate speed to keep the vehicle under control and minimizes the load on drivetrain and suspension components. With the transfer case shifted into low range, CRAWL regulates engine speed and output (along with braking force), to propel the vehicle forward or in reverse at one of the five driver-selectable low-speed settings. This allows the driver to maintain focus on steering over rough level ground or steep grades without having to also modulate the throttle or brake pedal. The Trail grade also features a Multi-Terrain Select system that dials in wheel-slip control to match the terrain. In loose terrain such as mud and sand, more-than-normal wheel slip is permitted, allowing wheel-spin to work in the vehicle's favor. On bumpy moguls, or solid rock, wheel slip is minimized and the system acts more like a limited slip differential. The Mogul setting is for any extremely uneven terrain, such as V-ditches, slopes, and ridges, uphill or down. All models come standard with Hill-start Assist Control (HAC), which provides additional control for off-road driving by helping to hold the vehicle stationary before starting on a steep incline or slippery surface. All 4Runner 4x4 models feature standard Downhill Assist Control (DAC). This feature augments the low-speed ascending ability of low-range by helping to hold the vehicle, allowing time for the driver to a target speed with no driver intervention. Versatility and Convenience Provide Comfort and Utility An array of convenience features and versatile seating configurations provide the 2014 4Runner with ample passenger comfort and utility. Fold-flat second-row seats provide a level load floor in the 4Runner, and it is not necessary to remove the headrests to fold the seats flat. The available third-row seat is split 50/50 and folds flat. The seats can be folded from the side or at the rear, using separate one-touch levers. With this arrangement, more cargo space is available without removing seats, and longer items can be conveniently carried. A Smart Key system featuring keyless entry with push-button start is standard on the Limited grade. The system allows the driver to unlock or start the vehicle by carrying the keyless remote. The cargo door window has jam control, like the moonroof and power side windows. An available pull-out cargo deck is capable of carrying up to 440 pounds to make loading and unloading heavy items easier and to provide seating for tailgating and campsite relaxation. All 4Runner models come standard with a 120V outlet and two additional 12V outlets. A front and rear clearance sonar system is standard on Limited models, and a rear-view backup camera is now standard on all 4Runner models. The system displays in the audio screen, increasing visibility at the rear of the vehicle. New Audio Systems Include Standard Entune™ Multimedia System New for 2014 on SR5 and Trail grade 4Runner models is Entune™ Audio Plus, which includes Toyota's Entune multimedia system, an AM/FM/MP3 CD player with eight speakers, integrated SiriusXM™ Satellite Radio (includes 90-day trial subscription), USB port with iPod connectivity, and Bluetooth® hands-free phone capability and music streaming. Standard on the Limited grade is the new Entune Premium JBL Audio system, which incorporates today's most in-demand connectivity features. It includes the Entune multimedia system, a JBL® premium sound system with navigation, SiriusXM Satellite Radio (with a 90-day trial subscription), HD Radio with iTunes® tagging and 15 speakers. The navigation system includes a large seven-inch monitor. Entune is a collection of popular mobile applications and data services, with three years of complimentary access. Once a smart phone is connected to the vehicle using Bluetooth wireless technology or a USB cable, Entune's features are operated using the vehicle's controls or, for some services, by voice recognition. Entune offers mobile apps for Bing™, iHeartRadio, MovieTickets.com, OpenTable®, and Pandora®. Entune data services include a fuel price guide, sports scores, stocks, traffic and weather. Standard on all audio systems is a unique ""party mode"" audio setting that is ideal for tailgating, raises bass response and shifts sound balance to the rear of the vehicle. Party mode is in addition bolstered by rear liftgate-mounted speakers, which function with or without party mode selected. The pole antenna has been dropped in favor of a new in-glass antenna. Toyota's Exclusive Star Safety System, Eight Standard Airbags, Safety Connect The 4Runner features Toyota's standard Star Safety System™ that includes Vehicle Stability Control (VSC) with traction control (TRAC), an Anti-lock Brake System (ABS) with Electronic Brake-force Distribution (EBD), Brake Assist (BA), and Smart Stop Technology (SST) brake-override system. VSC helps the driver to ensure control by compensating for front and rear wheel slip. The system uses selective braking and modulated engine output to help keep the vehicle in line with the driver's steering inputs. On 4x2 vehicles, the Auto LSD (Limited Slip Differential) system allows for better traction on slippery sections of roadway. The four-wheel ABS with EBD provides the 4Runner with optimal brake proportioning, regardless of vehicle load. Eight standard airbags includes front, side-mounted and knee airbags for the driver and front passenger, and side-curtain airbags for the second and third rows. All 2014 4Runners have active headrests for driver and passenger, and three-point seat belts for all seats. The 2014 4Runner Limited offers the Safety Connect™ telematics system. Available by subscription, with or without the optional navigation system, Safety Connect offers four safety and security features: Automatic Collision Notification, Stolen Vehicle Location, Emergency Assistance Button (SOS), and Roadside Assistance. When Safety Connect is ordered, it includes a one-year trial subscription. In case of either airbag deployment or severe rear-end collision, an Automatic Collision Notification system is designed to automatically call a dedicated response center. If a response agent cannot communicate with the occupants, the agent can contact the nearest emergency-services provider to dispatch assistance. Pushing the in-vehicle ""SOS"" button allows drivers to reach the response center to request help in an emergency as well as for a wide range of roadside assistance needs. If a 4Runner equipped with Safety Connect is stolen, agents can work with local authorities to help locate and recover the vehicle. 4Runner Includes Toyota Care Complimentary Maintenance Toyota's 36-month/36,000 mile basic new-vehicle warranty applies to all components other than normal wear and maintenance items. Additional 60-month warranties cover powertrain for 60,000 miles and corrosion with no mileage limitation. The 4Runner will also come standard with Toyota Careä, a complimentary plan covering normal factory-scheduled maintenance and 24-hour roadside assistance for two years or 25,000 miles, whichever comes first.

I hate those clear taillights, looks very cheap. 34 minutes ago Report abuse Permalink Okay folks, now I know that this 4runner is freeking out there with its looks, but ya gotta give it to Toyota for one thing...their CEO put out that mandate last year to stop putting out sedate and boring vehicles, and that dude is definately keeping his word...look at the new Avalon and the FR-S...he is definitely putting out product, like it or not, that everyone is talking about in some form or fashion... 43 minutes ago Report abuse Permalink The 4Runner has simply been an unattractive car for sometime now. I appreciate that they are sticking with a true BOF SUV when others (Ford, Nissan) have abandoned the concept. Industry trends are stacked against this car. Toyota probably doesn't mind because it has the Highlander and RAV4 on the CUV side. But I can't help but think that the 4Runner would sell in better numbers if it wasn't so ugly. And a 4Runner from 20 years ago still looks so good. 1 hour ago Report abuse Permalink Spartan is what this vehicle is, but does it also have to be ugly? wtf were they thinking. 2 hours ago Report abuse Permalink With a little bit of work, this could look 100% better. It's clear it's just a quick refresh of the old model, so they went cheap. Probably a good strategy considering it's not a high volume vehicle. The mixture of curving sheet metal A pillar/windscreen, along with the B pillar front into the roof and the sharp pillars at the C pillar don't mesh. They should all be sharp. Secondly, go with conservative tail-lights. Off-roaders break tail-lights and don't want to be paying a metric ton to replace them. Obviously, the entire front end needs a re-design, and lose the hood scoop. The approach angle in glorious on this beast. 2 hours ago Report abuse Permalink Toyota is at it Again with their Conservative and very Non Competiive design staff. THis is an EPIC fail on 4Runner redesign. To not do anything with the powertrain is a total Joke. Still going with a 5 Speed ... No Way!!! I guess they think so many uninformed auto buyers will just line up to buy a 4Runner. Really ... I think they are going to pay the price at Sales Loses into the 2014 model year against just about everyone else. THis is sort fo the same story with their Tundra and Tacoma ... No real improvements for powertrains and they think their sales will not be effected? THey are smoking some kind of weed over in the TOYOTA Headquarters. 3 hours ago Report abuse Permalink 1 reply to Paul's comment uh what? Conservative? I think not homie.

I think it was the RSC. It was a two door and more curvaceous but a lot of styling cues seemed to be transplanted here.

"linda fiorentino disappeared off the radar after a deservedly heralded turn in the cable pic the last seduction , and her being cast as dogma's lead is nothing short of inexplicable . she's still in fine form as bethany , an abortion clinic worker who's lost her faith . one night , a visitor from heaven makes a fiery entrance in bethany's bedroom . he is metatron ( alan rickman ) , the voice of god , and he needs her help : she must stop two fallen angels from entering a new jersey church-the fate of the universe depends on it . god would do it him/herself , but he/she is . . . missing , having taken up human form somewhere on earth never to be heard from again . bethany is joined on her road trip to the garden state by the "" prophets "" jay ( jason mewes ) and silent bob ( kevin smith , doing double-duty ) , the slacker minstrels who have appeared in all of smith's films thus far . at some point , rock drops naked out of the sky as rufus , the undocumented ( and very black ) "" thirteenth apostle "" , and offers his assistance , as does divine stripper serendipity ( salma hayek ) . it's a wild ride . they're in pursuit of loki and bartleby ( damon and affleck , respectively-this is probably the sharpest either has ever been ) , who were banished from heaven to wisconsin and have discovered a dogmatic loophole that will enable their return . loki decides to wreak havoc along the way with the knowledge that his sins will be absolved at the pearly gates . at one point , he terrorizes a boardroom full of suits with an angry combination of words and bullets . it's a nasty , guiltily enjoyable little scene that asks , "" how corrupt are you ? "" . wings of desire this ain't . since debuting with clerks , smith has grown as a director , particularly in terms of working with actors . ( chris rock is this film's only weak link-between jokes , he's wooden . ) his no-frills visual style hasn't changed much over the years , though ( dogma's widescreen compositions at least have blockbuster affectations ) , nor has his writing-his characters still sit around delivering one caustic , hilarious speech after another . dogma chips away at big religious issues-namely , the hypocrisy that accompanies any organized system of beliefs-eloquently and articulately , but a few of the monologues sound too much like blatant exposition . as well , the verbal introduction of each new person seems to take forever . any movie with this much weighty talk would have a hard time maintaining momentum ( hurlyburly , anyone ? ) , and eventually dogma's pacing goes slack . a long diatribe from bartleby late in the game , in which he laments the destiny of celestial beings , comes at a point when we've heard enough . because his change of heart ( bartleby is initially the good cop to loki's bad ) drives the climax , said rant is given a great deal of screen time . sure , affleck deserved a big moment ( damon steals their scenes together prior ) , but it ultimately makes the film and us feel bloated . like tarantino , smith was a video-age sponge who became a sample-mad indie filmmaker . dogma pays welcome homage to an eclectic batch of movies , including indiana jones and the last crusade , with silent bob doing his best harrison ford , and weird science-a shit demon attacks our heroes ! smith also has a kitchen sink brand of humour : his dexterous maneuvering between the satirical ( a cardinal played by george carlin attempts to mount a publicity campaign with the slogan "" catholicism wow ! "" ) and the scatalogical ensures that no lover of comedy will leave dogma feeling malnourished . i bust ( ed ? ) a gut on several occasions . proceedings also get off on the right foot with the opening with the funniest disclaimer ever . it's a disclaimer unlikely to put protestors at ease , for to read it , one actually has to see dogma . the prerelease ballyhoo is in the tradition of the last temptation of christ's , martin scorsese's 1988 adaptation of nikos kazantzakis' controversial novel , in that it is not directly linked to the picture's content but to rumours and heresy . there's a famous anecdote about fletch director michael ritchie inviting picketers of the last temptation of christ into a screening on his dime , just so they could know for certain what they were rallying against . ( not one of them had watched it . ) every single person refused . smith and scorsese have a lot in common , and so do the two films in question , because both smith's bethany and scorsese's jesus are hollow shells without their faith . in fact , dogma's denouement ( which follows a thrilling showdown that's worth the wait ) is a catholic love-in , a veritable recruitment poster . ( i felt sentimental about a religion i don't belong to . now that's powerful filmmaking . ) smith is nothing if not sincere about his own devotion to god , and that spirituality shines through . it's enough to make me forgive dogma for its editorial sins . my religion is movies . when the catholic league beats on dogma for imaginary crimes against a doctrine , in a roundabout way they're attacking what i live for : freedom of expression through celluloid . i therefore feel that , although i'm no bible-thumper , i'm at least as qualified to criticize dogma as william donohue and his followers ."
"you've heard all the hype . you've seen all their faces - natalie portman ( the professional ) as queen amidala , liam neeson ( schindler's list ) as qui-gon jinn , ewan mcgregor ( trainspotting ) as obi-wan kenobi , and jake lloyd ( jingle all the way ) as young anakin skywalker . if you've read any reviews , you've also probably heard that this movie fails to live up to the magic and humanity of the first trilogy . you also may have heard that this one's too kiddie-friendly , and doesn't have enough content for adults . believe the hype . the effects are stunning , the digitalized creatures are amazingly realistic , the lightsaber duels are amazing , and queen amidala's sumptuous robes are fit to be worn by queen elizabeth . but there's something missing here , and it isn't budget or effects - it's everything money * can't * buy . the actors struggle as best they can to flesh out broad-stroked and flat characters . the most successful at this is liam neeson who , as qui-gon jinn , a jedi master to young obi-wan kenobi , has quiet dignity and a wise , commanding presence . he is the anchor to this movie , as he is the one character who george lucas apparently spent some time fleshing out . portman's queen amidala and mcgregor's obi-wan kenobi don't fare nearly so well . amidala , the future mother of luke and leia and the queen of a peaceful planet being invaded by the trade federation ( ? ! ? ) , comes off as stoic , stilted and caricatured ( it appears as though she was a vulcan geisha in a former life ) . and obi-wan , although mcgregor makes him very endearing , has so little screen time that he's nothing but a robin to qui-gon jinn's batman . however , mcgregor does struggle manfully to infuse this surprisingly small supporting role with a spark of genuine insight and humanity , and he does a good job . he also absolutely nails alec guiness' ( obi-wan in episode 4 - 6 ) scottish accent , and that really makes his presence in the film more profound than it might have been otherwise . in fact , lucas seems to bank on that preexisting knowledge quite a bit , and that's one of the problems with this film . i would never call myself a "" star wars "" fan - especially not considering what it means to be a fanatic these days - but i've always enjoyed the films along with everyone else in america . however , if you are the one person in america who * hasn't * seen the films at all or even recently , or who doesn't bother to brush-up on the names of obscure characters , you may be hopelessly lost . for example , one of the film's main ( nefarious ) characters is senator palpatine . for those of you not recently steeped in "" star wars "" trivia , emperor palpatine is that scary hooded apparition who was darth vader's master in "" return of the jedi "" and "" empire strikes back . "" so , obviously , his appearance in "" phantom menace "" is meant to stir some echoes of his later role in the series , thus making his role here more meaningful . a lot of the movie is like that . r2-d2 and c-3po make token appearances , and it's obvious that lucas is banking on the audience's pre-existing fondness for them . . . because he doesn't do much to add to it in any way . same goes for jabba the hutt , who doesn't look as much mean here as he does corpulent and lazy . even * planets * make foreshadowing guest appearances in this film - tatooine ( the desert world where luke grew up ) , coruscant ( the cloud city from "" empire strikes back "" ) , and alderaan ( leia's home planet - which we never actually see - that gets blown up in "" star wars "" ) show up or are mentioned briefly in passing . what's the result of tying so many plot points and characters to future films ? the answer is that this one seems surprisingly empty . there's no meat - no substance - that makes you want to love the characters as they are , not as they will be . another problem is that there are actually * too many * alien characters in the film . i was distracted by the fact that two of the main evil characters - strange looking aliens who looked like gila monsters - had mouths that barely moved , making them look more like muppets than actual characters . and jar jar binks , a silly roger rabbitish amphibious character , is intended as comic relief , but what he really becomes is annoying - and fast . unlike chewbacca and c-3po , who got their humanity ( if you'll pardon the expression ) from their interactions with the human characters , jar jar is often left to interact mostly with others of his kind , at times making the movie seem like nothing more than a very expensive "" teenage mutant ninja turtles . "" furthermore , the dialogue is often stilted and corny , and sometimes downright infantile , thereby rendering some characters into nothing more than bystanders to the plot . oddly , this isn't just * my * judgment - lucas has said that he designed this film for kids . well , he's done a good job . the hero of this film , of course , is young anakin , but it was very hard for me to feel any kinship or identify with an eight-year-old boy . that's not jake lloyd's fault , though - he does a good job of being a cute kid , which is apparently all lucas asked of him . that's another mistake , of course , because the cute tyke becomes darth vader . warning : spoilers ahead ! ! ! ! in my opinion , there was not nearly enough foreshadowing of anakin's future evil in the film . the boy is all blond flowing hair and rosy cheeks , and there's nothing more than a spark of aggression in him throughout the entire movie . he has a doting mother ( pernilla august , making her first english- language film ) and is a slave to a gross flying gnome on tatooine . but the only indication the audience gets that this kid isn't all hearts and roses is yoda's hesitation in allowing him to train as a jedi under qui-gon jinn . his explanation ? "" his future is clouded . "" ( warning : major spoiler ahead . enter at your own risk . ) of course , the noble qui-gon dies at the hand of darth maul , a scary-looking sith lord who excels at the jedi arts , but has turned to the dark side . this dude has maybe two lines in the entire movie , but he establishes his presence through his amazing moves with his double-sided lightsaber , and his scary facial makeup . because qui-gon never gets a chance to train the young anakin in the ways of the force , obi-wan , qui-gon's young padawan apprentice ( one level below knightdom ) , must take over the training himself . so , at the end of the movie , we end where the saga actually begins - with obi-wan kenobi and his young apprentice , anakin "" darth vader "" skywalker . did this story need to be told ? i would say no . but is it a worthwhile movie to see ? absolutely . if you don't enter the theater with jedi-size expectations , and you simply want to be treated to an enjoyable visual spectacle , then this is your movie . the tatooine pod races are a triumph of effects and computer animation . the digitalized backgrounds on some of the planets are an astonishing sight . and yoda and young obi-wan are worth seeing for their origins in a simpler , happier time . above all , this is a fun movie . not deep , not meaningful , and not profound . but fun . maybe next time , lucas will hire lawrence kasdan to co-write the script , and the guy who directed "" empire "" will direct . because if lucas does the next one himself , it will be lacking the one thing it needs the most - potential . : )"
"as african american detective vergil tibbs questions a suspected white murderer inside a jail cell , there is a wonderful , eye-catching shot which instantaneously presents the main message of the entire film . the shot has tibbs' face completely covered by the shadows of the prison bars . to see these bars blocking his face , we see how separated tibbs is from the rest of the characters in the film . as a black detective conducting an investigation in a southern town full of violent white bigots , no matter how innocent tibbs is , he is still seen by these bigots as a threat simply because of the color of his skin . the bars show that tibbs has not been given a fair chance to show exactly who he is , instead others have chosen him as different and dangerous . this one shot amazes me because it captures a whole theme in a matter of seconds . it perhaps may be the most powerful image i have seen in a film . "" in the heat of the night "" was the first and the best of the three films norman jewison directed concerning racism in america . jewison has a very keen style of displaying various cases of racism as he is neither pedantic nor overly sentimental . in these three films he does an excellent job creating very detailed equal analyses of characters from the abused to the abusers . he is also not afraid to tell the absolute truth about how corrupt society was in the past and is in the present . preceding the very original "" a soldier's story "" and the recently released "" the hurricane , "" "" in the heat of the night contains some classic lines and some very memorable characters . the film , which won best picture in 1967 focuses on vergil tibbs , played superbly by sidney poitier as a fearless african american police officer from philadelphia who refuses to give up on an investigation in a white town where is he not wanted . tibbs is a man who rarely loses his temper and that is worth mentioning because he is constantly facing abuse from those around him . as a hero who is not afraid to face off against five men with chains , tibbs is the perfect protagonist . poitier also gives an excellent , noteworthy voice to his character . never nervous and always commanding , his speech patterns are very manipulative as they range from stentorian to soothing . however , unlike "" the hurricane "" where denzel washington dominated over the rest of the cast , poitier shares the spotlight with rod steiger , who won best actor for his excellent performance . as a sheriff who helps tibbs and warns him of the dangers around him , steiger shows a great amount of skill in his role . he starts off as racist and blind as the other townspeople . he would refer to tibbs as "" boy "" and would always suspiciously keep an eye on him . as the film progresses though , there is a very gradual change in the sheriff . he begins to see the hardships tibbs faces and he sees the foolishness of his own neighbors . what i really enjoyed about steiger's character was that he did not completely abandon his friends or connect with tibbs at the end of the film . he still could not refer to tibbs as mister tibbs or officer tibbs but rather settled for virgil . instead , it was apparent that he was eventually going to see the world differently in the future . most movies would have a character reversing all of his beliefs and influences in a matter of minutes . this action would not have been realistic at all since it is nearly impossible for someone to believe something one day and believe something else the next day . jewison's determination to make this film as realistic as possible is very obvious here and also very appropriate . "" in the heat of the night "" shows the difference between the north and the south or a major city and a small town in the united states during the 1960's . it displays this perfectly . however , the actual investigation , although it is not the main focus of the film , lacks interest . it seemed rushed especially towards the end as if jewison had given his message about racism and did not feel like giving a credible explanation involving the murder victim . there were way too many characters added during the last fifteen minutes and some of the scenes during this time period were inane ( police officer sam being a suspect was not needed ) . also , it is given that tibbs is a vigilant homicide detective who is the best at what he does , but some of his discoveries came out of nowhere and how he found out some of the important case details towards the end were never answered . the rushed ending was the only mistake of this otherwise memorable jewison classic . ( a congratulations has to be given to actor scott wilson . he managed to be in the two best movies of 1967 , "" in the heat of the night "" and the even better "" in cold blood . "" )"
"in wonder boys michael douglas plays an aged writer \ professor with such lived-in naturalism that i believe it may be his best performance . ever since wall street , douglas has spent the greater part of his career playing variations on the shark in a suit gordon gecko character he personified in the mid-80's . in those performances he tended to exaggerate the vehemence of cutthroat businessmen , with much frothing at the mouth while projecting all his bad intentions to the world . you'd think such a man would keep his evil wrapped tightly underneath a good-natured veneer , but from gordon gecko to nicholas van orton , douglas played the role straight and out in the open . in wonder boys his performance isn't showy or a tour de force , it's simple yet truthful . he embodies grady , a craggy old writer with a predilection for pot and pink bathrobes . grady instructs a writers workshop while working tirelessly on a follow up to the novel that put him on the map . when we first encounter this curmudgeon in the midst of his workshop , we hear his sardonic narration on the soundtrack as students bombard one of their own with unfair criticisms . grady points out , in his narration , that they only do so out of jealousy . their target is the very writerly named james leer ( played by the always understated tobey maguire ) , a student full of potential and one whom grady develops a mild affection for . leer is the kind of youth who seems to mechanically block out emotions . he speaks in an intellectualized monotone with just a hint of dry wit around the edges . he's portentous and gloomy , as if modeling himself after the great depressed writers , though his act is a little too calculated . he reminds me of the self-imposed outcast film director , jim jarmusch ( dead man , ghost dog ) . whenever i happen to catch jarmusch in an interview i see the man speaking in a toneless manner ( the monotonous drawl supposedly masking depth or contempt for his interviewer ) , exclusively dressed in black , and with his spiked hair dyed snow white . leer is similar , a guy who equates quirks with depth . tobey maguire fits well in the role . with his round , sweet-eerie face he resembles bud cort from harold and maude . but unlike cort , maguire is easier to warm up to ; he's a messed up kid reaching for artistic credibility . katie holmes plays hannah , a beautiful , talented writing student just itching to get in grady's pants . this is a plot line i had trouble with . douglas , in his old age , is beginning to resemble jerry springer , a man who has actually paid for sex on numerous documented occasions . at first i found it extremely difficult to believe that someone as beautiful as hannah would desire grady ( maybe it's because i'm jealous , and wish holmes was throwing herself at me , after all i may just be a lowly internet critic but at least i still have all my teeth ) , then i think of douglas's real life companion , the breathtaking catherine zeta jones . seeing those two together looks a lot like a kidnapping . suddenly my mind has shifted from the task at hand ( that being reviewing this completely wonderful movie ) and i'm pontificating on why the hell jones would desire douglas . there is a movie in there somewhere . grady , rather chivalrously if you ask me , resists the charms of hannah for sara gaskell ( a droll frances mcdormand ) , who is his age , but also married to another professor . okay , maybe not so chivalrous . there is a great line in the film spoken by douglas about sara where he says , "" she was a junkie for the printed word . lucky for me i manufactured her drug of choice "" . robert downy j . r plays a bisexual editor who makes his entrance with a towering transvestite on his arm . downy has mastered the gleefully dry hyper articulate wit of many a hipster intellectual . he's arrogant but completely likeable in his utter arrogance . the actor is perfectly cast here , and remains a joyous movie presence somewhere between a typical tom hanksian comic leading man and edgy character actor . i wish wonder boys had more of him . searching for a plot among the elements of wonder boys would be pointless , for it meanders through its running time , but that's part of its charm . and maybe i'm a bit biased towards the film because it takes place in a haven of literary academia , a place i'm greatly fond of , and a place rarely explored in american cinema . everyone has a sub-genre ( be it war films , westerns , dance movies ) that they happen to be privy to . i'm privy to films about literary types i . e . those individuals enthralled by the written word , and if you are not so inclined it may be wise to knock my above grade down about half a notch . the direction by curtis hanson is more akin to a european film with its leisurely pace and situations that grow from the characters , rather than generic mapped out story points . sometimes the dialogue is too clever , but that's a problem i wish i found with films more often . another minor quibble is that early on the film seems a bit too introverted , like its characters , but as the story progresses it begins to open up . for me wonder boys works as subtle drama because of its insight into artistic types , and as a low-key comedy for its chuckle-worthy throwaway gags . the gags are like those in the great robert altman ( m * a * s * h , the long goodbye ) movies , where jokes exist as asides on the fringes , like jokes in life often do . the broader comedy such as the killing of a blind dog , and incessant smoking of marijuana isn't ineffective but not nearly as memorable as the little things . curtis hanson , who before his last film , la confidential , toiled about with exploitation fare like losin' it ( an early tom cruise sex comedy ) and the hand the rocks the cradle , has graduated to more meaningful films . he directs wonder boys in an appropriately dour style , the comedy coming from the false gloom his characters put up . the morose crooning of leonard cohen would seem an odd song for the background of any party , but in a wonder boys party , it fits . the film is like a piece of literature put up on the big screen . it's the cinematic equivalent to a good read , novelistic in its approach with themes rarely found in american movies . many will find it slight , but i found much to savor among its subtleties ."
"plot : derek zoolander is a male model . he is also very dumb and impressionable . for that reason , he is secretly hired and trained ( so secret , that even he doesn't know about it ) by an underground fashion syndicate to assassinate the prime minister of malaysia , who wants to abolish child labor in his country . will zoolander fulfill the dirty deed ? will zoolander ever grace the world his new "" look "" ? is this a funny movie ? find out below . . . critique : there's a place in our world for "" stupid comedies "" . films which don't pretend to take themselves seriously , are based on idiotic premises and filled with dumb jokes . there's also a time for them and many would argue that this difficult period of our history , might be an ideal circumstance during which to "" relax "" by watching something so completely frivolous . well , if you're in the mood for some seriously mindless entertainment , ben stiller and his cast of many have assembled one of the more original dumb comedies in some time . of course , comedies as such are usually very subjective and i could see how some will see this film simply as stupid and unfunny , while others will grant them the "" stupid "" , but consider it funny instead . i personally enjoyed it for the most part , cracked up loudly during a couple of specific sequences and loved the derek zoolander character and the unrestrained whipping they released upon the fashion industry . snap ! it was also nice to see several real-life models with small roles in the movie , not taking themselves too seriously . and if you're the type of person who likes celebrity cameos in films , well , don't look any further because dozens of famous faces show up here including vince vaughn , billy zane , winona ryder , christian slater , david duchovny , natalie portman and many , many others . i especially liked andy dick's complete make-over as the masseuse . hi-larious ! but with all films of this type , there is bound to be some stuff that simply doesn't work . a few particulars which didn't strike my fancy included the bulimia and "" orgy "" sequence with christine taylor , the break-dance fighting , and i also never get why they use real countries in plots like this ( why not just "" make up "" a country , instead of zeroing in on a certain people ? ) . i also could have done with less of the taylor character in general , since she wasn't all that interesting and seemed to slow things down every now and then ( more zoolander , dude ! ) . but those few missteps were nothing compared to some of the more memorable scenes which definitely did work for me ! i almost pissed myself during the "" gas station "" disaster , absolutely adored the "" walk-off "" contest ( with david bowie as the judge , no less ) and appreciated many of zoolander's moronic one-liners ( "" i was a merman . . . a merman ! !

"" ) i also really liked the soundtrack and the pace of the film , both of which zipped and zagged , and established a nice rhythm to it all . again , it's to note that this movie is dumb and not for everyone , but my guess is that if you laughed at the trailer , you will likely enjoy many of the quips in the actual picture as well . if you thought the trailer was dumb , skip this dodo bird and go rent austin powers again or something , a film from which there is an obvious influence here . blue steel , baby . . . yeah ! ! ! where's joblo coming from ? austin powers ( 7/10 ) - austin powers 2 ( 7/10 ) - deuce bigalow ( 7/10 ) - dude , where's my car ( 7/10 ) - freddy got fingered ( 5/10 ) - jay & silent bob strike back ( 8/10 ) - joe dirt ( 5/10 ) - meet the parents ( 8/10 ) - say it isn't so ( 3/10 )"
"unzipped is a cinematic portrait of isaac mizrahi , an artist whose palette is fabric . ostensibly , the film is a documentary , but use of that term requires stretching its meaning . many scenes appear staged , and a great deal of cutting-and-pasting has been done in the editing room . the cinema verite effect is a conceit -- genuine spontaneity is at a premium , and everyone is aware of and playing to the camera ( especially would-be actresses like cindy crawford ) . director douglas keeve ( who was mizrahi's lover at the time ) freely admits that he "" couldn't care less about the truth "" but was more interested in capturing "" the spirit and love in isaac and in fashion . "" despite violating nearly every rule of "" legitimate "" documentary film making , however , unzipped is a remarkably enjoyable piece of entertainment . while it sheds only a little light on the behind-the-scenes world of the fashion industry , it presents a fascinating , if incomplete , picture of designer mizrahi . this man is the perfect subject for this kind of study -- he's funny , energetic , and eminently quotable . he has unusual views on just about everything , from fashion ( "" it's about women not wanting to look like cows "" ) to mary tyler moore ( "" between her and jackie kennedy , they shaped this country "" ) to style ( "" it's almost impossible to have style nowadays without the right dogs "" ) . unzipped also gives a glimpse into the creative process by which mizrahi turns an idea into a dress . it's almost certainly different that anyone would imagine . the designer draws on a variety of sources for his look , including nanook of the north and old bette davis movies , then enlists the aid of a ouija board to help form the collection . in particular , unzipped traces mizrahi's development of his fall 1994 line from its inception in the spring to the final fashion show , which highlights a number of prominent models , including cindy crawford , naomi campbell , kate bush , and linda evangelista . on the technical side , a number of interesting choices were made in filming unzipped . a variety of film stocks were used : super 8 , 16 mm black-and-white , and 35 mm color . there is a purpose to this beyond simple artiness -- the stock often serves as an emotional key to the movie , and , during the climactic fashion show , color is used to show the audience's perspective , while black-and-white is for the behind-the- scenes sequences . nevertheless , some viewers will be put off by this treatment . while unzipped isn't an expose on the fashion industry per se , keeve has enough clips of petulant models to make the viewer realize how tame robert altman was with ready to wear . overall , however , this movie is far more about mizrahi than anything else , and only when viewed from that perspective does unzipped succeed . when the designer declares that "" everything is frustrating except designing clothes -- that's beautiful and liberating , "" it fits perfectly with the image of him that unzipped has constructed ."
"dora ( fernanda montenegro ) sits behind a make-shift desk at rio+s major train station . she , in her colorful demeanor , offers a service that is unheard of in the states . she writes letters for the illiterate , who pass through , to try to find lost relatives , find love , or search after lost debts . she+s quirky , she+s elderly , she+s caring . totally trustworthy , right ? not a chance . once home , she never sends these letters , saving money on postage , and relishing in the drama contained therein with her neighbor irene ( mar ? lia p ? ra ) . one of the letters is sent by a young mother with her nine-year old son , looking for their father . shortly thereafter , she gets hit by a bus , and the son is orphaned . days go by , and the boy , named josu ? , roams around the station , hungry , desperate , and somewhat clueless to his predictament . through a series of circumstances too precious to elaborate upon , dora somehow takes a responsibility in trying to find josu ? +s father . this means leaving the security of rio , traveling to the outskirts of brazil , where unpaved roads , religious devotees and the poverty-stricken become commonplace . films like this remind me as to what i enjoy about some foreign films . it is an opportunity for me to get a fresh breath in another part of the world , so distant from my own . it does so entertainingly , and so heart-wrenchingly . and yet , it+s backdrop is merely that . the focus is on the minute transformation of dora , of how she learns to love this little kid , without being cloying or sentimental . the most interesting backdrop is the amount of religious dedication is in the film . dora being an amoral scam-artist , could care less about the amount of bickering between the candle-lighting of the catholics versus the bumper-sticker mentality of the evangelicals . but neither side is trivialized . she even begins to develop an affection for a non-drinking evangelical , who sees the problems with dora , if not initially . fernanda montenegro surprisingly got an oscar nomination for this very delicate performance , but the true marvel is that of vinicius de oliveira , who plays josu ? . he , like the discoveries of j ? r ? mie renier ( _la promesse_ ) and giorgio cantarini ( _life is beautiful_ ) , prove that the true acting discoveries may be outside of the united states . he is a natural , and never once grating . send a memo to jonathan taylor thomas ."
"the event of events is upon us . people have waited twenty-two years for the prequel to star wars and die-hard fans have been camping out at theaters for months to get tickets to see it . i don't think that america will ever actually recover from what this hurricane of a film has caused . it is not a bit of an exaggeration to say that this is the most highly anticipated movie in history . anyone who tells you "" it's just a movie "" is either lying or clueless . it is clearly obvious that after the waiting and the hype actually seeing the movie will be anticlimactic . the second coming of the lord could not live up to the kind of buzz ( which is far too weak a word ) that star wars epsode i : the phantom menace so effortlessly generated . but that does not mean that the film itself is bad . in fact , it is terrific . i strongly suspect that many of the people who were dissappointed by it have simply surrendered to the media machine and the inevitable backlash . it is set some decades before the events of the original 1977 star wars took place . the film focuses on the fledgling republic of planets and the conflict that is raging : the trade federation , angry at some tax raise that was recently put in place has invaded the small , peaceful planet of naboo . the republic sent two jedi knights ( people that can actively communicate with what is affectionately known as "" the force "" ) , qui-gon jinn ( liam neeson ) and obi-wan kenobi ( ewan mcgregor ) to negotiate . unable to stop the tide of events that was about to occur , the jedi and the queen of naboo ( natalie portman ) escape naboo and head for coruscant to try and get the republic senate to intervene . on the way they get sidetracked to a planet called tatooine , where they meet the movie's real focal point , young anakin skywalker ( jake lloyd ) . he is an innocent slave boy , but "" the force is strong with him "" so qui- gon is determined to take him with them to the jedi counsel and get him trained as a jedi . as any self-respecting star wars fan should know , anakin will grow up to be darth vader and give birth to luke skywalker . >from the beginning it is evident that this is not an actor's movie . around 70% of the characters , if not more , are computer generated in one form or another , and though the effects are seamless , the movie lacks soul . i think that although the computer has played an incredibly instrumental part in moviemaking this decade , cinema should still be a human art and the phantom menace nearly defies this . this is the lightest installment in the star wars saga thus far , with plenty of broad comic relief to go around , much of it courtesy of an irritating knew character named jar-jar binks . he's essentially a computer-animated sidekick who says things like "" exqueeze me ? "" and "" mesa go now , okeday ? "" , and although it is often amusing it is also inherently annoying . the visual effects are astounding ( although director george lucas often chickens out by cutting away from them ) and the movie is a thrilling triumph . if it lacks in plot and in acting it makes up for it through imagination and excitement . the climactic lightsaber battle ( oh , come on , as if you didn't already know ) , among other things , is outrageously entertaining and defines the term "" popcorn movie "" . what made me surrender and give this movie * * * 1/2 stars was the score by john williams . even though it does seem like the man scores every single movie that comes out these days , his work here is nothing short of brilliant . his use of opera during the climax really does add a punch and his ingenious way of utilizing the imperial march as a sort of prophecy is chilling . the phantom menace is probably most effective as pop nostalgia . when you see "" a long time ago , in a galaxy far , far away "" , when the familiar music plays , when the words "" star wars "" appear on screen , you'll feel a tingle even if you didn't see the movie when it first came out in '77 . it feels oddly exciting to be introduced to young anakin , a boy whose innocence , we know , will be taken away and who will soon cross over to the dark side . it is the perfect example of dramatic irony to see the jedi masters aspire to get him trained in the jedi arts ; we know that it will do more harm than good , but they do not . we not only feel more involved in the story , but we feel like we're seeing the beginning of a saga that we have cherished for years . the phantom menace , although lacking in human aspects of the story , is a very worthy installment in the star wars . it works as an action flick , visually eye-popping and often paralyzingly exciting ; it also works as an elicitor of memories , a piece of exquisite nostalgia . ? 1999 eugene novikov&#137 ;"
"sometimes a movie comes along that falls somewhat askew of the rest . some people call it "" original "" or "" artsy "" or "" abstract "" . some people simply call it "" trash "" . a life less ordinary is sure to bring about mixed feelings . definitely a generation-x aimed movie , a life less ordinary has everything from claymation to profane angels to a karaoke-based musical dream sequence . whew ! anyone in their 30's or above is probably not going to grasp what can be enjoyed about this film . it's somewhat silly , it's somewhat outrageous , and it's definitely not your typical romance story , but for the right audience , it works . a lot of hype has been surrounding this film due to the fact that it comes to us from the same team that brought us trainspotting . well sorry folks , but i haven't seen trainspotting so i can't really compare . whether that works in this film's favor or not is beyond me . but i do know this : ewan mcgregor , whom i had never had the pleasure of watching , definitely charmed me . he was great ! cameron diaz's character was uneven and a bit hard to grasp . the audience may find it difficult to care about her , thus discouraging the hopes of seeing her unite with mcgregor after we are immediately sucked into caring about and identifying with him . misguided ? you bet . loveable ? you bet . a life less ordinary was a delight and even had a bonus for me when i realized it was filmed in my hometown of salt lake city , utah . this was just one more thing i didn't know about this movie when i sat down with a five dollar order of nachos and a three dollar coke . maybe not knowing the premise behind this film made for a pleasant surprise , but i think even if i had known , i would have been just as happy . a life less ordinary is quirky , eccentric , and downright charming ! not for everyone , but a definite change of pace for your typical night at the movies ."
"that thing you do ! ( r ) tom hanks's screenwriting and directorial debut , that thing you do ! , has all the qualities you would associate with the most beloved screen actor of the moment : fun , lively , and oh-so-nice . it is the latter quality , however , that becomes a hindrance , for this '60s nostalgia trifle is so nice and sweet that it teeters on becoming bland milquetoast . that thing focuses on the wonders , a teen rock band from erie , pennsylvania that is suddenly thrust into the national spotlight in 1964 when they score a major dance hit called , of course , "" that thing you do ! "" the group's members are , naturally a diverse group : there's brooding lead singer and songwriter jimmy ( johnathon schaech ) ; girl-crazy lenny ( steve zahn ) , the lead guitarist ; a goofy , geeky type known only as the bass player ( ethan embry ) ; and the film's center , guy ( tom everett scott ) , the drummer who has aspirations in jazz . along for the wonders' ride to success is jimmy's perpetually neglected galpal , faye ( liv tyler ) . hanks proves to be a capable writer-director , deftly recreating the innocent spirit of 1964 , which hanks calls "" the last innocent year . "" the spirit is not only reflected in the period clothes and settings but also in the music , which , like the other recent period music film , grace of my heart , was expressly written for the film ; hanks himself had a hand in writing four of the tunes--but not the infectious title cut by adam schlesinger , which is guaranteed to stay in your head long after the end credits have rolled ( it's still playing in my mind as i write this ) . it should come as no surprise that hanks the director works well with the actors , eliciting charming , likable work from the entire cast , most notably hanks lookalike scott and tyler , who is remarkable in delivering the film's biggest and best dramatic moment . the work of the young ensemble is so natural that they truly convince as teens of the early '60s ; they do not appear to be '90s grungers playacting "" retro . "" yet for all the light , frothy charms of that thing you do ! , it's nearly nice to a fault . while this unbridled innocence in film is a refreshing change from all the sinful cinema around these days , there is not enough conflict to keep things consistently interesting . everyone is so happy , basking in the glow of overnight success , marvelling at it all--except toward the end , but even then the tone quickly reverts to sweetness , ending on an appropriately feel-good note . there isn't much of an edge throughout that thing--the only thing that is remotely edgy is hanks's turn as the wonders' manager--and thus becomes in danger of being so nice it's bland . but a little niceness goes a long way these days , and there's no denying the entertainment value of that thing you do ! ; it's just about impossible to hate . it's an inoffensive , enjoyable piece of nostalgia that is sure to leave audiences smiling and humming , if not singing , "" that thing you do ! "" --quite possibly for days . to paraphrase a passage from the song : though i try and try to forget that song it is just so hard to do every time they play "" that thing you do ! """
"Motorsports: Schumacher to drive Mercedes F1 car on Nürburgring Nordschleife Filed under: Motorsports , Mercedes-Benz In advance of this year's 24 Hours of Nürburgring race, and as a ""thank you"" to German motorsports fans, Mercedes-Benz has arranged quite the driving demonstration at the legendary German track. Seven-time Formula One World Champion Michael Schumacher will pilot a the Mercedes AMG Petronas F1 W02 - the team's 2011 F1 car that carried the Silver Arrow name - around the Nordschleife. As far as we know, this will be the first time that an F1 car will have lapped the North Loop since Nick Heidfeld drove a BMW Sauber car around it in 2007. This will be far from Schumacher's first go with the Nürburgring : In 2011 he drove a classic Silver Arrow Stromlinie W196 (pictured above) for a demo lap around the Grand Prix track, and in 2007 he infamously punted a Ferrari prototype on the Nordschleife . There's no word from Mercedes as to how exactly Schumacher will drive for his 'Ring run this time. Heidfeld's lap was slowed massively by his car wearing hard, demonstration tires and for slow-downs to film the event. We have every expectation that Schumi will be subject to the same demands of safety and public relations. Of course, having the all-time fastest lap of the Nürburgring Nordschleife in your CV is something that we'd guess might tempt the über-competitive driver, and he'll certainly have the car to make that happen. Stefan Bellof holds the record for the fastest-ever lap of the 'Ring in its current configuration and length, with a time of 6:25.91 in 1983, at the wheel of a Porsche 956. (Niki Luada has the record at the original length, with a lap of 6:58.6 in 1975, in a Ferrari 312T.) Pundits analyzed the fast bits of Heidfeld's 2007 run, and figured his full-pace time, on admittedly unsticky tires, would have clocked in at around 6:12. Again, we're not suggesting that Schumacher will have the green light to drive at full speed, but it does sound as though the now one-year retired driver is amped for the opportunity. Said Schumacher, ""Posting a lap in a modern Silver Arrow on the most beautiful and most testing circuit in the world, what a brilliant mix - it's every motor racing driver's dream!"" We'll keep our fingers crossed on May 19, and hope that the lap is a hot one.

Schumacher will post a demonstration lap on the Nürburgring's legendary Nordschleife in a MERCEDES AMG PETRONAS F1 W02 to say 'thank you' to his fans for their years of loyal support during his F1 career. This will be the first time since Juan Manuel Fangio's victory on 1st August 1954 that a modern Formula 1 Silver Arrow has driven on the Nordschleife at the Nürburgring. Schumacher covered part of the Nordschleife in the last Formula 1 grand prix at the Nürburgring in July 2011, however, that was in a Mercedes-Benz Silver Arrow Stromlinie W196. The W196 was the first Formula 1 Silver Arrow that took Mercedes-Benz to two world titles with Juan Manuel Fangio in the 1954 and 1955 seasons. During this period, including his success at the Nürburgring, Fangio achieved eight wins in all. Long before the start of the Formula 1 world championship in 1950, however, there has been a close connection between Mercedes-Benz and the Nürburgring; an icon was born on 3rd June 1934 when the Silver Arrow had its first outing on the legendary Nürburgring Nordschleife in the International Eifel Race. The car was silver because mechanics had worked through the night to strip away the white paint of the brand new Mercedes-Benz W25 racing car, so as not to exceed the maximum permissible weight. The next day, Manfred von Brauchitsch won the W25's debut race, beginning the legend of the Silver Arrow. Michael Schumacher brought his F1 career to a close last year at MERCEDES AMG PETRONAS. In April this year, Schumacher and Mercedes-Benz announced a long-term partnership that goes far beyond motor racing and Formula 1. The record-breaking champion will represent the brand as an ambassador and provide back-up for issues relating to future developments. Intelligence Drive – the safety and convenience system introduced by Mercedes-Benz – is part of his brief. Michael Schumacher: ""I have a lot of fond memories of the Nürburgring and am really looking forward to giving fans and friends from my home town of Kerpen, which is quite close to the Nürburgring, something to remember as they see me drive by. But it will be a fantastic experience for me too, driving along the Nordschleife in a state-of–the-art Formula 1 Silver Arrow, particularly in view of the fact that the Silver Arrow's legend began here.

Michael is clearly fast but after all the practice session crashes in his career and crashes he's had in the last 2 seasons I wouldn't let him go for a record at, of all places, the ring.

""" he's back , and it's about time . "" was the motto for this television series pilot ( i call it a pilot , i don't care what fox network says ) revival of the cult classic british tv show , doctor who , that spawned no series , which means there are no smart network execs out there ( not exactly news to a lot of people , i know ) . the motto was well chosen . the series was simple , it was about this time lord scientist called the doctor with thirteen lives who traveled around in a type forty spaceship called a tardis outsmarting all kind of alien baddies , including the evil daleks , and the master , who appears in this feature , played very badly by eric roberts . as good as this revival was , there is something missing from it to make sure it was really doctor who . is it the acting ? hell , no ! paul mcgann is just as good as any of the other seven guys who've played the doctor ( including his predecessor and off-screen friend sylvester mccoy , who appears once more for the regeneration scene ) . he looks right for the role , is a brilliant actor , and slips effortlessly into the role , the way my two favorites jon pertwee and tom baker would . daphne ashbrook brings class to her role as dr . grace holloway , the doctor's first companion that he kisses on screen , she is not your typical female companion who screams , and spends her free time making coffee for the doctor , she is a tough , spunky american , and ashbrook shows this well . young yee jee tso shows promise as chang lee , and i've seen him in other stuff in which he usually plays the punk kid who dies at the end ( this film included ) , which , imho , wastes his talent . the only problem with the acting is eric roberts . one time he had to say to mcgann's doctor , "" i always dress for the occasion . "" but he broke it up , and said it so slowly that it wounded up sounding like a song lyric , "" i always . . . dress . . . for the occasion . "" you need an actor less slow and less reliant on moving his hands to act , and who's also british , like mcgann is as the doctor . executive producer phil segal said he was casted because fox insisted on having one american star in the role . i dunno who thought of casting him , but if they're reading this : news flash : eric roberts is * not * a star ! he rides on his sister's coattails , and any hit movie he makes has nothing to do with him . is this problem the kisses to the past ? they have references to the show so subtle that non fans would not notice them , only whovians would , and they're good . is it the script or the movie as a whole ? the script is a classy piece of work , featuring a master who can spit slime out of his mouth and nice dialogue , and the movie as a whole is one fans will love , and it is a good stand alone viewing for nonfans to enjoy the series . so what is it ? simple : no plot . the master , on his last legs , sends for the doctor to rescue him after the daleks put him on trial on their planet skaro and exterminate him . the doctor attempts to take his remains back to gallifrey , but they accidentally land in san francisco , 1999 , december 31 , where the master , with young street hood chang lee's help , opens the eye of harmony , which will suck the earth through it at midnight if the doctor , with the help of female surgeon , dr . grace holloway , doesn't close it by then . virtually no plot . i was told the movie would've featured the daleks on screen and started with more of a courtroom drama between the master and the daleks , but a lot of rewriting went on on the set . that shows how smart people are , as it would have made the movie a hell of a lot more interesting , and that would've gotten a four star rating out of me ."

"" with that piece of dialogue , we are fully introduced to lester burnham ( kevin spacey ) , a 42 year old man trapped within his own life . lester works for an advertising agency . his growing dissatisfaction with his job is only one of the mid-life crisis he is suffering . estranged from both his wife and his daughter , lester starts to crack under the stress . his life becomes nothing more than a series of mastubatory fantasies , and sullen apathy . carolyn burnham ( annette bening ) , is the prototypical career woman/ homemaker . she carefully tends her rose garden , decorates her home with the best furnishings . but inside she is desperate . unsuccessful at her profession as a real estate agent , she drives herself into states of denial and self loathing that only feed her growing resentment towards her family . the third member of this anti-family is jane burnham ( thora birch ) , lester and carolyn's daughter . a young girl going through the typical stages of adolescence , but having to also come to terms with her families growing dysfunction . this funny ( and frightening ) slice of life is refreshingly simple . not one character is given less than is needed to identify him or her . some of the most telling characters are those that serve to highlight other characters . most notably is barbara fitts ( allison janney ) , the almost catatonic wife of retired marine colonel fitts . she has almost no dialogue , and seems to be either recovering from a stroke or suffering from one . colonel fitts ( chris cooper ) is an angry and frightened man . his rage directed almost singularly at his son , ricky ( wes bentley ) who has just moved with his family to the same neighborhood as the burnham's . in fact they are the next door neighbors . anymore detail into the personalities of these marvelously diverse characters would deprive one of the many pleasures and surprises to be had in "" american beauty "" . alan ball , who was the co-executive producer of the hit tv series "" cybil "" and creator of the new sitcom "" oh grow up "" , has fashioned one of the most insightful and expertly tuned screenplays to have hit the screen in the past ten years . not one character in this film rings falsely . and the depth of personality in each , is achingly honest and insightful . the plot detailing the last year in the life of a man as he tries to find his own self worth is so resoundingly cliched and at the same time original as to bring to mind such marvelous film work as "" the graduate "" or "" lolita "" . kevin spacey turns in one of this years most pragmatic performances . his lester burnham is an everyman caught up in the middle of a life that is spiraling into old age . finally unable to deal with the lost soul that he has become , lester tries to return to his youth . he quits his job ( actually blackmailing his employer for one year's salary ) , starts smoking pot , fantasizes about his daughter's girlfriend angela ( mena suvari , in a marvelous performance here ) , starts working out , and finally takes a job at the local fast food outlet . mr . spacey's performance is so remarkably subtle and ingenuous , that we can be certain that come oscar ? time , we can be assured to see him name among the five nominees . annette bening also turns in what may be the best performance of her career . carolyn burnham is a woman who has become so insecure as to be caught up in maintaining the facade of normalcy . unable to cope with her growing disillusionment , she forces herself to maintain her demeanor , driving her further and further into desperation , adultery and possibly murder . ms . bening makes the character of carolyn so compelling as to be identifiable to almost anyone . the slow and methodical turn from happy home maker to charnel house martha stewart is too frightening to express in words . thora birch holds her own against the talents cast with her . jane burnham is both an innocent girl caught up in what is a dysfunctional family , and a rebellious child ready to abandon them at any moment . her growing distrust and isolation from her family is something that many parents should view as a warning . she is the prototypical trophy child . when carolyn praises her daughter after a performance by her cheerleading team ( "" i'm so proud of you , honey . you didn't screw up once ! "" ) , the bitterness and resentment are palpable . thora birch is a young actress to watch . praise must also go to chris cooper who brings yet another angry father role to life with depth and resonance . colonel finn is a man in complete denial . his military upbringing masking a desire he is too repulsed to even comprehend . wes bentley as ricky finn is fine as the enigma . the boy next door who may be more foe than friend . a deceitful and calculating young man , whose voyeuristic proclivities mask a deeper and more profound understanding of life than any of the adults around him . mr . bentley's performance is the one troublesome note in the film . that is simply because the character is such a grand and complete liar , that one almost faults the performance for it . director sam mendes handles all of the particulars of the cast and the settings with a sure and composed style that is neither intrusive nor subtle . scenes of carolyn walking through the rain , carry an ominous fission that calls attention to the emotions of the character . the subtle cinematography by conrad hall is wonderful , capturing the season in all of it's harsh beauty ( fall has never looked so inviting , yet depressing ) . every nuance of "" american beauty "" begs it's audience to think and examine . it is a film that will be discussed and debated for years to come . and well it should , as it is simply one of this years best ."
"will hunting ( matt damon ) is a natural genius . for a movie character , that's usually a death sentence . it's a trait associated with what my brother calls "" too good for this world "" movies , like phenomenon or powder . forgive me for spoiling the ending , but will doesn't die . this is no formula movie . in fact , it's quite fresh and original . it's a character study more than anything , and that's not surprising , considering it was written by two actors : damon and co-star ben affleck . will works whatever kind of job he can get . first he's a janitor , then he works construction . off-screen he speed reads books on any academic subject that interests him . on-screen he hangs out with his friends , picking fights in robust , romanticized-hemingway fashion . lambeau ( stellan skarsgard from breaking the waves ) , a math professor , learns that the janitor ( will ) is a genius with a special talent for advanced mathematics . having confirmed he's not a fluke or a savant , he does what he can to get will into the education system . he is firmly rejected . finally , will lands in jail for one of his fights . lambeau can get him probation instead of prison time as long as will agrees to therapy sessions and to discussing mathematics with him . will ( barely ) decides to go for the therapy over prison . lambeau treats will like a son . he's proud of , and amazed by , will's accomplishments in mathematics . he encourages will and tries to give him structure , knowing that , with a little discipline , he could be bigger than einstein . will isn't really interested in academia . he knows he would be the best in his field , and therefore spend all of his time in an office , explaining math to people like lambeau . he would rather work construction , which breaks lambeau's heart . meanwhile , will attends his mandated therapy sessions . it's not long before he shreds all the therapists on lambeau's "" a "" list . will has read enough psychology to know the tricks of the trade , and how to keep them from affecting him . shrink after shrink refuses to return after will's mockery . lambeau's last hope is his old college roommate , now a psychology teacher at a small-time community college . knowing that will is going to try to shred him too , sean ( robin williams ) agrees to take him on as a favor to lambeau and for the chance to meet this next einstein . true to form , will finds sean's emotional weakness and attacks . but unlike the other shrinks , sean knows what he is in for and continues the sessions . like a foster mother with a fussy child , sean knows that the attacks are defensive and is able to take them in stride . like the foster mother , sean knows that time and quiet patience is the only approach . robin williams is excellent in this role . he's not an actor with a great range , but in the right roles he has great depth . in this movie , as in awakenings , there comes a point when the quiet , shy man accomplishes something of great personal importance , and a smile of pure joy spreads up to his eyes . williams is the only actor i can name who can make an audience cry just by smiling . i have compared will to a foster child and that's not entirely fair . emotionally , he has a lot to learn , but he is not a child . he has thought about his life and made rational decisions about what he wants . sean , his girlfriend , his pals , and lambeau all help him grow , but he didn't start out asking for , or particularly needing , help . his exceptional gift singled him out , and those who love him kept pushing him in the right direction . if i had to say anything bad about good will hunting is that it walks the line between drama and melodrama . it's too sentimental and uplifiting for a straight drama , but the emotions are too subtle for melodrama . it is emotionally engaging , but it's not quite larger than life . this isn't a problem per se , but at times i didn't know quite how to take it . but this is a relatively small complaint about a very good movie . a good movie allows its characters to learn and grow . it doesn't just happen ; it takes a good script , good acting , and good direction . good will hunting has all three . if you are at all inclined to see it , by all means , go ."
"if there's one thing in common about all of hollywood's major studios , it's that their productions are moving toward mainstream more and more . although twentieth century fox and new line cinema have spawned subsidiaries which specialize in independant or controversial motion pictures ( fox searchlight and fine line respectively ) , it's obvious there's no significant movement underway to promote inventive ideas at the theater . so when a movie like gary ross' pleasantville comes along , wrapped in a blanket of innovative ideas and served up on a platter of fine production , it's a welcome change of pace for all who frequent the cineplexes . although the atmosphere and buzz about the movie are cheery and lighthearted , pleasantville should not be mistaken for a no-thought movie . quite the opposite is true , in fact , as director ross skillfully brings a narrative with intense and intelligent undertones to the screen . the story , both about the joys of living life to the fullest as well as the social ills of segregation , captures the essence of statement-making in the cinema . not in recent memory has a movie carried such weight of theme into widescale distribution , and even if mass audiences fail to see the ingenuity of ross' work , it is still a testament that his picture was considered worthy enough . kudos to both he and his production staff for putting together this fine picture . it stars tobey maguire and reese witherspoon as two nineties teenagers who , through quite a bit of luck , find themselves zapped into a fifties sitcom named "" pleasantville . "" maguire , as the reserved bud parker , is perfect for the pseudo-world ; but the rebellious mary sue ( witherspoon ) is not at all made for the father-knows-best times . it's not long before she sets the town of pleasantville on end , and begins to teach the townspeople - in a quite unlikely way - what life is * really * like . soon hues of color creep into the black and white world , and while some embrace the change in the passion of realism , others fear the strangeness . at one end is a soda shop owner-turned-painter named mr . johnson ( jeff daniels ) and at the other end is a close-minded mayor ( j . t . walsh ) and his chamber of commerce ; but the two sides are simply fronts for a clash of ideas that soon involves the entire town . fine performances are turned in all around . maguire and witherspoon are effective as the leads , but the true complements go out to jeff daniels and j . t . walsh ( in his latest and final posthumous performance ) . daniels brings an atmosphere of awe , inspiration , and hope to his character , whereas walsh simply drips of sinister closemindedness - almost to the point where you can sense gene hackman's envy . for daniels , it's his most commendable performance of the last three years - or more - and for walsh , it's a complementary exclamation point on a fine career . also of lesser note is the supporting role by joan allen , and in viewing the entire cast works well together from start to finish . there's not much to dislike about pleasantville , and its dynamic nature makes it the perfect movie for those who want serious as well as those who don't ."
"what do you get when you slap together a movie based on a story by the legendary george lucas , directed by virtuoso director steven spielberg , and starring one of the biggest box-office stars in the world , harrison ford ? you get one hot-fudge-rockin' good time , that's what you get ! ! ! plot : professor/archeologist indiana jones sets out to find the long-lost mystical ark of the covenant before the nazis get their grubby fingers hands on it . adventures , snakes , romance and mucho action ensues . critique : astounding movie packed with non-stop action , stunts galore , an interesting story line , great one-liners , a solid cast , a catchy musical score , and all the fun and adventure that you could squeeze into a two-hour thrill ride . if you don't enjoy this film , then you just don't like action movies , period ! if you're young , you'll enjoy its humor , its cool action sequences and its gross-out factor at times . if you're a little older , you'll appreciate the interesting plot line , the romance , and yes , the mountains of adventure . watching this movie made me feel like a kid again , dreaming and fantasizing about fighting the bad guys , travelling to different countries , making the impossible , possible ! harrison ford is perfect as the every-man with the brains of a scientist and the brawn of an outdoors adventurer , and spielberg manages to achieve the ideal balance of action , fun , adventure and humor . now if you really want to have a good time , check into this movie on the same night as its two sequels , rent a jug of iced coke , truckloads of nachos and salsa , an adventure hat and whip , and prepare to gag yourself into a world of action-movie heaven ! little known facts about this film and its stars : this picture was nominated for eight 1981 oscar nominations , including best picture . it lost that award to chariots of fire , but did manage to win for best art direction , best special effects , best film editing and best sound . actor tom selleck was originally cast as indiana jones , but was committed to his hit tv show , "" magnum p . i . "" . in filming the well of souls sequence , the producers scoured every pet shop in london and the south of england for every snake they could lay their hands on . hence there are snakes that are identifiable from many different geographical areas . however , once all the snakes were on set , it became clear that there were not nearly enough of them , so spielberg had several hoses cut into lengths , and these were used as well . looking closely , you can tell which are the real snakes and which are not . an early draft of the script had indy travelling to shanghai to recover a piece of the staff of ra . during his escape from the museum where it was housed , he sheltered from machine gun fire behind a giant rolling gong . also in the same script , indy and marion flee the chaos caused by the opening of the ark in a wild mine-cart chase sequence . both of these scenes were cut from the script , but ended up in 1984's indiana jones and the temple of doom . this film begins with a shot of a peak in the jungle which is reminiscent of the paramount pictures logo . the same type of opening is present in its sequels . jock's airplane at the beginning of the film has the registration number "" ob-cpo "" . this is a reference to obi-wan and c-3po from george lucas' star wars ( 9 . 5/10 ) . also , the hieroglyphics in the well of souls include engravings of r2-d2 and c-3po . they can be seen on a post to the right of indy and sallah as they remove the ark . the script originally included a long fight between a swordsman and indiana with his whip . as legend has it , actor harrison ford was suffering diarrhea at the time , and asked if the scene could be shortened . spielberg said the only way he could shorten it was if indy pulled out his gun and just shot the guy . the entire crew laughed and that's how it was filmed . when indy first falls in the well of souls and is face to face with the cobra , you can see the snake's reflection on the glass dividing it and harrison ford , also some fingerprints and stuff like that . when indy is dragging along the ground , hanging onto the nazi soldier's truck with the ark inside , you can see the pad that he's being dragged on ."
"`we run tings . tings don't run we . ' -sound advice from capone ( paul campbell ) to his squaddie ( or partner ) , floyd ( winston bell ) . jamaican film , shot entirely on video , featuring a standard cop movie plot mixed with a dash of john woo-styled brotherhood morals ( and a little gunplay ) . capone , a tough as nails super cop , gets a transfer back to his hometown of kingston after successfully taking down some gangsters that have broken into his home ( while he was with his lady ) and killed his partner in front of him . when he arrives , he discovers that the ghetto where he grew up has gotten worse , thanks mainly to the crime boss wonie ( jamaican film veteran carl bradshaw ) , so named because his left hand has been amputated and replaced by a grasping hook ) . capone discovers that wonie has been smuggling guns inside shipments of charity supplies for the area churches and , much to his disappointment , also finds out his childhood friend ratty ( mark danvers ) has been helping him . torn between doing his job and protecting his best friend , capone must make some hard decisions in order to make things right again . directed deftly by first time jamaican filmmaker chris browne ( assistant director for such american films as how stella got her groove back and instinct ) , one hardly notices the film was shot on video after a while . shots are handled so efficiently that they quickly take on the nuances of the aforementioned john woo films , although the action isn't as hyperkinetic as most of woo's films are . the action scenes are handled with a kind of flair though , and eventually begin to take on a life of their own ( beyond the hong kong films that they are obviously patterned after ) . the make-up effects are particularly good in these scenes as well , with flawless squib work on display from the effects team . the cast is superb and listening to their dialogue , spoken with thick jamaican accents ( half of which have to be subtitled because of their extensive use of slang ) , just adds to the interest . paul campbell , as the `loose cannon' capone , essays his role perfectly , displaying the right amount of menace and compassion at the right times . mark danvers evokes sympathy as ratty , the part-time gun smuggler who is also trying to help the community by building football fields and organizing block parties to bring people together . unfortunately , carl bradshaw is given the least to do and his character as the crime boss seems ineffective ( largely because his underlings seem to run all over him ) , but then again , that could be the way his character was intended to be portrayed . the music in the film is composed of all reggae songs , and the soundtrack was produced by grammy award winning artists , sly and robbie ( who have worked with the likes of the rolling stones , maxi priest , bob dylan , james brown , grace jones , herbie hancock , bootsy collins , and carly simon among others ) . the end credit song , `we run tings' , by the group red dragon , is pretty decent and carries on the theme of the movie established early on by the quote that opens this review . oddly enough , desmond ballentine ( who plays the character deportee ) is well known as a pioneer in the realm of `gangsta' reggae as the performer ninjaman , and he doesn't contribute a single song to the film ( that i could see ) , which is virtually unheard of here in the us . at the time of this writing , third world cop has been put into limited theatrical release in the us , coming off of a six-month box-office breaking run in jamaica , where it holds the position as highest grossing film of all time ( bringing in $21 million in jamaica , which is roughly $500 , 000 us ) . palm pictures ( the company that released the offbeat , but entertaining six-string samurai ) is the company releasing the film and considering that their main focus is the dvd market , i can imagine that a disc will be available once the film has left theaters . chris blackwell , founder of palm pictures , was also involved in the production of another jamaican box-office smash in 1981 entitled countryman , so i'd say he has a pretty good track record . overall , third world cop is a pretty entertaining homage to the films of john woo , ringo lam , tsui hark , and many other action films by directors from hong kong . if action films are your thing and you don't mind intermittent subtitles , then you can't go wrong with this film . the performances and the story are solid ( if only a little cliched ) and the action is tight . i'm not sure what the other jamaican films released in that country are like , but apparently third world cop's honors are well deserved ."
"at first glance , it appears that the home alone movies are brainless slapstick intended for those with minds of 8-year olds . that's true of home alone 2 and i'd bet money that it's true of home alone 3 ( opening soon ) . but home alone actually has a lot going for it , and the cartoon slapstick doesn't get in the way . the mcalisters , all 15 of them , are going to france for the holidays . four adults and eleven kids are spending the night together before heading to the airport en masse . the littlest kid , kevin , is the victim of the older kids' cruelty . kevin's patience runs out when he learns that his plain-cheese pizza has already been eaten , and he's going to have to starve . he attacks his big bully brother buzz , who had been teasing him . the fight disrupts the already-chaotic dinner , spilling milk and soft drinks all over the table , a few cousins , and an uncle . the knee-jerk reaction is for everyone to blame kevin . nobody came to his rescue when he was being teased , but they all point their fingers when he fights back . the ultimate punishment comes from mom ( catherine o'hara ) who sends him up to the spare bedroom in the attic for the night . on his way up the stairs , he tells her that "" families suck "" and that he hopes never to see any of his family again . that night the power goes out , knocking out the alarm clocks , so the mcalisters wake up in a big hurry to get to the airport . in a surprisingly plausible setup , kevin is mistakenly accounted for , and the family heads off without him . it's interesting that , in a subtle way , his parents never noticed him missing because of their deliberate desire to separate themselves from their children . first they delegate the headcount to an older sibling , and second , they put all the kids in coach while they fly first class . they're two-thirds of the way across the atlantic before they realize they are missing a child . meanwhile , kevin believes that somehow his wish has come true . he's finally rid of his family ! life is a dream come true . he can jump on the beds , watch r-rated movies , eat gobs of ice cream and potato chips , and dig through his big brother's secret box . slowly , the novelty wears off and he settles into the mundane . he grooms himself , he does the laundry , he goes shopping ( "" i bought some milk , eggs , and fabric softener "" ) . he also starts to miss his family , not just for their company , but for the security they bring . the furnace in the basement is a scary monster , the old man next door is a snow-shovel murderer , and two crooks are trying to break into his house . macaulay culkin is cute but he isn't much of an actor . still , we can see that kevin's character grows , thanks to some good direction and editing . for example , acting has little to do with the emotional impact of the scene where kevin searches out a seasonal santa at night , just as "" santa "" is getting in his car . kevin asks the man to pass on his request - he wants his family back - to the real santa . he learned how to deal with the furnace . you turn on the lights and it's not so scary anymore . he goes to a church one evening and there he sees the snow-shovel murderer , who actually turns out to be a nice man . they talk about their fears and kevin learns that age alone does not make you less afraid . finally , in the last 20 minutes , kevin confronts his last fear - the bandits , head on ( literally ) . this last act is full of violent comedic slapstick , and after the movie's genuine dramatic setup , it is dessert . it's a lot of fun , and it doesn't overwhelm the rest of the movie . on the whole , home alone is a great holiday movie . john williams' original score has the sound and feel of holiday music without the disadvantage of being overplayed at the malls , and the christmas setting can put you in the mood for those family gatherings . but it does have its flaws . the smallest problem is that culkin doesn't act very well . as i said before , he is cute , but repeated viewings reveal more about how columbus covered himself than about culkin's insight into his character . the biggest problem is that during the cartoony coda , the villains threaten kevin's life about five times . instead of "" i'm gonna get that kid "" they say "" i'm gonna kill that kid . "" some might argue that the tone is the same , but i strongly disagree . mixing comedy with specific and viable threats of murder is a sociopathic faux-pas . i'll probably never see home alone 3 , and i wish i had skipped home alone 2 , but i do enjoy home alone almost every year . don't let your impressions of the others detract from the original , which has much more to offer than cartoon slapstick ."
"when _star wars_ came out some twenty years ago , the image of traveling throughout the stars has become a commonplace image . when the millenium falcon moves throughout the stars , we see constellations , meteor showers , and cool space-ships . when han solo goes light speed , the stars change to bright lines , going towards the viewer in lines that converge at an invisible point . cool . _october sky_ offers a much simpler image--that of a single white dot , traveling horizontally across the night sky . was it really only forty years ago , when sputnik was launched , and that before then , no satellites ever existed ? have we become so technologically advanced that we have forgotten that it was nearly two generations ago where people stood outside to breathlessly see a then-technological achievement , even though it was from the russians ? it sounds hokey , but when that scene occurs near the beginning of _october sky_ , i found myself caught up with the enthusiasm of homer hickam , played by jake gyllenhaal . determined to make a dent in the space race , he becomes transfixed with his desire to make a rocket that could fly like the best of them . it is films like this that we know the ending as we buy the ticket . when lovely teacher miss riley ( played by laura dern ) , suggests that he enters his findings into the national science fair , we know exactly who is going to win . but the joy in a film like this is in the little details . for example , homer is clearly not the strongest student in his class . if he has any strengths whatsoever , it is an undeterring vision , and a good organizer . it means that he may have to lose his reputation by associating with the nerdiest kid in school , who knows more about rocket science than he does . it means that if his father forbids him to shoot rockets on company property ( that is , the entire coal-mining town ) , he must walk eight miles one way , just to set up the rockets , which will fail , fail , fail , and fail again . homer+s dad is played by chris cooper , a favorite actor of mine since _lone star_ . here he plays the antithesis of the character he played in _matewan_ : instead of organizing union rallies , he is the head of the coal-miners , who is constantly wringing his hands against the unions . this is will be one of the great unnoticed performances of the year : note how multi-dimensional his character is . he is his son+s last nemesis , as one who most likely interferes with his son+s dreams . but he truly loves his son , and wants to see him succeed the only way he knows how . through coal-mining . because of his character , we can see how far we+ve come . the revolution of modern technology has allowed for us to see society advanced at a rate far faster than any generation before us . we don+t understand that there were the generations from the industrial revolution who knew of no other way to raise a family . the paradigm was shifting under the father+s feet , and he knew of no other life . so _october sky_ , far from being merely a feel-good inspirational film , offers much food for thought . and this is the best type of inspirational film ; the one that you take something with you . btw , the final image of the film is just as simple , is as strong a contrast as the aforementioned horizontal-moving white dot against the night-sky background . another commonplace image , to be sure , but it must have been breathtaking forty years ago ."
"warning : contains what the matrix is . rated r for sci-fi violence . starring : keanu reeves , laurence fishburne , joe panteliano some may be disappointed with the matrix . i'll tell you i was . i sat there and sat there and sat there waiting for something to happen . now wait wait , i know most of you loved it , and i'm not saying i didn't like it . what i'm saying is the first half was extremely slow . now seeing the trailer it makes you think the whole entire movie is one big special effects show . don't be fooled , this movie has a big story . and big chunks of talky moments . but i will admit the special effects and the acting were above par , deserving the rating above . ok now to the story . well this may take a while . ok first of all , our world we live in now , is not the real world , actually we live inside a computer generated world known as the matrix . a man played by keanu reeves is about to find that out , when is kidnapped and almost coaxed to go into the real world . he does so , and finds out that he can do anything , be anything he wants to be . but he has to fight a 'matrix skipping' bad guy , who wants to send him back to his own world or destroy him . laurence fishburne , his guide of sorts plays his character well as does keanu reeves . but i sat in the theatre for over and hour wondering where all the special effects were . yeah there were some in the first half but not enough . the trailer for this movie was really decieving making people think that this was a special effects laden movie . now for the second half , it is explosive , and saves the movie . some of the special effects and fighting were breathtaking . the sound , the music , and all the effects were effective , and the last hour kept us entertained . but with a running time of 2 hours and 20 minutes , this movie is at least 40 minutes too long . one would have wished for a better 'matrix' , but i do have to say , i did like it and i was entertained ."
"Official: VW confirms development of 10-speed dual clutch, 134-hp/liter diesel Filed under: Audi , Porsche , Volkswagen Each year, the Vienna International Motor Symposium showcases some of the up-and-coming technologies automakers are engineering for the use in passenger cars, and Volkswagen AG CEO Martin Winterkorn revealed some big developments VW is working on for its future products. Winterkorn discussed a multi-faceted approach that VW is looking to reduce its fleet fuel consumption and exhaust emissions. Some of the bigger news he discussed included a ""high-performance"" diesel engine that will produce 134 horsepower per liter and a 10-speed DSG automatic transmission. While no specific applications were mentioned, we can only hope this is for the Audi R4 we keep hearing about. Another topic he touched on that caused us to perk up our ears was had to do with VW's plug-in hybrid technology. While we know the PHEV versions of the Audi A3 and Porsche Panamera are on the way, Winterkorn also said that these two models will be followed up by Golf , Passat , Audi A6 and Porsche Cayenne plug-in models. Scroll down for a press release highlighting the automaker's future fuel-saving initiatives.

Ross RSS feed Google+ Posted Apr 26th 2013 5:43PM Each year, the Vienna International Motor Symposium showcases some of the up-and-coming technologies automakers are engineering for the use in passenger cars, and Volkswagen AG CEO Martin Winterkorn revealed some big developments VW is working on for its future products. Winterkorn discussed a multi-faceted approach that VW is looking to reduce its fleet fuel consumption and exhaust emissions. Some of the bigger news he discussed included a ""high-performance"" diesel engine that will produce 134 horsepower per liter and a 10-speed DSG automatic transmission. While no specific applications were mentioned, we can only hope this is for the Audi R4 we keep hearing about. Another topic he touched on that caused us to perk up our ears was had to do with VW's plug-in hybrid technology. While we know the PHEV versions of the Audi A3 and Porsche Panamera are on the way, Winterkorn also said that these two models will be followed up by Golf , Passat , Audi A6 and Porsche Cayenne plug-in models. Scroll down for a press release highlighting the automaker's future fuel-saving initiatives. VOLKSWAGEN PRESENTS FUTURE DRIVE SYSTEMS AT VIENNA SYMPOSIUM -Group Chairman announces 10-speed DSG and high-performance diesel engine -Plug-in hybrid most promising alternative drive system -Natural gas vehicles offer great potential for sustained mobility Vienna/Wolfsburg, 26 April 2013: Today at the 34th International Vienna Motor Symposium Prof. Dr. Martin Winterkorn, Chairman of the Board of Management of Volkswagen AG, gave a forecast of future drive system technologies. Areas of work being focussed on by Volkswagen include the development of a high-performance diesel engine delivering 100kW per litre of displacement and a new 10-speed dual clutch gearbox that reduces fuel consumption. Among the alternative drive systems plug-in hybrids in particular offer great potential. Winterkorn stressed that over the medium and long-term different drive system technologies would exist side by side. These would range from highly efficient internal combustion engines and natural gas systems all the way to hybrids and electric vehicles. On this basis the Volkswagen Group was working towards its declared objective of lowering the European new car fleet's CO2 emission level to 95g of CO2/km by 2020. Winterkorn emphasised that existing internal combustion engines still offer a lot of potential: 'Since the year 2000, we've reduced the fuel consumption of our TDI and TSI engines by more than 30 per cent. I'm convinced that by 2020 we can achieve further increases in efficiency of around 15 per cent.' Factors making this possible, he said, would include enhancement of the combustion process, intelligent lightweight design, innovative operating strategies and optimisation of friction levels and thermal management. Volkswagen also sees great potential for natural gas drive systems: 'The gas engine is environmentally friendly, economical and suitable for everyday use. The technology is fully developed and the vehicles are already on the market.' The best example is the new eco-up! - at 79g of CO2/km the world's most economical natural gas car. The Volkswagen Group will be systematically rolling out natural gas technology with the Golf TGI BlueMotion and the Audi A3 g-tron. Winterkorn: 'We need to make the public even more aware of the benefits of natural gas engines. Everyone needs to play their part in this: carmakers, politicians and the fuel industry.' The variety of drive system technologies is growing: the group-wide Volkswagen modular component system and its flexible architecture enable every kind of drive system to be integrated quickly into the new models. 'Over the coming years we will electrify all vehicle classes in this way and help electrically powered motoring to make the breakthrough,' added Winterkorn. In the medium term the first choice in terms of alternative drive systems is plug-in hybrid technology. This enables a purely electric range of up to 50 kilometres, a high level of suitability for everyday use by virtue of recharging from a socket at home and also complete flexibility for long journeys thanks to an efficient internal combustion engine. The Volkswagen Group's first plug-in hybrids, the Porsche Panamera and Audi A3 e-tron, will shortly be going into full production. They will be followed by the Golf and many other models, such as the Passat, Audi A6 and Porsche Cayenne. Volkswagen also presented at the symposium new technologies that are finding their way into the modular diesel component system's future engine generation. These high-performance diesel engines achieve peak power output of 100kW per litre of displacement and have a variable valve-train assembly, a high-pressure injection system at up to 3,000 bar and combined charging with the innovative e-booster.

Yesterday at 9:19 PM Report abuse Permalink It will be revolutionary if they actually get 134 hp/liter out of a production diesel. My interest is piqued. Yesterday at 7:44 PM Report abuse Permalink This is very interesting. The company that is striving to become #1 (and it already IS number one in some parameters) decided to put R&D money into more than 7-speed dual clutch transmission AND in 140 hp/liter diesel ... what does that tell you? To me, it tells me that proper car will not be built before they get a nice huge return from that investment - which is probably 15-20 years away from today. The proper car having NO transmission and using NO fuel to power 4 electric motors - one on each wheel. Wall St , you better take note. Elon, sorry for your luck.

I have a co-worker who brags about his Ford Freestyle (with ZF CVT) that now has almost 275,000 miles without any engine and transmission problems. Yesterday at 4:03 PM Report abuse Permalink Yes, and they announced a 3,500 NM car some time ago, which turned out to be a lie. They lied about their emissions, their sales, and covered a massive crash-test failure of the A4 in 2012. So allow me to be skeptical about what this main says. Yesterday at 3:26 PM Report abuse Permalink The 10 speed could be good for their ""offroad"" vehicles. Set the 3rd or 4th gear as ""1st"" for road driving and the lower ones could be used for as a sort of pseudo transfer case. High torque, low speed. Doubt it'll happen, i'm just thinking strange **** up. Yesterday at 11:22 AM Report abuse Permalink Yeah...that's work as well as my first Schwinn (geezer alert!) 10-speed. It had maybe three-four useful gears...the others were duplicates or so close that it didn't matter. Same with 27 speed bikes today....squirrely duplicative gears. A little work with a calculator and custom clusters can drop back to a thicker, more durable chain and 4-5 gears on the back and two at most up front...oops, back to 8-10 speeds. But make them wide-ratio. 10 speeds in a car just seems like a CVT with discernible shift points. And don't get me started on ZF transmission reliability and power handling capability or lack thereof. Yesterday at 9:47 AM Report abuse Permalink I think the car companies are engaged in transmission wars. Watch for a company like ZF to go ahead and introduce an 11 or 12 speed transmission, just because people will want to have it in their car to boast about. You have room to grow more gears in a RWD car, but you'd think they would run out of room for the FWD and AWD versions.

We had megapixel wars in cameras to the point when adding pixels (without increasing sensor physical size) lowered the photo quality. Phone screen sizes are making it impossible to operate them with one hand...

"national lampoon's animal house , made in 1978 and set in 1962 , remains one of the -- no , fuck that noise -- * the * funniest movie ever made . and this isn't just my opinion , either ; everybody knows this , and that's why about a gazillion inferior rip-offs have been made , trying to duplicate its success . ( pcu anyone ? and the first person to bring up glory daze gets decked . ) animal house takes place at the fictional faber college , circa 1962 , where the omega frat calls the shots . these guys are wholesome , clean-cut , model-citizens . . . i . e . a bunch of assholes . greg , their leader , is going out with mandy pepperidge , but since the silly bastard doesn't believe in pre-marital sex , their relationship never goes further than a quick jack-off under the stars . neidermeyer is the supreme-bozo of the bunch , walking around with his dick out kicking freshman ass and trying to impress the muff . also hanging around these losers is babs , future universal studios employee and serious bitch . now let's just take a peak next door , at the delta house . over here , anything goes : you wanna throw shit out the window ? okay . you wanna crush a bunch of beer cans on your forehead and pour honey-mustard all over your chest ? go right ahead . the frat's leaders are otter and boon ( tim matheson and peter riegert ) . otter is the ladies' man , going out with another girl every night , and boon is the comedian . he's got a steady-date , katy ( karen allen ) , but she's sick of playing second-fiddle to a bottle of j . d . then there are the others : pinto , a wimp ; flounder , a blimp ; d . day , a biker ; stork , who may or may not have brain-damage ; and last but not least . . . bluto ! bluto , played by the late , great john belushi , is the man . he's the kind of guy who slugs back entire fifths of whiskey then proclaim , "" i needed that . "" the kind of guy who puts a cream-filled snowball into his mouth , puffs up his cheeks and spits it out , and then says "" i'm a zit -- get it ? "" the story is as follows : the omegas are getting the deltas kicked off campus . the deltas , knowing that fighting the omegas is stupid , decide to go out with style , throwing a wild toga party and ruining the homecoming parade . this is the fucnniest movie int he history of the world . do yourself a favor and go see it ."
"every year , hollywood crowns a new "" it boy "" --a young actor pegged for major movie stardom . inheriting the mantle from last year's "" winner , "" matthew mcconaughey , is matt damon , and , like mcconaughey , he proves to be more than just a fresh young face , as evidenced in two radically different projects currently in release--john grisham's the rainmaker and good will hunting . damon has his first major starring role , a la mcconaughey , in a john grisham adaptation--in this case , francis ford coppola's take on the rainmaker . damon plays wet-behind-the-ears attorney rudy baylor , who , immediately after passing the bar exam , finds himself representing the mother ( mary kay place ) of a terminally ill young man ( john whitworth ) in a big-league suit against a negligent insurance company . while rudy's ( and the film's ) main concern is this case , he also finds time to protect a young wife ( claire danes ) from her abusive husband ( melrose placer andrew shue , in a mercifully brief role ) . written for the screen and directed by coppola , the rainmaker is the best grisham film yet mostly because it does not take itself too seriously . coppola's most notable--and effective--contribution to the tried-and-true grisham formula is a sense of humor about itself , which largely comes in the presence of danny devito ( as rudy's unlicensed co-counsel ) and golden globe nominee jon voight ( as the insurance company's hotshot attorney ) . the inclusion of the battered wife subplot feels rather superfluous , but danes is as superb as always . then , of course , there is damon , who nicely juggles the weighty ( the insurance case , the spousal abuse ) and the humorous ( rudy's often comical naivete ) requirements of his role without missing a beat . as good as he is in the rainmaker , damon showcases the depth of his talent in good will hunting , directed by gus van sant and written by actor ben affleck and damon himself . damon plays the title character , will hunting , a troubled young construction worker/janitor at mit who also happens to be a supergenius . in an attempt to steer this brilliant young mind in the right direction , an mit math professor ( stellan skarsgard ) taps his old college friend , community college psychologist sean mcguire ( robin williams ) , to counsel the abrasive , standoffish will and try to help him come to terms with his turbulent life . good will hunting is the touchy-feely enterprise its plot synopsis suggests , but to simply dismiss it as that would be to discount the true emotional chords affleck and damon's intelligent script touches . even though no one ( and , if so , _very_ few people ) can directly relate to will's burden of superhuman intelligence , the insecurities he suffers are universal . the material is brought to life by the terrific ensemble of actors . williams delivers a nice dramatic turn ; affleck , a hot up-and-coming actor himself ( chasing amy ) , turns up in a warm and charming performance as will's best friend ; and the ever-appealing minnie driver shines as will's harvard-schooled love interest . the clear standout in the cast , though , is damon , who bravely does not soften will's prickly nature but has such a natural ease with the audience that it is hard _not_ to care for him . so many names come and go with the fluctuations of the hollywood hype machine , but based on his impressive work in john grisham's the rainmaker and especially good will hunting , it is a safe bet that matt damon is one name we will be hearing a lot more of in the years to come ."
"synopsis : leonard shelby ( pearce ) is a former insurance investigator on the trail of the man who killed his wife . leonard has only a few clues to the murderer's identity ; to make matters worse , he suffers from a condition which inhibits the creation of short-term memories , meaning that leonard is always forgetting what happened just minutes earlier . because of this , leonard is forced to rely on notes he leaves for himself . "" memento "" traces the investigation back in time from its apparent culmination . review : "" memento "" is the sort of movie i wish i'd written ; i can think of no higher praise than that . i am envious that nolan has concocted such a brilliant , involved , original movie as this . an instant film noir classic , "" memento "" is virtually flawless . the script is unlike any i have ever seen -- a notable achievement in these days of recycled hollywood homogeneity . although the idea of starting at the "" conclusion "" of the plotline and then moving backward in time to the "" start "" is not entirely new , never before have i witnessed it executed with such flair and coherence . "" memento "" is endlessly exciting and inventive , a rare story which keeps the viewers guessing during the film itself , and mulling over its connotations long after leaving the theatre . and it is not merely an exercise in cerebrality ; there is plenty of action and an unexpected dose of humour to keep the proceedings lively . nolan's direction is equally effective , never losing its crispness and clarity despite "" memento "" 's challenging gimmick . and to top everything off , all the performances rise to the occasion . pierce is terrific as the troubled leonard ; moss shows great range as enigmatic natalie ; and pantoliano's teddy achieves a splendidly affable yet sinister quality . "" memento "" may be the year's best screenplay , and is certainly amongst the top theatrical attractions of 2001 ."
"earth is a harsh , unconsoling drama about the time when india gained independence from britain and the ensuing turmoil that engulfed the subcontinent . people who supposedly loved the same land and the same god found themselves in bitter conflict , as the country divided into factions fighting in the streets : indian and pakistani ; muslim , hindu , sikh , parsee . the story takes place in lahore , which was indian before partition , and pakistani afterward , regardless of what its citizens might call themselves . the action is seen through the eyes of lenny ( maaia sethna ) , a young parsee girl , but it is really about her nanny , shanta . shanta has a small circle of male admirers . two of the men are suitors : hasan ( rahul khanna ) , a hindu , and dil navaz ( aamir khan ) , a muslim . the others--sikh , hindu , muslim--are older ; some are married ; but all appreciate shanta , who is played by the stirringly beautiful nandita das . ( she also starred in deepa mehta's previous film , fire , the first part of a thematic trilogy which will conclude with water . ) in an early scene , the men are sitting in a park talking with shanta and lenny ; political tension in the country is growing as the day of independence nears . one of the men remarks , jokingly , that their little group is probably one of the last places in the city where the different religions can still get along . he is wrong : the men make barbed little comments to each other , spoken like jokes , but with an undercurrent of fanaticism . the tenor of these exchanges grows darker and more bitter as the movie progresses . it is easy to perceive , in these squabbles , the trajectory which ends in mass violence and slaughter . the group around shanta represents , in a sense , a united india , and shanta herself the ideal motherland--one which all love , which inspires hindu , muslim , and sikh to live peacably together . but the circle around shanta is sundered , as is the state . a sikh is persecuted , hides , then flees . another man is murdered . the group of friends will not meet again . the movie is rife with images of breakage and destruction : a plate shattered on the floor , a stuffed toy torn apart by an upset child , and , most brutally , when the tension escalates into violence , a man is held down , tied between two cars , and ripped in half by the opposing movement of the vehicles . it is a visceral and effective metaphor for a country which is being destroyed just as painfully . the crux of earth's plot is the transformation undergone by dil navaz . his sisters are killed in brutal fashion , by hindus , because they are muslim . dil navaz seeks solace from shanta , and asks in desperation that she marry him . but she loves hasan , and tenderly refuses dil navaz's offer . the combination of familial anguish and romantic rejection twists inside him , and it is easy to see how he is seduced by the growing mob mentality : the muslim cause gives him a motive to vent his anger and hate . despite the things he later does , it is to the credit of earth that it does not simply denounce dil navaz and those like him , but shows how circumstances can make decent enough men do monstrous things . the conclusion--the consequence of dil navaz's transformation--is rather abrupt . the story earth tells does not end . it just stops . it is an appropriate finish : giving us closure would have imparted , at least on an aesthetic level , a sense of resolution , of satisfaction . but there was no resolution for india and pakistan--they have been at war , on a small or large scale , for decades . since the personal dramas in earth mirror the political struggles of a nation , it is only right that those dramas should have no terminus . there is no healing to be had , no closure , on any level ( despite the needless , tacked-on ending , with voice-over narration from lenny as an adult , framing the story ) . earth is , in some ways , an unexceptional movie . it does not reinvent the wheel , following instead the standard pattern of historical dramas . but deepa mehta's directon is assured , and the issues she addresses run deep . earth does for india what movies like zhang yimou's to live and tian zhuangzhuang's the blue kite did for china : they show us the agonies endured by unremarkable people who had the bad luck to be caught up and smashed in the crucible of history . such films strike me as inherently valuable , even when flawed . they may be biased or inaccurate , but they bear the weight of human hardship , and this confers on them a nobility and gravity which other , more inventive films , often lack . it is notable that all three movies were banned in their native countries : the events shown may have happened decades ago , but they still touch a nerve . the issues tackled in earth have a particular urgency in light of the nuclear test bombings that took place last year . in the near future , india and pakistan may launch nuclear missiles at each other . at the time of the tests i had some understanding of the reasons why this might happen ; after seeing earth , i have a much , much better understanding ."
"up until about a year ago , john travolta's career consisted of those "" look who's talking "" movies ( notice how they never called them look who's talented ) and the 1991 bomb shout ( which was bad enough to make most people scream ) . but somewhere along the line , travolta got the starring role in the tarantino masterpiece pulp fiction and his career soared once again . weird how someone whose career was on par with the bee gees back in 1978 would experience fame and fortune once again , while barry , robin and maurice gibb could do no better than a 1993 straight-to-the-cutout-bin album aptly named "" size isn't everything "" ( and of course , they learned that sales are everything ) . but now travolta's back on the hollywood scene once again , and i think we all know why . four words : contract with the devil . and this has nothing to do with newt gingrich's "" contract with america . "" no , satan is much more humane . anyway , yes , travolta has sold his soul to the hairy host of the netherworld . how do i know ? i own the document in question . amazing what you can buy at those collector's shops for a few hundred dollars , isn't it ? get shorty continues in the vein of pulp fiction , with travolta as crime minion chili palmer . he goes to collect some of the mafia's money from a b-grade director ( gene hackman ) and suddenly finds out he wants out of the mob game and into the movie game . sure , a ruthless criminal like him is far too honest to make it in hollywood , but i guess that's beside the point . palmer is determined to get hackman's next project made , so he sets out to convince big star martin weir ( danny devito ) to star in the movie , bringing along down-and-out horror actress karen flores ( rene russo ) , who has already had affairs with hackman and devito . it doesn't take a las vegas odds-maker to predict that she and travolta will soon be hitting the sheets as well , after the customary sexual tension and denial , which has been used in every comedy from "" who's the boss ? "" to speechless . it works in this case , unlike "" who's the boss ? "" although it's interesting to note that tony danza has signed a contract with the devil also . complicating matters somewhat are the mobsters who have backed hackman's other films and want in on this one too , along with travolta's mob boss trying to track him down for defecting . get shorty is by no means on the same level as pulp fiction , despite the obvious similarities . this movie doesn't have near the amount of originality or depth as pulp fiction but it is definitely one of the most entertaining movies i've seen this year ( yes , even better than halloween vi ) . get shorty is my kind of movie , one that mixes intelligent humor with action and violence . i'm definitely going to have to check out the novel it was based on . are you getting this , shorty ?"
"i was fortunate enough to attend an advance screening for the upcoming thriller conspiracy theory . this was , of course , a big deal for me because reviewing movies is basically just a hobby for me and i never get a chance at something like this . not only did i get to see an advance screening , i was able to see an advance screening of a * very good * movie . the very fast-paced film stars mel gibson as jerry fletcher , a fast-talking , witty , comical taxi driver in new york city . gibson's performance is terrific , and his character is similar to that of martin riggs in the lethal weapon films . gibson again teams up with richard donner , as he did in the lethal weapon films and maverick , and this time around , the combination works even better . the character of jerry fletcher is indeed unique . try to imagine a toned-downed version of travis bickle who , this time around , is a jittery guy with knowledge of government conspiracy cover-ups . if you can imagine that , then you've basically got jerry fletcher . in many ways , i was surprised by this movie . to begin with , i was surprised at how good it was . don't get me wrong , it's not going to be accepting any gold trophies next spring , but it was a very enjoyable movie . secondly , i was surprised at mel gibson's performance . he provided a fantastic performance . the previews of this film led me to believe it was an all-out action flick , which after viewing , it was almost the opposite in a certain sense . gibson's character has an almost uncountable number of one-liners , hilarious situations , and his character is one that the audience tends to side with throughout the film . for instance , jerry's apartment ( and especially his security ) is memorable . and last , i was surprised at how good the plot is . writer brian helgeland has created a terrific story , and when watching this film , you are left to wonder if all of jerry fletcher's far-fetched ( or so they seem at first ) conspiracy theories are helgeland's own opinions . mel gibson isn't the only stand-out in the film . julia roberts is very good in her performance as alice sutton , the department of justice employee who can't seem to stay away from jerry fletcher , who continually visits alice in hopes that she will do something about his theories . he also seems obsessed and in love with her . but whenever he approaches her with another one of his theories , she shrugs him and his beliefs off , continually noting that one day she is going to slap a restraining order on him . jerry , obviously determined to continually seek out the truth , continues to research information for his next conspiracy theory , which will be printed in his newsletter ( same title as the movie ) . although he only has five subscribers , he puts a large amount of time and effort into his work , and publishes his next edition . very soon after he does so , he is abducted and tortured by a sinister man who refers to himself as dr . jonas ( patrick stewart ) . after barely escaping alive , jerry is forced to turn to the only person he can trust : alice sutton . the remainder of the film is almost always fast-paced and full of action and suspense , with jerry's life being constantly put into jeopardy . and more along the way , the audience ( and alice ) learn more and more about jerry's life . many things are explained throughout this film , both to the characters and to the audience . for instance , the meaning of the book "" the catcher in the rye "" and its ties to assassins , the reason lone gunmen have three names ( e . g . lee harvey oswald and james earl ray ) , and the real truth behind the grateful dead . make sure listen closely throughout the film , as jerry is constantly throwing out interesting tidbits such as the above . definitely , when conspiracy theory hits theaters august 8th , make sure you are standing in line to see it . i am nearly positive everyone should enjoy this film , especially if you are into an action-thriller with witty dialogue and numerous suspenseful situations . and even if you aren't , you should still like this film ."

"" mulan , "" their 36th animated adventure , is the latest case in point . once again we have a tale focused around a strong central character ( female as usual ; disney is one of the few studios whose heroines--ariel , belle , pocahontas , and now mulan--get equal screen time with their heroes in recent years ) . add the requisite love interest and a wise-cracking sidekick or two , pep up the soundtrack with a handful of strategically placed show tunes ( an introspective number by a pool or looking in a mirror , a rousing anthem , a cutesy , montage-backed crowd pleaser ) , pose a few threats to our engaging lead , and tie things all up neatly by the closing credits . bob's your uncle ! better make that walt's your uncle . . . kids will no doubt go ga-ga over "" mulan "" ( or at least the fast food tie-ins ) , but familiarity can , after a while , leave grown-ups--this reviewer included--wishing for a little more . maybe an animated feature without--shock ! horror ! --the songs , for example ? or maybe a film in which a cheeky chihuahua called pepe longs to become a matador from trinidad ? ? how about simply ditching the sidekicks altogether ? it isn't gonna happen . like disney's previous entries , "" mulan "" is slow to make its mark . the animation tends to suffer from some slackness in the early going and the humorous element , a madcap dragon wannabe ( in the guise of a loquacious lizard with a case of dry mouth , courtesy eddie murphy's animated vocal talents ) , plays like an inappropriate if necessary ( formula-wise ) afterthought . however , after about an hour everything comes together and the formula , like it or not , clicks . highlights include a spectacular cavalry charge on a snow-covered pass ( which , due to the sophistication of today's computer-generated imagery , is hard to tell from the real thing ) , a memorable , show-stopping musical interlude ( "" i'll make a man out of you , "" penned by matthew wilder and david zippel ) , and last but not least , mulan herself . voiced by ming-na wen , mulan is disney's strongest female character to date . when hordes of huns pour over china's great wall and threaten to overthrow the imperial palace , the emperor decrees that every family in the land dispatch one man to serve in the imperial army . since mulan's father is infirm , but proud , the high-spirited mulan steals her father's armor and , incognito , signs up to face the mongolian menace . attracted to , but not distracted by , her commanding officer shang ( b . d . wong ) , mulan outmatches her fellow combatants in smarts , wit , and physical ability . she's a woman of the '90s a couple of millennia ahead of her time ."

"ETC: These are the overloaded cars of South Korean workers fleeing North Korea Filed under: Government/Legal , South Korea Around 175 South Korean workers have been forced to pack up their belongings and leave a group of jointly operated factories in North Korea after tensions continued to escalate between the two countries. The workers piled tools and finished products high onto the roofs of regular passenger cars as they evacuated as quickly as possible. North Korea says the ongoing talks with its southern neighbor geared toward keeping the factory complex operational were ""deceptive"" given that the US and South Korean armed forces continue to practice joint drills nearby. South Korea , meanwhile, was concerned that workers could be deprived of food or medicine if the situation continued to sour.

"Official: Chrysler investing $20M in Toledo plant to support 9-speed auto production Filed under: Plants/Manufacturing , Chrysler , Dodge , Jeep In 2011, Chrysler announced a $72-million investment in its Toledo Machining Plant to modernize production of the eight- and nine-speed torque-converters for automatic transmissions made there. That upgrade work won't be finished until Q3 of this year, but Chrysler has already announced a further $19.6-million investment to increase production capacity for the nine-speeders. The extra units will be necessary because the nine-speed transmission they'll be mated to is going into three popular models: it will debut on the 2014 Jeep Cherokee , then go into the Chrysler 200 and Dodge Dart . The company predicted that this year alone it would sell 200,000 units equipped with the nine-speed tranny, and it is spending some $374 million in addition to the investment in Toledo to upgrade production capacity for it. The work attached to this new investment won't begin until Q3 of 2014, and it will be finished by the end of that year. There's a press release below with all the details.

Related Gallery 2014 Jeep Cherokee Trailhawk: New York 2013 Chrysler Group Plans to Invest Nearly $20 Million in Toledo Machining Plant - Investment to increase capacity for production of torque converters for new generation, fuel-efficient nine-speed transmission - Company's total investment in U.S. facilities over $5.2 billion since June 2009 April 26, 2013 , Auburn Hills, Mich. - Chrysler Group LLC announced today that it will invest $19.6 million in its Toledo Machining Plant in Perrysburg, Ohio, to increase capacity of the torque converter it's machining for the nine-speed transmission. With this announcement, the Company's total investments in its U.S. operations since June 2009 increase to over $5.2 billion. The new torque converters will be paired with the next generation, fuel efficient nine-speed front-wheel drive transmission being assembled at Chrysler Group's Indiana (Kokomo, Ind.) Transmission Plant I. The new transmission will debut in the 2014 Jeep® Cherokee. ""The new nine-speed transmission is a critical part of our strategy to meet fuel economy requirements over the next several years and Toledo Machining will play an integral role in bringing this transmission to market,"" said Scott Garberding, Senior Vice President, Manufacturing, Chrysler Group LLC. ""Securing this additional investment is a testament to the dedication and commitment of the plant's workforce and helps secure its future long-term."" The investment will fund the installation of new equipment and tooling for additional machining and assembly capacity. Installation is expected to begin in the third quarter of 2014 and will be completed by the end of 2014. In August 2011, a $72 million investment in Toledo Machining was announced to modernize the plant to produce the eight- and nine-speed torque converters on two new production lines and a new steering column for the Dodge Dart and Jeep Cherokee. These installations will be complete in the third quarter this year. ""We're very pleased that Chrysler is once again investing in the Toledo Machining Plant and the skilled workforce there,"" said General Holiefield, Vice President and Director, UAW Chrysler Department. ""This will help preserve and enhance jobs in the area and give a greater measure of security to our members and their families well into the future."" In February, the Company announced that it was investing $374 million in several of its Kokomo, Ind., facilities, including establishing a new manufacturing site in Tipton, Ind., to increase production capacity of the nine-speed transmission. Toledo Machining currently produces torque converters for Kokomo Transmission (Ind.), Indiana Transmission I and II (Kokomo, Ind.), Sterling Heights Assembly (Mich.), and Toluca (Mex.). The plant also produces steering columns for the following assembly plants: Warren Truck (Mich.), Belvidere (Ill.), Sterling Heights (Mich.), Toledo Assembly Complex (Ohio); Windsor (Ont.), Toluca (Mex.), Saltillo (Mex.), Arab American Vehicles (Egypt) and Carabobo (Venezuela).

As it turns out, that plan was foiled by the quick thinking of one Mercedes-Benz owner, diligent police work and the Mercedes-Benz mbrace system. When the brothers carjacked a 26-year-old Chinese entrepreneur identified only as ""Danny,"" they didn't realize his Mercedes-Benz M-Class was equipped with the mbrace system, which can call for help in the event of an accident or track the vehicle in the event of a theft. According to reports, the Tsarnaev brothers held Danny hostage for nearly 90 minutes while they drove around Boston forming a plan until they had to stop for fuel. When one of the brothers went inside to pay, the other put his gun down for a moment. Danny took the opportunity to unlatch his seat belt, open the door and run to another nearby gas station, where he told the owner to call the police. When police arrived, they used the mbrace system to track the SUV after receiving Danny's permission, and it wasn't long before a shootout between police and the brothers ensued. When it was over, the eldest brother lay dead in the street. For more on the story, view the video report available below .

"Video: Mom arrested for helping kids vandalize cars with BB gun Filed under: Government/Legal , Videos There are any number of wholesome ways to bond with your brood. Teaching them the finer points of the drive-by shooting probably shouldn't be one of them. That didn't stop 43-year-old Susan Becker piling her two teenage children into a car along with another teenage friend, arming the lot with pellet and BB guns and encouraging her posse to fire on parked cars. Becker bought the toys for her 13-year-old son and 15-year-old daughter, and a 15-year-old friend tagged along for the ride. All told, the team damaged at least 60 cars in and around Long Island as they fired from Becker's minivan. Police received reports from Islandia, Hauppauge and Commack communities, and some residents reported their windows smashed. Law enforcement used surveillance video to identify Becker's minivan and arrested the woman for multiple crimes, including endangering the welfare of a child and criminal mischief.

RENAULT IS TO UNVEIL A NEW CONCEPT CAR IN MONACO ON MAY 24 April 26, 2013 -- Like Twin'Z, which was unveiled in Milan, Italy, on April 8, the latest concept car to be designed under the leadership of Laurens van den Acker comes under the 'Play' heading of Renault Design's 'life-cycle' design strategy. The new car's revelation at the 2013 Monaco F1 Grand Prix will be followed by a series of other dynamic demonstrations at events such as July's Festival of Speed at Goodwood, England. This concept car was designed and developed entirely by Renault Design as an expression of the brand's passion and an illustration of how different takes on the same small city car are possible.

"Official: 2014 Toyota 4Runner revealed at Stagecoach Music Festival [UPDATE: w/video] Filed under: SUV , Videos , Toyota , Design/Style Toyota has just pulled the sheet off its updated 2014 4Runner at the 2013 Stagecoach Music Festival near Palm Springs, California. Toyota is the title sponsor at the festival, and claims that this is the first-ever global reveal of a new automobile at a major music festival. We're also guessing this is the first time that the 4Runner has seen duty inside what looks like a vintage circus act's cage . We can see from the photos that the body-on-frame SUV has received a freshened look with new smoked light fixtures front and rear, along with a boldly reworked front fascia and grille. The profile view seems largely unchanged, though there are new wheel patterns on offer. The 4Runner will continue to be offered in three trims, including SR5, more luxurious Limited, and off-road-ready Trail specification. Both 4x2 and both part- and full-time 4x4 models will continue to be available, all will be powered by the same 4.0-liter 270-horsepower V6 and five-speed automatic as last year. Other changes for the 2014 model year include a retouched interior featuring new Optitron gauges, a multi-information display, and changes in trim. On the entertainment front, there are new head units with Toyota's Entune infotainment technology and an in-glass antenna replacing the previous mast unit. The optional navigation unit features a seven-inch screen.

Related Gallery 2014 Toyota 4Runner New 2014 4Runner Features Rugged Exterior Design To Match Its Authentic Off-Road Heritage -Added Interior Refinement; Two- or three-row versatility -Body-On-Frame Off-Road Performance -Advanced audio and connectivity features TORRANCE, Calif., April 27, 2013 /PRNewswire/ -- For nearly three decades, the Toyota 4Runner mid-size SUV has been a stalwart for off-roading enthusiasts seeking a SUV with rugged, go-anywhere capability. Currently in its fifth-generation, 4Runner continues as one of the few fully capable mid-size SUVs, and the redesigned 2014 4Runner receives a rugged new exterior design, and interior refinements that add comfort and convenience without sacrificing its hallmark performance capability and excellent value. The 4Runner combines rugged body-on-frame construction with comprehensive suspension technology that yields optimal off-road capability with a smooth ride and comfort more often associated with crossovers. The 2014 4Runner is available in three grades: a well-equipped, value-driven SR5; top-of-the-line Limited, and a Trail grade for those who want maximum off-road capability. Optional third-row seats on SR5 and Limited allow for up to seven-person capacity. 4Runner owners will have the choice of a rear wheel 4x2, part-time 4x4 or a full-time multi-mode 4x4 with a locking center differential. All models are equipped with a powerful 4.0-liter, 270-horsepower V6 teamed to a five-speed ECT-i automatic transmission and one of the few vehicles that continues to offer a transfer case. 4Runner's Rugged Exterior Design Projects Its Off-Road Heritage With a Premium Refinement The refreshed 4Runner features a redesigned front fascia that conveys a more rugged and aggressive appearance. This includes a muscular front grille, and edgier smoked headlamps for a more forceful look. The SR5 and Trail grades feature a color-keyed grille insert and front bumper that is surrounded by fog lamps set in sharply cut inlays that extend from the headlamps down to the bumper. The Trail grade features new color-keyed bumpers and overfenders, and it continues to be distinguished by an aggressive hood scoop and silver painted front and rear bumper accents. All grades are now standard with a roof rack. In addition to the distinctive new grille, the premium Limited's front design stands apart with a chrome-plated grille insert and chrome front bumper that extends to the fog-lamp bezels. The side molding, roof rack and rear bumper are also chrome trimmed. The headlamps have also changed from halogen to projector beam, with both the headlamps and redesigned rear combination lamps on all 4Runner grades now featuring LED lamps. Both the SR5 and Trail grades will ride on 17-inch alloy wheels with a new wheel-design for both, while the Limited continues to ride on 20-inch alloy wheels, which are now painted black prior to machining to add contrast. All grades continue to come standard with a full-size spare. The 2014 4Runner will be available in eight exterior colors that include new additions: Super White; Attitude Black Metallic; Barcelona Red Metallic; and Nautical Blue Metallic. They will join carryover colors that include: Blizzard Pearl; Classic Silver Metallic; Magnetic Gray Metallic; and Black. New Interior Styling Has a refined style with the Comfort expected of a Mid-size SUV The 4Runner exterior updates are complemented by touches of refinement on the inside. Both the SR5 and Trail grade add standard Soft Touch door trim, and a leather-wrapped steering wheel and leather shift knob provide a premium feel and atmosphere. The SR5 receives a new bright and highly visible Optitron instrument panel that houses speedometer, tachometer, voltage, fuel and coolant temperature gauges, plus a multi-information display that offers multiple functions. An Eco-Driving feedback system allows the driver to monitor fuel consumption in real time. On 4Runner Trail, an overhead console within easy reach organizes the off-road control switches into one location. A compass indicator and outside temperature display add functionality. A manually controlled air conditioning system is standard on SR5 and Trail grades; the Limited features an automatic dual-zone climate-control system. For second-row passengers, a sculpted front seat-back shape provides additional knee space. The second-row seats, which include a center armrest, individually recline up to 16 degrees in four steps for relaxing passenger comfort. The 40/20/40 second-row seat configuration also has a one-touch walk-in function, making access to the third row easier. Third-row seating is available on SR5 and Limited grades and features a roomy, supportive seating area. The SR5 and Trail grade come standard with comfortable fabric-trimmed seating available in Sand Beige, Graphite or Black. Available SofTex seats offer a soft, rich feel. New for 2014, the SR5 adds a standard eight-way power driver seat. The Limited comes standard with a leather-trimmed interior with new ventilated driver and front passenger seats in Sand Beige, Black and a new Redwood color. Front seats are also heated with eight-way power-adjustable driver's seat with power lumbar support and four-way power-adjustable passenger seat. Both front seats are now standard with memory settings. Powerful 4.0-liter V6 Helps Take 4Runner Anyplace, Anytime The 4Runner 4.0-liter V6 generates 270 horsepower and 278 lb.-ft. of torque. Dual independent Variable Valve Timing with intelligence (VVT-i) optimizes torque across the engine's operating range. Fuel economy ratings rival some crossover SUVs with an EPA-estimated 17 mpg city and 23 mpg highway for 4x2 models, and 17 mpg city and 22 mpg highway for 4x4. Maximum towing capacity is 5,000 pounds and all vehicles feature an integrated tow-hitch receiver and wiring harness as standard equipment. 4Runner Balances Full Off-Road Capability with Smooth Around-town Handling A double-wishbone independent front suspension, combined with a variable-flow rack-and-pinion steering, help give the 4Runner precise control on demanding roads. Coil springs over gas shocks are used at all four wheels for a comfortable ride and controlled handling. The four-link rear suspension maximizes off-road axle articulation, whileproviding a smooth ride for rear-seat passengers on and off pavement. The Limited grade comes standard with an X-REAS suspension system that further improves performance, comfort and control. With X-REAS, 4Runner corners flatter, smoother, and handles choppy pavement more easily. X-REAS automatically adjusts the damping force of shocks when driving over bumpy surfaces or when cornering. The system uses a center control absorber to cross-link shocks on opposite corners of the vehicle, substantially reducing pitch and yaw by offsetting opposing inputs. The 4Runner SR5 and Trail 4x4 models have a two-speed, part-time four-wheel-drive system with neutral position, maximizing fuel efficiency when a 4x4 configuration isn't needed. The 4Runner Limited is equipped with a full-time, four-wheel-drive system with a locking center differential and a three-mode, center console-mounted switch. The A-TRAC traction control system is standard equipment on all 4x4 models. The system can distribute driving force to any one wheel in contact with the ground, making terrain irregularities and slippery patches virtually transparent to the driver. An electronic-locking rear differential is standard on the Trail grade. The Trail grade is designed to maximize off-road performance with superior approach and departure angles, high ground clearance, and an array of functional upgrades for the most demanding active outdoor enthusiast. The Trail grade offers an optional Kinetic Dynamic Suspension System (KDSS). KDSS significantly improves terrain-following ability by dynamically disconnecting stabilizer bars to allow for more axle travel, and better suspension articulation in slow, difficult terrain. Toyota's Crawl Control (CRAWL) feature is standard on the Trail grade. The system helps maintain an appropriate speed to keep the vehicle under control and minimizes the load on drivetrain and suspension components. With the transfer case shifted into low range, CRAWL regulates engine speed and output (along with braking force), to propel the vehicle forward or in reverse at one of the five driver-selectable low-speed settings. This allows the driver to maintain focus on steering over rough level ground or steep grades without having to also modulate the throttle or brake pedal. The Trail grade also features a Multi-Terrain Select system that dials in wheel-slip control to match the terrain. In loose terrain such as mud and sand, more-than-normal wheel slip is permitted, allowing wheel-spin to work in the vehicle's favor. On bumpy moguls, or solid rock, wheel slip is minimized and the system acts more like a limited slip differential. The Mogul setting is for any extremely uneven terrain, such as V-ditches, slopes, and ridges, uphill or down. All models come standard with Hill-start Assist Control (HAC), which provides additional control for off-road driving by helping to hold the vehicle stationary before starting on a steep incline or slippery surface. All 4Runner 4x4 models feature standard Downhill Assist Control (DAC). This feature augments the low-speed ascending ability of low-range by helping to hold the vehicle, allowing time for the driver to a target speed with no driver intervention. Versatility and Convenience Provide Comfort and Utility An array of convenience features and versatile seating configurations provide the 2014 4Runner with ample passenger comfort and utility. Fold-flat second-row seats provide a level load floor in the 4Runner, and it is not necessary to remove the headrests to fold the seats flat. The available third-row seat is split 50/50 and folds flat. The seats can be folded from the side or at the rear, using separate one-touch levers. With this arrangement, more cargo space is available without removing seats, and longer items can be conveniently carried. A Smart Key system featuring keyless entry with push-button start is standard on the Limited grade. The system allows the driver to unlock or start the vehicle by carrying the keyless remote. The cargo door window has jam control, like the moonroof and power side windows. An available pull-out cargo deck is capable of carrying up to 440 pounds to make loading and unloading heavy items easier and to provide seating for tailgating and campsite relaxation. All 4Runner models come standard with a 120V outlet and two additional 12V outlets. A front and rear clearance sonar system is standard on Limited models, and a rear-view backup camera is now standard on all 4Runner models. The system displays in the audio screen, increasing visibility at the rear of the vehicle. New Audio Systems Include Standard Entune™ Multimedia System New for 2014 on SR5 and Trail grade 4Runner models is Entune™ Audio Plus, which includes Toyota's Entune multimedia system, an AM/FM/MP3 CD player with eight speakers, integrated SiriusXM™ Satellite Radio (includes 90-day trial subscription), USB port with iPod connectivity, and Bluetooth® hands-free phone capability and music streaming. Standard on the Limited grade is the new Entune Premium JBL Audio system, which incorporates today's most in-demand connectivity features. It includes the Entune multimedia system, a JBL® premium sound system with navigation, SiriusXM Satellite Radio (with a 90-day trial subscription), HD Radio with iTunes® tagging and 15 speakers. The navigation system includes a large seven-inch monitor. Entune is a collection of popular mobile applications and data services, with three years of complimentary access. Once a smart phone is connected to the vehicle using Bluetooth wireless technology or a USB cable, Entune's features are operated using the vehicle's controls or, for some services, by voice recognition. Entune offers mobile apps for Bing™, iHeartRadio, MovieTickets.com, OpenTable®, and Pandora®. Entune data services include a fuel price guide, sports scores, stocks, traffic and weather. Standard on all audio systems is a unique ""party mode"" audio setting that is ideal for tailgating, raises bass response and shifts sound balance to the rear of the vehicle. Party mode is in addition bolstered by rear liftgate-mounted speakers, which function with or without party mode selected. The pole antenna has been dropped in favor of a new in-glass antenna. Toyota's Exclusive Star Safety System, Eight Standard Airbags, Safety Connect The 4Runner features Toyota's standard Star Safety System™ that includes Vehicle Stability Control (VSC) with traction control (TRAC), an Anti-lock Brake System (ABS) with Electronic Brake-force Distribution (EBD), Brake Assist (BA), and Smart Stop Technology (SST) brake-override system. VSC helps the driver to ensure control by compensating for front and rear wheel slip. The system uses selective braking and modulated engine output to help keep the vehicle in line with the driver's steering inputs. On 4x2 vehicles, the Auto LSD (Limited Slip Differential) system allows for better traction on slippery sections of roadway. The four-wheel ABS with EBD provides the 4Runner with optimal brake proportioning, regardless of vehicle load. Eight standard airbags includes front, side-mounted and knee airbags for the driver and front passenger, and side-curtain airbags for the second and third rows. All 2014 4Runners have active headrests for driver and passenger, and three-point seat belts for all seats. The 2014 4Runner Limited offers the Safety Connect™ telematics system. Available by subscription, with or without the optional navigation system, Safety Connect offers four safety and security features: Automatic Collision Notification, Stolen Vehicle Location, Emergency Assistance Button (SOS), and Roadside Assistance. When Safety Connect is ordered, it includes a one-year trial subscription. In case of either airbag deployment or severe rear-end collision, an Automatic Collision Notification system is designed to automatically call a dedicated response center. If a response agent cannot communicate with the occupants, the agent can contact the nearest emergency-services provider to dispatch assistance. Pushing the in-vehicle ""SOS"" button allows drivers to reach the response center to request help in an emergency as well as for a wide range of roadside assistance needs. If a 4Runner equipped with Safety Connect is stolen, agents can work with local authorities to help locate and recover the vehicle. 4Runner Includes Toyota Care Complimentary Maintenance Toyota's 36-month/36,000 mile basic new-vehicle warranty applies to all components other than normal wear and maintenance items. Additional 60-month warranties cover powertrain for 60,000 miles and corrosion with no mileage limitation. The 4Runner will also come standard with Toyota Careä, a complimentary plan covering normal factory-scheduled maintenance and 24-hour roadside assistance for two years or 25,000 miles, whichever comes first.

I appreciate that they are sticking with a true BOF SUV when others (Ford, Nissan) have abandoned the concept. Industry trends are stacked against this car. Toyota probably doesn't mind because it has the Highlander and RAV4 on the CUV side. But I can't help but think that the 4Runner would sell in better numbers if it wasn't so ugly. And a 4Runner from 20 years ago still looks so good. 1 hour ago Report abuse Permalink Spartan is what this vehicle is, but does it also have to be ugly? wtf were they thinking. 2 hours ago Report abuse Permalink With a little bit of work, this could look 100% better. It's clear it's just a quick refresh of the old model, so they went cheap. Probably a good strategy considering it's not a high volume vehicle. The mixture of curving sheet metal A pillar/windscreen, along with the B pillar front into the roof and the sharp pillars at the C pillar don't mesh. They should all be sharp. Secondly, go with conservative tail-lights. Off-roaders break tail-lights and don't want to be paying a metric ton to replace them. Obviously, the entire front end needs a re-design, and lose the hood scoop. The approach angle in glorious on this beast. 2 hours ago Report abuse Permalink Toyota is at it Again with their Conservative and very Non Competiive design staff. THis is an EPIC fail on 4Runner redesign. To not do anything with the powertrain is a total Joke. Still going with a 5 Speed ... No Way!!!

I think they are going to pay the price at Sales Loses into the 2014 model year against just about everyone else. THis is sort fo the same story with their Tundra and Tacoma ...

Related Gallery 2014 Jeep Cherokee Trailhawk: New York 2013 Chrysler Group Plans to Invest Nearly $20 Million in Toledo Machining Plant - Investment to increase capacity for production of torque converters for new generation, fuel-efficient nine-speed transmission - Company's total investment in U.S. facilities over $5.2 billion since June 2009 April 26, 2013 , Auburn Hills, Mich. - Chrysler Group LLC announced today that it will invest $19.6 million in its Toledo Machining Plant in Perrysburg, Ohio, to increase capacity of the torque converter it's machining for the nine-speed transmission. With this announcement, the Company's total investments in its U.S. operations since June 2009 increase to over $5.2 billion. The new torque converters will be paired with the next generation, fuel efficient nine-speed front-wheel drive transmission being assembled at Chrysler Group's Indiana (Kokomo, Ind.) Transmission Plant I. The new transmission will debut in the 2014 Jeep® Cherokee. ""The new nine-speed transmission is a critical part of our strategy to meet fuel economy requirements over the next several years and Toledo Machining will play an integral role in bringing this transmission to market,"" said Scott Garberding, Senior Vice President, Manufacturing, Chrysler Group LLC. ""Securing this additional investment is a testament to the dedication and commitment of the plant's workforce and helps secure its future long-term."" The investment will fund the installation of new equipment and tooling for additional machining and assembly capacity. Installation is expected to begin in the third quarter of 2014 and will be completed by the end of 2014. In August 2011, a $72 million investment in Toledo Machining was announced to modernize the plant to produce the eight- and nine-speed torque converters on two new production lines and a new steering column for the Dodge Dart and Jeep Cherokee. These installations will be complete in the third quarter this year. ""We're very pleased that Chrysler is once again investing in the Toledo Machining Plant and the skilled workforce there,"" said General Holiefield, Vice President and Director, UAW Chrysler Department. ""This will help preserve and enhance jobs in the area and give a greater measure of security to our members and their families well into the future."" In February, the Company announced that it was investing $374 million in several of its Kokomo, Ind., facilities, including establishing a new manufacturing site in Tipton, Ind., to increase production capacity of the nine-speed transmission. Toledo Machining currently produces torque converters for Kokomo Transmission (Ind.), Indiana Transmission I and II (Kokomo, Ind.), Sterling Heights Assembly (Mich.), and Toluca (Mex.). The plant also produces steering columns for the following assembly plants: Warren Truck (Mich.), Belvidere (Ill.), Sterling Heights (Mich.), Toledo Assembly Complex (Ohio); Windsor (Ont.), Toluca (Mex.), Saltillo (Mex.), Arab American Vehicles (Egypt) and Carabobo (Venezuela).

"Official: New Mercedes Unimog debuts to the cheers of little boys everywhere [w/video] Filed under: Truck , Work , Mercedes-Benz , Specialty , Diesel , Off-Road The Mercedes-Benz Unimog , the superhero villain of the off-road world that's just waiting to make the jump to Transformer, has been completely upgraded for its new generation. There are ten models, expanding the range and getting new designations across the traditional all-terrain series and the implement-carrier series. Panoramic cabins get more visibility, multifunction steering wheels and better dash clusters, improved HVAC and a three-mode central tire inflation system. Outside, there are new items like LED headlights and daytime running lamps in the bumper, roof-mounted windshield wipers and a front-camera monitor for the implement carrier. The new engine lineup is compliant with Euro VI, featuring four- and six-cylinder BlueEfficiency engines putting out anywhere from 156 horsepower to 354 hp. Powerplant placement has also been tweaked, the chassis members getting a revised curve to place the engine a bit further back and lower, maintaining off-road clearance and lowering the Unimog's center of gravity. The new location of the engine means the cabin has more room, and the wheelbase is shorter. Combined with a higher turning angle, the Unimog has a smaller turning radius than before. The implement carrier gets what's called a ""synergistic traveling drive,"" the bonus being that drivers don't need to stop in order to use an attachment - a hydrostatic transmission works with the regular manual transmission at up to 31 kilometers per hour for seamless switching.

New set-up for Unimog and Econic Strong new image for globally unique concepts - Unimog and Econic: Cleaner, more efficient, more powerful - BlueEfficiency Power engine generation with four-cylinder and six cylinder engines from 115 kW (156 hp) and 260 kW (354 hp) - Powerful and environmentally acceptable: Thoroughly renewed with state-of-the-art drive technology, control concept and cab - Unimog: New unique synergetic traction drive sets new standards in competition - Econic: Up to 4 percent lower fuel consumption - Econic: same payload despite Euro VI World premieres from Mercedes-Benz Special Trucks: A Unimog product range with ten new models at one go – from the Unimog U 216 to the Unimog U 5024 – and 2 and 3-axle versions for the Econic low-entry specialists vehicle introduce the era of Euro VI engines also for special vehicles. All this is combined with an appreciable increase in performance, efficiency and easy operation. Despite the challenges arising from the Euro VI emission standards involving additional components and an increased volume of 120 litres, it has been possible to retain and improve the concept advantages of the two vehicle product ranges. As the new Europe-wide Euro VI emission standards will be valid from 1 January 2014, Mercedes-Benz is rounding off its range of commercial vehicles including the Atego, Antos, Arocs and Actros by launching the two special vehicle product ranges Unimog and Econic to comply with the new regulations. The new engines have up to 90 percent fewer exhaust gas and particulate matter emissions than those used up to now. New structures for the Unimog product range In the new set-up for the Unimog implement carriers, the Unimog U 216 and U 218 replace the previous Unimog U 20 as compact entry-level models and are getting closer to the versions with stronger engines now known as U 318, U 423, U 430, U 527 and U 530. Here the first number denotes the size (for instance 4 corresponds to the current Unimog U 400), the following two numbers stand for the first two numbers of horse-power performance, for example 23 for 230 hp. They are all being launched with, amongst other things, a completely redesigned panoramic cab, new work and power hydraulics systems as well as synergetic traction drive which allows changing over from manual transmission to hydrostatic transmission while driving and all of these innovations make an appreciable difference to the efficiency of the Unimog. The extremely mobile off-road Unimog U 4000 und U 5000 have also been given a more advanced design in important details and are now known under the reference numbers U 4023 and U 5023. For the Econic – the 2 and 3-axle chassis versions now as 4x2, 6x4 and 6x2/4 with electronically steered forward and trailing axles – the concept of the low-entry cab has now been given more potential with a great number of important ergonomic innovations. In addition, it is clearly more cost-effective as it has reduced its fuel consumption and repair and maintenance costs. However the payload remains the same despite the Euro VI. Facing the future efficiently with BlueEfficiency Power Two BlueEfficiency Power model series engines with radically new designs ensure that the Unimog complies with Euro VI emission standards and is also much more efficient especially when using implements as here greater output is available. The Econic has also been given two engines from this generation: engine types OM 934 and OM 936 with three 4-cylinder and two 6-cylinder versions and performances ranging from 115 kW (156 hp) to 260 kW (354 hp) with cubic capacities of 5.1 litres and 7.7 litres. The state-of-the-art drive units combine low fuel consumption with extremely clean exhaust gas and ensure that the Unimog is on the road altogether more efficiently despite the great amount of effort invested in its construction to ensure that it complies with Euro VI. For the Econic it has been possible to achieve up to four percent lower fuel consumption. The engines - already successfully used in the Antos and Atego - are very convincing with their improved output and torque and clearly increased acceleration over the whole transmission range. Despite the Euro VI the fuel consumption of the Unimog has also been reduced. High-tech drive units from a state-of-the-art engine generation The new solenoid injectors with ten-hole jets provide the best possible injection for every working situation. These new, long-stroke engines with cooled exhaust gas recirculation and a specific engine output of up to 33.8 kW/l (46 hp/l) are among the most effective diesel units. The new 5.1 litre 4-cylinder version also produces a convincing top torque of 650 Nm for the entry-level model Unimog U 216 with 115 kW (156 hp) which remains constant over the whole of the main transmission range from 1200 to 1600 rpm. The six-cylinder gives a powerful performance The performance spectrum of the big 7.7 litre in-line 6-cylinder OM 936 follows directly on the heels of the extremely compact four-cylinder version. It is used in both the U 427 and U 430 as well as the U 527 and U 530 and here for both versions with 200 kW (272 hp) or 220 kW (299 hp). This means that the Unimog has been given top-level motorisation. The best torque result lies at 1200 Nm for the 1200 to 1600 speed range. The Econic has been fitted with 6â??cylinder engines providing an output of 220 kW (299 hp) and 260 kW (354 hp). Economy of space on compact chassis Great importance was also attached to economy of space when complying with the exhaust gas cleaning standards required by Euro VI which comes into force on 1 January 2014. This was a task which faced the designers with demanding challenges considering the compact chassis of the Unimog vehicles and also the low-entry concept of the Econic. In addition to the recirculation of the exhaust gas inside the engine, cleaning the exhaust gas also involves a system comprising the oxidation catalytic converter, a closed particulate matter filter, AdBlue injection and an SCR catalytic converter connected in a series. - END - New set-up for Unimog and Econic Unimog U 4023 and U 5023: Setting standards for off-road mobility - Perfection off-road, better handling with centrally-positioned engine - New BlueEfficiency Power Euro VI engines with higher output and higher torque - Chassis concept with torsionally flexible frame, torque tubes and coil springs retained - Strong and reliable, many details improved - New engine power take-off with increased applications The outstandingly mobile off-road Unimog with its new reference numbers U 4023 and U 5023 as the follow-up models for the U 4000 and U 5000 is now more environmentally acceptable and efficient, but still just as mobile off the road as its predecessors and even stronger – that means better all round. It is fitted with the new four-cylinder BlueEfficiency Power BlueTec 6 engine with an output of 170 kW (230 hp) and a strong torque of 900 Nm. The Unimog transmission has been improved and uprated so that the gear changing times are shorter with an increased life span. In future the gears will be changed using the pitman arm on the steering column and this also includes the electronic quick reverse function (EQR). As up to now, there are eight forward and six reverse gears available as well as the optional crawler gears for off-road use with a speed range between 2.5-35 km/h. The main difference between the two big Unimog vehicles lies in their axles and frames i.e. their axle loads and the gross vehicle weights which is a maximum of 10.3 tonnes for the U 4023 and 14.5 tonnes for the U 5023. Time-tried cab with a short bonnet radically reworked This cab is first class – it has left its mark on the appearance of the outstandingly mobile off-road Unimog since 1974. The designing engineers were confronted with the challenging task of installing technology complying with Euro VI and they succeeded by repositioning the engine one metre further back under the cab and this is now the core of the new concept. In comparison with its predecessor, the new cab has been lengthened by 120 mm and is slightly higher – and by moving the transmission controls from the central console to the pitman arm on the steering column there is much more space in the interior of the cab. This cab has also been upgraded with its new fittings: The multifunction steering wheel, adjustable steering column, pitman arm control, multifunction touch-keys and instrument cluster with a large display as well as a new stronger heating and ventilation system provide the very best conditions for the driver. The central tire inflation system ""Tirecontrol Plus"" has been redesigned so that the correct tire pressure for the prevailing conditions can be chosen simply and easily in the display with the pre-programmed modes ""road"", ""sand"" and ""bad surface"". From the outside the dynamic design of the radiator and the new bumpers with modern headlamps show at the first glance that here there is a new generation of the Unimog on the job. Also the access to the cab is completely new with easy to master and safe steps, two or three depending on what the customer requires. The altered position of the engine also allows power to be taken directly from the engine with an engine-driven PTO so that implements can be run independently of the driving situation unlike the transmission-driven PTOs which are still available. The big advantages of the extremely mobile off-road Unimog such as its outstanding handling over tough terrain remain untouched and in individual points its strengths have been improved. In the new model, the curving of the frame is now further back due to the central position of the engine and altogether the Unimog has a lower centre of gravity while retaining its high ground clearance which is extremely important for off-road operations. As both frame and tubular cross members are welded, this guarantees the extremely good torsional flexibility of up to 600 mm when driving cross-country. The axle articulation of up to 30° is made possible by the torque tube technology combined with the coil springs by connecting the torque tube and the torque ball to the transmission. Portal axles, the low centre of gravity and extremely good angles of approach and departure (at the front 44°, at the rear 51°), and ramp angles (34°) as well as its slope climbing ability (45°) all go to make the outstandingly mobile off-road Unimog just what it is – and in addition there is its fording ability of a maximum of 1200 mm as well as its side tilting angle of 38°. Driving in extreme situations is supported by the engageable all-wheel drive, engageable differential locks and the central tire inflation system. Unimog vehicles have a long life and they are robust and reliable. The completely welded frame and the enclosed parts of the chassis stand for the claim that the vehicle is able to stand up to great stress and strain. The axles are reinforced, all important power units and equipment are metal clad or installed in safe positions – and this is also true for fording ability within the guaranteed depth of 1200 mm. Extreme operations the world over All this shows quite clearly just why the outstandingly mobile off-road Unimog has such an excellent reputation all over the world. Working in extreme off-road conditions is the order of the day, whether it is fighting forest fires, for disaster control, crane operations, pipeline construction, expeditions, rescuing man and machine and last but not least for transporting crews and other people – in remote areas where the roads turn into bad tracks and rough terrain, that is where the Unimog U 4023 and U 5023 are on home ground. The Unimog is also looked after perfectly as far as maintenance, trouble diagnosis or repairs are concerned as competent Unimog Dealers are there to take care of the vehicles in over 650 service stations in more than 130 countries where special service packages and financial services round off the customer care. - END - Unimog U 216 to Unimog U 530: New powerful implement carriers - New entry models Unimog U 216 and U 218 - Work and power hydraulics - World premiere: Smooth changeover from driving with hydrostatic traction drive to manual transmission precisely designed for the job - Unimog versatility: Over 1000 implements and applications The product range of the Unimog implement carrier launched in 2000 is now being presented in the second generation with a new arrangement and new designations. U 216 and U 218 as entry-level models and the U 318 and U 423 are fitted with four-cylinder engines, U 427, U 430 and U 527 as well as U 530 have six-cylinder units. As the end of very work-intensive design engineering, the Unimog implement carriers are now once again at the starting block – more efficient, environmentally acceptable and cost-effective than their predecessors and in addition with their typical features greatly strengthened. New exterior: Panoramic cab with a modern design The panoramic cab presents itself in a new and modern design. Here the optical and functional effect of the short bonnet is emphasised even more by LED lamps including daytime running lamps integrated in the bumpers. To improve visibility, the windscreen wipers have now been fitted on the roof over the windscreen giving a superb view of both road and implements, and improved even more through the new front camera monitor system. Typical for the Unimog: The front power take-off reveals its powerful technology and power-hungry implements. New interior: Operating concept provides the best working conditions Multifunction steering wheel, adjustable steering column and stronger heating and cooling system with improved air flow make both drivers and co-drivers feel happy. The operating controls have been improved so that there is now a steering column pitman arm to operate driving functions such as gear changing or engine brake. The instrument cluster for driver information is new and has a large, light display; the joystick for operating implements can be removed and held in the hand; the uninterrupted view of the front implements – which is also important when attaching or removing them – is made safer with the monitor and front camera; and all this adds up to an appreciable lightening of the driver's load. Using the central tire inflation system ""Tirecontrol Plus"" (optional) is now much easier via the display as it gives the user the choice between pre-programmed modes ""road"", ""sand"" and ""bad surface"". New work hydraulics – more sensitive than ever The new work hydraulics set to precisely and without making any jerking movements – with at the same time about 30 percent increased hydraulic performance. This makes is possible to control the implements more sensitively than ever before. The work hydraulics is completely proportional when working and allows two movements to be performed at the same time via the joystick. The multifunction keys on the steering wheel and the display allow the output to be limited. The hydraulics works with two circuits, whereby Circuit I provides 200 bar system pressure with hydraulic oil flow of 32 l/min, together with Circuit II it adds up to an additional 55 l/min with up to 240 bar. And here the implement drive has been improved even further as the front power take-off now gives a performance of a maximum of 160 kW (up to now 150 kW). New compact entry models: Unimog U 216 and Unimog U 218 The two entry-level models U 216 und U 218 are completely new. They replace the previous Unimog U 20 and are now very little different from the bigger implement carriers above them starting with the U 318. Models U 216 and U 218 also have the same panoramic cab including the adjustable steering column and the other innovations, as well as the well-known unique VarioPilot where steering wheel and pedals can be moved to the other side of the cab when the operator needs to work from the co-driver's seat. The great advantage of the new models is their size with extremely compact dimensions. The wheelbase is only 2800 mm and is thus 200 mm shorter than the U 318, the turning circle is only 12.6 metres in comparison with 13.7 metres – by the way both of these turning circles are what are to be expected of passenger cars. Power is provided by the four-cylinder engines with 115 kW (156 hp) and 130 kW (177 hp). With three different load ratings from 7.5 to 10 tonnes, the payload of the U 216 and U 218 can cope with a great variety of tasks and applications. Unimog U 318 to U 530 Even greater performance, more manoeuvrable, more agile and able to do many more different kinds of job: such an all-round increase in efficiency is the trade mark of the Unimog U 318 to U 530. The engines produce a new peak performance as the 220 kW (299 hp) in the U 430 and U 530 provide the strongest hp output ever realised for a Unimog. The advanced work and power hydraulic systems profit a great deal from the engines. Greater efficiency is also provided by the greater payload. Here it was possible to reduce the weight by making savings on the frame and using aluminium wheels. It was also a brilliant feat to be able to shorten the wheelbase by 80 mm in comparison with the former U 300 despite the complicated components needed for Euro VI (U 318 and U 423). Because of this and with the help of a greater turning angle when steering, the turning circle is clearly smaller than that of its predecessor. New power hydraulics replaces power take-off pumps and special purpose body engines Power hydraulics VarioPower – for a long time this name has been behind the extremely powerful implement drive in the Unimog. Now it is even more efficient. Two circuits, each with 125 litres of hydraulic flow and 280 bar pressure can perform, if required, several different kinds of job at the same time or one especially sensitive operation – up to a top performance of 58 kW per circuit. This advanced design replaces pumps attached to the power take-off or diesel body engines, for example for mounted sweeping machines and this saves fuel, space and weight. And if the power hydraulics is not needed, then the Unimog can save weight in the vehicle frame – it can simply be removed from its installation location to increase the payload. This new system is operated using steering wheel touch-keys and its data can be read in the display in the new instrument cluster. The power hydraulics is available in Unimog models from U 318 on. The new synergetic traction drive The innovative new hydrostatic traction drive for the Unimog implement carrier is also a world premiere and it opens up a whole new range of possibilities for using implements. The combination of hydrostatic and manual transmission allows the driver to change smoothly from one mode to the other while driving. Up to now it was necessary to halt briefly before changing systems. The new comfortable Drive-Work-Mode can be used to advantage, for instance, when mowing grass verges and the work is interrupted by a long noise barrier. The new hydrostatic drive now allows speeds up to 50 km/h (31 mph) and the hydrostatic performance has been increased by 20 percent. Whereas infinitely variable driving and working reduces wear on the clutch and increases work performance, driving with the manual transmission saves fuel because of its increased efficiency. When using the electronic pneumatic power shift (EPS), the driver starts the changeover by pressing the clutch and so starts the optional automatic electronic drive control (EAS) to complete the changeover automatically. This new synergetic system is easily operated by using the steering column control switch, hydraulic joystick or alternatively the accelerator. Unimog implement-carrying design: More than a 1000 different possibilities The versatility of the Unimog implement carrier is legendary. In the meantime, more than a 1000 different possibilities are registered. Implement manufacturers worldwide work together intensively with Mercedes-Benz Special Trucks at the Wörth plant - where the Unimog now has its base – to expand the range of operations. The great advantage of the Unimog product range from U 216 to U 530 is its ability to use implements four-fold. There are three attachment points – front, rear and between the axles – as well as the space for mounting bodies and equipment on the chassis. The implements and equipment can be supplied with energy hydraulically, mechanically and electrically. The range of users includes Local Authorities, the energy sector, forestry workers, agricultural logistics, the construction industry or road-rail operators, but the list is long and includes many others. Whether it is working at the airport, cleaning solar parks or clearing snow across the mountains, virtually nothing is foreign to the Unimog and that it is exactly what makes it unique in the world of commercial vehicles - as a versatile implement carrier with the driving qualities of a truck. It also proves its value as a tractor unit with a 40 tonne combination and its technical top speed of up to 90 km/h (56 mph) is absolutely suitable for motorways. Directional stability, precise steering and the use of ABS are responsible for the high level of safety provided by the Unimog. In addition, the extremely good axle load distribution and four same-size wheels have a positive effect on the vehicle's handling qualities. And the Unimog sets its very own standards with the panoramic cab. The panoramic front windscreen, deep drawn down side windows and short bonnet give a very wide view of driving and working areas. What is quite new is the front camera system with a monitor which makes things easier for the driver as it shows him the area directly in front of the vehicle which makes it easier to attach implements. And last but not least, it is the good off-road mobility of the Unimog which speaks for itself: portal axles, high ground clearance, differential locks, single tires and the ability to rock out of dips (Electronic Quick Reverse). As far as servicing, trouble diagnosis or repairs are concerned, the Unimog is well provided for with over 650 service stations in more than 130 countries worldwide where competent Unimog Dealers are ready and waiting with special service offers as well as financial services to round off the entire package.

"Official: Audi testing long-tail version of R18 e-tron quattro for Le Mans Filed under: Motorsports , Hybrid , Audi , Racing Race teams are always looking for ways to shave hundredths of seconds of their lap times. Case in point: Audi is making some slight changes to its prototype racecar to make it ever so much more slippery as it cuts through the air. Debuting at the second round of the FIA World Endurance Championship at Spa on May 4, Audi will be testing a long-tail version of its R18 E-tron Quattro racecar. As its name suggests, the long-tail car gets a lengthened rear section with the goal of improving aerodynamics. The long-tail will be run alongside the standard version of the racecar as a testbed for possible changes that might be in store, heading into the 24 Hours of Le Mans . Audi did not say how many inches were added to the racecar, but as you can see in the image above, ""long-tail"" definitely doesn't take on the same meaning of classic long-tail cars of the past such as the Porsche 917 .

WEC Spa: Audi presents long-tail R18 -First fielding of three Audi R18 e-tron quattro cars -Premiere of a new aerodynamic variant -Last race preparation for the Le Mans 24 Hours Audi is pursuing ambitious aims at round 2 of the FIA World Endurance Championship (WEC) on May 4 at Spa. The version of the Audi R18 e-tron quattro that was victorious at the season opener is to extend Championship leader Audi's points advantage. At the same time, a new ""long-tail"" variant of the hybrid sports car will be tested in Belgium. Audi is pursuing ambitious aims at round 2 of the FIA World Endurance Championship (WEC) on May 4 at Spa. The version of the Audi R18 e-tron quattro that was victorious at the season opener is to extend Championship leader Audi's points advantage. At the same time, a new ""long-tail"" variant of the hybrid sports car will be tested in Belgium. Comparison in racing conditions: Two versions of the Audi R18 e-tron quattro that, also visually, can be clearly distinguished from each other will be running at Spa. The winners of the opening round, Loïc Duval/Tom Kristensen/Allan McNish (F/DK/GB), and the current World Endurance Champions Marcel Fässler/André Lotterer/Benoît Tréluyer (CH/D/F), will be starting with the aerodynamic variant that was victorious at Silverstone. It generates optimal downforce for track types such as the 7.004-kilometer circuit at Spa. The third Audi R18 e-tron quattro, driven by Marc Gené/Lucas di Grassi/Oliver Jarvis (E/BR/GB), on the other hand uses an aero package that has been optimized for the high-speed Le Mans track and can be recognized by its lengthened rear section. The comparison, however, is not focused on absolute lap times. Instead, the team will analyze the time differences to be expected between both models on individual track sectors. In addition, practical aspects of using the second body version will be reviewed and data generated for the fielding in the race at Le Mans. The focal point of the spectators' interest will yet again be the thrilling battle between World Champion Audi and challenger Toyota. In the seven meetings that have taken place since last June, the score is at 4-3 for the sports cars from Ingolstadt and Neckarsulm in the competition with Japan. The Spa 6 Hours will be held on Saturday of the first weekend in May. The TV channel Eurosport will cover selected stages of the race whereas the full racing distance can be watched on audi-liveracing.com on the internet. - Will Duval/Kristensen/McNish be able to extend their lead of the standings? - How well will the World Champions Fässler/Lotterer/Tréluyer fare? - How will the battle with Toyota develop? - Which manufacturer will travel to Le Mans with a points advantage? Dr. Wolfgang Ullrich, Head of Audi Motorsport: ""As always, Audi will be using the race at Spa as a 'dress rehearsal' for the Le Mans 24 Hours in June. Spa is a race track with a character that's completely different from Silverstone. We thoroughly reviewed the first race of the season and accomplished our tasks in order to be well prepared for the second round of the WEC. Fielding the Le Mans aero variant on the third vehicle that hasn't been optimized for the lap times at Spa is an important element of the preparation for the 24-hour race."" Ralf Jüttner, Technical Director Audi Sport Team Joest: ""The comparison with our competitor will start from scratch again at Spa. We can expect our opponent Toyota to compete with the latest technological update. For the first time this year, we'll be running with three cars. That means more work for our team. Spa's a great track and a race that definitely belongs on the WEC calendar. The new Audi R18 e-tron quattro was immediately reliable and fast."" Facts and quotes by the Audi drivers Marcel Fässler (36/CH), Audi R18 e-tron quattro #1 (Audi Sport Team Joest) - Drove the fastest race lap at Spa a year ago - Had to admit defeat at Silverstone by only 3.4 seconds ""Spa's one of my favorite tracks. In the LMP sports car, the circuit is a fantastic challenge. Eau Rouge, Blanchimont and the fast downhill double left-hand turn are particularly nice. Plus I like the ambience in Belgium extremely well."" André Lotterer (31/D), Audi R18 e-tron quattro #1 (Audi Sport Team Joest) - Regards Spa as his 'home' track - Is the runner-up in the standings after the 2013 season opener ""I grew up in Belgium and went to the track as a child. That's why Spa is always special for me. It's a fast track that should be suiting our car well. My two team-mates really enjoy driving there too. I'm hoping for us to be able to reverse the order of the top two results of the Silverstone weekend."" Benoît Tréluyer (36/F), Audi R18 e-tron quattro #1 (Audi Sport Team Joest) - Winner of the 2013 Sebring 12 Hours - The World Champion was the runner-up in Belgium last year ""For my team-mate André Lotterer, Spa is a 'home' track in a way. We'll be running for the first time now in this year's R18 e-tron quattro and the new tires on this track. Of course we'd like to be on the podium again right after Silverstone – ideally on the top though."" Loïc Duval (30/F), Audi R18 e-tron quattro #2 (Audi Sport Team Joest) - Won the Spa 6 Hours in the Audi R18 ultra last year - Leads the standings with his team-mate after the success at Silverstone ""I achieved my first victory with Audi at Spa last year. In May, the weather in the Ardennes is often unstable. Together with Allan and Tom I'd like to repeat the success at Silverstone and extend our World Championship lead."" Tom Kristensen (45/DK), Audi R18 e-tron quattro #2 (Audi Sport Team Joest) - The Dane achieved his first victory of the season at Silverstone - Ten years ago, he won at Spa in the Audi R8 ""Spa for us drivers, the cars and the teams is a huge challenge. It's a typical track from a different era with many vertical differences and corresponding compressions, with blind turns and frequently changing weather. The mechanics and all the other team members did an outstanding job at Silverstone. The pit stops and strategy were good. Spa's our last preparation in racing conditions before the biggest competition of the year at Le Mans."" Allan McNish (43/GB), Audi R18 e-tron quattro #2 (Audi Sport Team Joest) - Achieved the fastest time in qualifying at Spa last year - At the WEC opener in England, celebrated his first victory in an R18 e-tron quattro ""I always enjoy driving again at Spa. The track follows the topography in an ideal way. That's a hallmark of many good circuits. Some of the world's nicest corners are found at Spa, such as Eau Rouge or Pouhon. The races there are always thrilling, partially due to the weather but also because there are always surprises. The track is rough on the drivers, the car and the tires. In addition, we're expecting the competition at Spa to be tough due to Toyota. We drivers and our engineers have found a very good rhythm of working together."" Marc Gené (39/E), Audi R18 e-tron quattro #3 (Audi Sport Team Joest) - Won the race at Spa on making his Audi debut a year ago - Has celebrated three sports car victories at Spa since 2008 ""I'm looking forward to one of my favorite tracks that I've won at three times before. For us, it's the big preparation for Le Mans. The weather's often unpredictable. For Oliver Jarvis, Lucas di Grassi and me, it's the only opportunity to adjust to each other in racing conditions. Until now, I've only driven the Audi R18 e-tron quattro in tests. I'd like to repeat last year's victory."" Lucas di Grassi (28/BR), Audi R18 e-tron quattro #3 (Audi Sport Team Joest) - Is starting his third sports car race with Audi - Was the runner-up in the Sebring 12 Hours in March ""I'm experiencing my first WEC race in 2013 at Spa. I've got fond memories of this legendary circuit from GP2 and Formula 1. There's no nicer track if you're running in a fast car. I'll be starting with two different team-mates than I did at Sebring. We'll be able to gear up now for the biggest task of the year in racing conditions."" Oliver Jarvis (29/GB), Audi R18 e-tron quattro #3 (Audi Sport Team Joest) - Celebrated a class victory with Audi at Daytona in January - Won the Sebring 12 Hours in March ""My sports car career in Audi's factory team began a year ago at Spa. We immediately took a podium. It's a great feeling to return now. After a good race at Sebring I'm traveling to Spa even better prepared than I was twelve months ago. For the first time, I'm running with my two new team-mates. And we're developing the car with special aerodynamics for Le Mans. That'll be our personal warm-up for the 24-hour race.""

There's no other place where you can feel the centrifugal forces within your body as much as you can in Eau Rouge. Spa is the second-longest track after Le Mans and the weather is always changeable in the Ardennes. Eau Rouge remains the greatest single challenge. In Formula 1, due to the smaller engines and lower weight, you run flat-out there but in the heavier sports car Eau Rouge is even more extreme. Good overtaking opportunities exist in La Source, in front of Les Combes, in the double left-hand turn, on the Fagnes passage and in the chicane before the start and finish. The tarmac provides outstanding grip which is why slicks even work well when the track is slightly damp. In 2012, I celebrated my third sports car victory on this track with my team-mates.""

I've seen them race in person and truly amazing. But when they said long tail, I had images of the 917 long tail that truly stuck out a good 18 inches on those rear extensions. Not quite there, but still cool. Also, from the speculation last year, I got the feeling the top speed at Le Mans was due to the hybrid motors on the front axle bogging them down a bit at absolute top speed with extra mechanical drag? As I admit, that was speculation though. Maybe aero really was the limiting factor. Yesterday at 9:48 PM Report abuse Permalink Vorsprung durch Tecknik.

"SRI tackling Baja's General Tire Mexican 1000 in an electric buggy [w/video] Filed under: EV/Plug-in , Racing Whatdya expect, a Nissan Leaf ? Nope, the National Off Road Racing Association's (NORRA) General Tire Mexican 1000 off-road rally, which starts this weekend, will feature its first-ever all-electric vehicle, and judging by what we see above, it certainly looks the part. SRI EV1 , built by SRI, SRD and EV West , is an open-wheeled monster that delivers 535 horsepower and houses enough battery power to supply a typical American home. For a week. Concessions needed to be made to accommodate the electric racer, since as the SR1 doesn't have battery packs big enough to tackle all of the 1,200-plus mile race. The plan is to complete all three of the Special Stages on the first day and then run in portions of the distance on the ensuing three days depending on how the pack fares (there are no Blink stations in southern Baja, as far as we know).

Check out NORRA's press release and a short video about the SRI EV1 below . NORRA ""FORGES THE FUTURE"" THIS WEEK VIA FIRST ALL-ELECTRIC OFF-ROAD RACE CAR TO CHALLENGE THE LEGENDARY BAJA PENNINSULA Since 1967, the National Off Road Racing Association's (NORRA) Mexican 1000 has been a significant environment for creativity and innovation in off-road motorsports. Thanks to the technical and industry credibility of hot rod pioneer and NORRA executive Don Francisco, the unique Baja competition quickly rose to prominence via the participation of stars like of Parnelli Jones, James Garner and Steve McQueen. Why? From its inception desert racing's wide-open environment gave the automotive industry a new forum for brilliant innovators like Vic Hickey to create the original ""Baja Boot"" and the legendary Olds 442 ""Banshee"". That unique hot rodding legacy will return in a wholly unique way as NORRA today announced the entry of the first ever all-electric off-road race car, the SRI EV1 into this week's four-day General Tire Mexican 1000 rally. The fourth annual vintage-flavored on and off-road rally is scheduled to begin on Saturday, April 27 with a pre-event technical inspection, vehicle display and driver's meeting all taking place at the historic bullring in Mexicali, Baja, Mexico. A record field of 150-plus entries (up from 95 last year) will be made up of motorcycle, truck, buggy and sedan classes from an international list of entries, with a unique emphasis on vintage machinery and a distinctive spotlight on hospitality, adventure and fun. The EV1 is a full scale, 100% electric-powered race car built to resemble a modern Class 1 unlimited open-wheel machine. Designed by SRI, SRD and EV West, the car produces 535 HP and 750 ft-lbs of torque. Power is delivered through two 9"" Netgain WarP motors controlled via Evnetics Soliton 1 high performance controllers before being delivered to the dirt via a Mendeola S4D sequential gearbox. Team SRI's goal for the 1,200-plus mile Mexican 1000 is to successfully complete all three of the Special Stages on Day 1 from the start in Mexicali to the first overnight stop at Bahia De Los Angeles before running on portions of the remaining Special Stages throughout the event that fall within the EV1's range. This includes the final ""Secret Stage"" on Day 4 that precedes the official finish line at land's end in San Jose Del Cabo. Structured in a rally format instead of the more tradition, non-stop Baja endurance competition, the NORRA Mexican 1000 offers Team SRI a unique opportunity to demonstrate the capabilities of the EV1 thanks its multi-day schedule and a series of off-road Special Stages linked via on-road transit sections. Not surprisingly, the new EV1 is a one-of-a-kind hybrid that combines proven off-road racing technology with a cutting edge drivetrain. The Brenthel Industries chassis features a ride controlled by Bilstein Black Hawk 9300 series shocks on BFG Baja TA KR 35x12.50x15 tires balanced and protected with Ride-On TPS on Method Racing Wheels. Driver and co-driver ride in MasterCraft seats and harnesses. Power for the motors is stored in 138, 3.3v 180ah China Aviation Lithium Batteries (CALB) in two ""hot swap"" battery packs each containing 69 cells. Additional power for the car's Racepak, Baja Designs lighting, communications and GPS is provided by a 4-cell battery pack located in the driver's compartment. Total energy stored in the battery packs is 82kWh, enough to power an average home for about a week. ""This is a monumental undertaking that has been 18 solid months in the making,"" explained Strategic Recovery Institute founder Jeffrey Smith. ""Our entire team is excited about what we are stepping forward to do. We are confident that our upcoming Mexican 1000 capabilities demonstration will generate future battery sponsorship to allow the ability to 'hot swap' multiple battery packs andcomplete entire races in the near future."" The unique legacy of the General Tire NORRA Mexican 1000 to motivate and inspire is still alive and well. Like the unique mid-engine four-wheel drive Baja Boot that Vic Hickey built in the 30 days prior to the inaugural NORRA Mexican 1000 in 1967, the SRI EV1 will become living proof that innovation with an eye toward the future is a powerful concept that may never become obsolete. # # # ABOUT THE GENERAL TIRE NORRA MEXICAN 1000 Dubbed the ""Happiest Race on Earth,"" the unique off-road rally was co-created by promoter Mike Pearlman in 2010. Running this year from April 26 - May 1, each day of the rally consists of special stages (unlimited speed timed stages in the dirt) linked together by controlled speed liaison / transit sections (highway). The one-of-a-kind, once-a-year, four-day rally includes vintage off-road vehicles and motorcycles, rally cars, a limited group of modern desert racecars and classes for prerunner trucks and buggies. Pearlman's late father Ed and others established the first running of the NORRA Mexican 1000 off-road rally in November of 1967, which eventually became internationally recognized and evolved into the Baja 1000 in the mid-1970s. The NORRA Mexican 1000 is supported by General Tire, American Racing Wheel, South Point Hotel Casino, Walker Evans Racing, Azunia Tequila, KC HiLites, Bistein Shock Absorbers and Mastercraft/I mpact Safety. baja , baja 1000 , electric car , electric vehicle , ev , general tire mexican 1000 , national off road racing association , norra , off-road , rally , sr1 ChooseControl: Find Your Dream Car *0 / 3000 Character Maximum 0:43 - ""...You step on the gas...""...err....juice? 21 hours ago Report abuse Permalink Yesterday at 7:16 PM Report abuse Permalink 1 reply to HVH20's comment It was fabricated by SRD (Strategic Racing Designs), with from EV West, for SRI (Strategic Recovery Institute).

RIP I don't know if enough of others agree and I guess I'll see by the downvotes but it's concerning me that autoblog is posting anything news relevant with cars. I don't know if I'm one of the few but I come here to get away from tragic news, to enjoy my hobby and get away from politics and the real world which is cruel and ruthless at times. Now anything related to cars, whether it's a death, rape, accident, what next, drive by? and it gets a space here. Why? Is that really automotive news? At first I could somewhat understand the youtube finds even though I don't click them I figure they are light hearted but to come on here and read serious news just because there is a car involved or car in the background just doesn't seem right and doesn't seem fitting. And it's getting more and more space too. There are so many other places for news and tragedies around the world, do we really need to see it plastered here as well in the guise of car news? Yesterday at 4:41 PM Report abuse Permalink 2 replies to Jimmy's comment Since their motto is ""We obsessively cover the auto industry"" this is very much relevant. What isn't relevant is so many of the other things they post which are loosely related to cars but have nothing to do with the auto industry. 10 hours ago Report abuse Permalink They post everything the can about cars. If you don't want to read the news, don't click on the damn link. 8 hours ago Report abuse Permalink This is horrible, my heart goes out to the family. I will say I'm disappointed at Autoblog's article, though. It seems disingenuous to plaster a huge Nissan logo on the story, and call it ""the second death at the plant in recent years"" (with the undertone of suggesting that the plant is unsafe) when neither death seems to have actually been related to Nissan's procedures or the plant itself. The first one was a truck accident, and the more recent one was a contractor working for another company that 'makes paint systems for Nissan' and was probably in the process of installing the large electric panel that fell. The third article also mentions another accident where a supplier was seriously injured while repairing a machine. All of these things SUCK, but they don't seem to show the plant is unsafe.

Yesterday at 12:56 PM Report abuse Permalink the industry rather have the person die than get maimed, since paying off a life insurance policy is much cheaper than lifetime in medical care. So their policy is to make sure when they are moving the equipment, it is as big as possible and the person has to stand right under it Yesterday at 12:51 PM Report abuse Permalink 1 reply to LW's comment If someone gets hurt,and racks up a huge medical bill it can be bad news for the employee. We just had a guy at work get hurt doing a job he was told to do. He fell off a ladder,and hurt his knee. They gave him a certain amount of time to get well,and he didn\'t. The worker had worked there for over 20 years,and was near retirement age. He is also a huge man. I think the company no doubt saw him as a liability. He was outspoken about stuff too which didn\'t help matters. I just thought this was sorry as all get out esp. considering the man has also lost his Dad and a young grandson in the last year or so. Yesterday at 2:20 PM Report abuse Permalink Stuff does happen, but in the corporate industrial safety mindset there is no such thing as an ""accident"", someone is always negligent.

Yesterday at 11:38 AM Report abuse Permalink its rather odd that the Japanese government chooses to go public with this issue now, as Mitsubishi's issue with ignoring problems and refusing to issue recalls goes all the way back to the 70s. less than 20 years ago, they had major issues with their Fuso medium duty trucks and buses having brake failures, killing hundreds of people. the Japanese government ignored the problem for over ten years, until public outcry forced it out into the open. none of these issues could have ever been hidden without coverups and payoffs by Mitsubishi that went to the highest levels in the Japanese Government. facts like this shock many Americans, but graft and corruption are ""business as usual"" in Japan, and many other countries.

Mitusbishi just seem so corrupt and rotten it runs rife right though the company, the products design are totally yuk (Pig ugly L200 Triton just so very unpractical, no rear double cab headroom is totally the most useless gormless pick-up truck ever designed). I know folk that have had crankshaft pulley's sheared right off, Mitsubishi just don't want to know, fix the problem whilst still under guarantee, its like trying to ""squeeze blood out of a stone"" process trying to get them to fix anything that is a design flaw and their fault. To now hear they are not being proactive at coming foreword with vital recall information, it just does not surprise me one bit. Used to love their old products like the big boxy spacious practical 7 seater tough bomp proof Pajaro, that used to do so well winning Dakar rally year after year with some really great robust products in the past. Its a shame to see the absolutely abysmal products they put out today, they have very little to offer no wonder they are sinking fast. Yesterday at 10:13 AM Report abuse Permalink The Tri-Star? Why do writers try so hard to come up with cute pet names for Mitsubishi? The name means three diamonds, not stars. It isn\'t the Diamond-Star company either. The vehicle has problems because of the batteries. The batteries come from the same company that makes the batteries that is keeping the Boeing Dreamliners grounded. Yesterday at 10:09 AM Report abuse Permalink Of the smaller Japanese automakers, I respect Mitsubishi and Subaru, because they have kept their factories open in America and still employ people here. I do not respect Mazda, because they shut down their U.S. operations, laid off the workers and are now building a factory in Mexico. Mazda lost me when they did that - it's like spit in the face to the U.S. worker. Some people go out of their way to buy cars that are not built by Americans, so Mazda must be tailoring to that crowd now. Mitsubishi cars are actually very highly rated by Consumer Reports for their reliability and the Outlander Sport (built in the U.S.) recently won the Automotive Science Group Award for best overall small SUV on the market today. The Outlander Sport SE AWD is also the only SUV listed in the 2013 Consumer Reports car buying guide for the best picks in the ""under $25,000"" category. I think Mitsubishi has a marketing problem here in the United States that they need to overcome. Overall, MItsubishi is posting good profits worldwide these days, but they need to build more to tastes in the U.S. to survive here. For starters, they need to change the front grill of the new 2014 Outlander back to the Lancer jet fighter grill, instead of the new look. Maybe I'm out in left field with that opinion, but the new front grill just looks odd and will take away from all of the good changes that they made throughout the rest of the vehicle. Yesterday at 10:08 AM Report abuse Permalink Mitsubishi, as a car company, has been in a slow decline after the breakup with Chrysler. Although the two companies came up with a few very good products, neither had the depth of resources to make the alliance really work. Chrysler has found Fiat, and the merger seems to be working well for both as Fiat has a lot to offer and Chrysler has always been just short of being more than competitive across the market range with one or two ""best in class"" vehicles among a few also ran offerings. Right now the ""Three Diamond"" company has nothing to offer in a merger and I believe they will sell off their commercial vehicle operations and slowly go off into the sun set. I also believe that the Japanese automotive ranks will be thinned out some more as American and other Asian companies eat into their market.

"Tesla announces 'World's Best Service and Warranty Program,' hints at future 500-mile battery Filed under: EV/Plug-in , Tesla Motors , USA Tesla Motors has just revealed the latest edition of it 5-part announcement trilogy . Whereas the previous first installment had to do with the company's new leasing program , this episode is all about service and warranty, comes gift-wrapped in the glittery descriptor of ""World's Best,"" and is accompanied by hints of a future battery upgrade. The new plan improves on the California automaker's service program by adding a valet service that brings you a top-spec Model S Performance - or a Tesla Roadster , if you prefer - to temporarily replace your personal vehicle while it's being serviced. CEO Elon Musk states that this fleet of Model S service vehicles, which will initially number about 100, will ideally be less than three months old and also be available for immediate sale. Like your loaner more than your own car? You can keep it, paying ""a price that is lower by 1% per month of age and $1 per mile"" for your new ride and taking, likely, a similar hit on your trade-in. Musk hinted that a 500-mile battery would not be an unreasonable thing to expect in four or five years. Not only should the purchase scheme keep the loaner fleet nice and fresh, it may also create a cache of certified pre-owned inventory for buyers who are looking for a deal on a Tesla that starts at $69,900 from the factory, or who would rather not wait a couple months for a new, made-to-order car. As well as no-travel hassle, Tesla has also made its $600 annual service optional without effecting the standard 5-year/50,000-mile warranty. The company has also made the battery portion of the warranty unconditional, meaning that, if you manage to somehow turn it into a useless brick (something that should be quite difficult to accomplish with the Model S ), you will get a replacement unit of equal capacity free of charge. Speaking of battery capacity, during the media call, Mr. Musk also offered some hope for those anxious for packs that hold more energy than the current EPA-estimated 265-mile/85 kilowatt-hour packs now available. In response to a question about upcoming technology improvements, he hinted that a 500-mile battery would not be an unreasonable thing to expect in four or five years. He then added that, eventually, Tesla would likely offer owners the opportunity to upgrade their vehicles with longer-range capabilities. It all sounds pretty good to us, and we can't help but think if this upstart company keeps it up, surpassing sales of the Chevy Volt might seem a minor accomplishment.

It is a lot for regular middle-class folks like us. BUT, the car wasn't made for us. It was made for people who would buy a top-of-the-line Mercedes, BMW, Porsche, etc. Being that Tesla is a brand new company, they've been forced to make their first several models to appeal to only those people who can afford ultra high-end sports cars and luxury sedans (ie. The Roadster and Model S, respectively). This was done because they didn't have enough capitol to roll out the 50,000 vehicles it would've needed to do in order to satisfy that kind of demand. So they started out appealing to the ultra rich on the Roadster and used the capitol on those sales to create the S class. That capitol also allowed them to purchase a state-of-the-art factory and the ability to ramp up production. Now their using the capitol from the S sales to ramp up supercharging stations throughout the US to answer the range issues. They're also coming out with a sport utility version of the S next year and will parley those sales in order to make a much cheaper sedan (comparable to perhaps a BMW i series). The hope is to finally make a sedan perhaps closer to a Toyota Camry. But they will first need to scale up to the type of factory infrastructure that GM, Ford & Chrysler has in order to be able to compete and match the supply with the demand (which is VERY challenging for a small start-up). That being said; if they keep making a quality product, they will be very successful. And deservedly so. As for range being an issue. I think 265-300 miles of range for an electric car that can be charged at night while your sleeping for 75% less than gasoline is AWESOME! DOT statistics show that most people don't drive more than 20 miles per day. On the occasion that you have to take a long trip, there is (and will be many more) supercharging stations with which to charge up. So if you can afford it. My opinion is... Nothing beats this car. 3 hours ago Report abuse Permalink 2 replies to Jonathan's comment Tesla and their battery source have run out of money. The battery companies sponsored by the US taxpayers are out of business. Fisker, a Tesla electric car competitor, similarly high priced, is also in bankruptcy. Fiskers also was sponsored by the Obama gang of academics, with no business acumen. Billions have been spent on these two car companies and the battery suppliers, monies the US taxpayers have lost.

You have already been corrected many times so that means that you are actively creating FUD. Every one of your statements about Tesla can be proven wrong with a minimal amount of research. You are a troll. You are trying to create misinformation. Tesla received all of their loan and are actively paying it back. They have not and will not be asking for any more Federal money. You think you'd be trolling a Ford website since they received 12 times more Federal money than Tesla did. Ford got $5.9 billion for their loan that they will be repaying over the next 25 years! Tesla has vowed to pay back their loan in 5 years. They are currently paying back $15 million every three months with $30 million paid so far. Continued success means that they will continue to pay down the loan. But you are so afraid of them that you would prefer they fail to fit your sick and twisted agenda of fear. You are a cowardly troll.

"Motorsports: Schumacher to drive Mercedes F1 car on Nürburgring Nordschleife Filed under: Motorsports , Mercedes-Benz In advance of this year's 24 Hours of Nürburgring race, and as a ""thank you"" to German motorsports fans, Mercedes-Benz has arranged quite the driving demonstration at the legendary German track. Seven-time Formula One World Champion Michael Schumacher will pilot a the Mercedes AMG Petronas F1 W02 - the team's 2011 F1 car that carried the Silver Arrow name - around the Nordschleife. As far as we know, this will be the first time that an F1 car will have lapped the North Loop since Nick Heidfeld drove a BMW Sauber car around it in 2007. This will be far from Schumacher's first go with the Nürburgring : In 2011 he drove a classic Silver Arrow Stromlinie W196 (pictured above) for a demo lap around the Grand Prix track, and in 2007 he infamously punted a Ferrari prototype on the Nordschleife . There's no word from Mercedes as to how exactly Schumacher will drive for his 'Ring run this time. Heidfeld's lap was slowed massively by his car wearing hard, demonstration tires and for slow-downs to film the event. We have every expectation that Schumi will be subject to the same demands of safety and public relations. Of course, having the all-time fastest lap of the Nürburgring Nordschleife in your CV is something that we'd guess might tempt the über-competitive driver, and he'll certainly have the car to make that happen. Stefan Bellof holds the record for the fastest-ever lap of the 'Ring in its current configuration and length, with a time of 6:25.91 in 1983, at the wheel of a Porsche 956. (Niki Luada has the record at the original length, with a lap of 6:58.6 in 1975, in a Ferrari 312T.) Pundits analyzed the fast bits of Heidfeld's 2007 run, and figured his full-pace time, on admittedly unsticky tires, would have clocked in at around 6:12. Again, we're not suggesting that Schumacher will have the green light to drive at full speed, but it does sound as though the now one-year retired driver is amped for the opportunity. Said Schumacher, ""Posting a lap in a modern Silver Arrow on the most beautiful and most testing circuit in the world, what a brilliant mix - it's every motor racing driver's dream!"" We'll keep our fingers crossed on May 19, and hope that the lap is a hot one.

Related Gallery Michael Schumacher To Drive F1 Car On Nurburgring Michael Schumacher to drive 2011 Formula 1 Silver Arrow on Nürburgring Nordschleife Stuttgart, Apr 25, 2013 - Formula 1 record-breaking world champion Michael Schumacher will take to the track in the run-up to the 24-hour race at the Nürburgring on 19th May - A big 'thank you' to loyal German fans - First outing for a modern Formula 1 Silver Arrow at the Nürburgring Nordschleife since Juan Manuel Fangio's victory in 1954 On Sunday 19th May 2013 before the start of the 24-hour race around the Nürburgring, seven-time Formula 1 world champion Michael Schumacher will take to the track. Schumacher will post a demonstration lap on the Nürburgring's legendary Nordschleife in a MERCEDES AMG PETRONAS F1 W02 to say 'thank you' to his fans for their years of loyal support during his F1 career. This will be the first time since Juan Manuel Fangio's victory on 1st August 1954 that a modern Formula 1 Silver Arrow has driven on the Nordschleife at the Nürburgring. Schumacher covered part of the Nordschleife in the last Formula 1 grand prix at the Nürburgring in July 2011, however, that was in a Mercedes-Benz Silver Arrow Stromlinie W196. The W196 was the first Formula 1 Silver Arrow that took Mercedes-Benz to two world titles with Juan Manuel Fangio in the 1954 and 1955 seasons. During this period, including his success at the Nürburgring, Fangio achieved eight wins in all. Long before the start of the Formula 1 world championship in 1950, however, there has been a close connection between Mercedes-Benz and the Nürburgring; an icon was born on 3rd June 1934 when the Silver Arrow had its first outing on the legendary Nürburgring Nordschleife in the International Eifel Race. The car was silver because mechanics had worked through the night to strip away the white paint of the brand new Mercedes-Benz W25 racing car, so as not to exceed the maximum permissible weight. The next day, Manfred von Brauchitsch won the W25's debut race, beginning the legend of the Silver Arrow. Michael Schumacher brought his F1 career to a close last year at MERCEDES AMG PETRONAS. In April this year, Schumacher and Mercedes-Benz announced a long-term partnership that goes far beyond motor racing and Formula 1. The record-breaking champion will represent the brand as an ambassador and provide back-up for issues relating to future developments. Intelligence Drive – the safety and convenience system introduced by Mercedes-Benz – is part of his brief. Michael Schumacher: ""I have a lot of fond memories of the Nürburgring and am really looking forward to giving fans and friends from my home town of Kerpen, which is quite close to the Nürburgring, something to remember as they see me drive by. But it will be a fantastic experience for me too, driving along the Nordschleife in a state-of–the-art Formula 1 Silver Arrow, particularly in view of the fact that the Silver Arrow's legend began here. Posting a lap in a modern Silver Arrow on the most beautiful and most testing circuit in the world, what a brilliant mix – it's every motor racing driver's dream!"" formula one , mercedes , michael schumacher , nurburgring 24 , nurburgring nordschleife , nurburgring record , silver arrows *0 / 3000 Character Maximum I don't like getting nickeled and dimed as much as the next guy but since this prob won't be televised let alone available to view online I'd pay .99 for an app to watch it live/taped.

Michael is clearly fast but after all the practice session crashes in his career and crashes he's had in the last 2 seasons I wouldn't let him go for a record at, of all places, the ring.

Scroll down for a press release highlighting the automaker's future fuel-saving initiatives. VOLKSWAGEN PRESENTS FUTURE DRIVE SYSTEMS AT VIENNA SYMPOSIUM -Group Chairman announces 10-speed DSG and high-performance diesel engine -Plug-in hybrid most promising alternative drive system -Natural gas vehicles offer great potential for sustained mobility Vienna/Wolfsburg, 26 April 2013: Today at the 34th International Vienna Motor Symposium Prof. Dr. Martin Winterkorn, Chairman of the Board of Management of Volkswagen AG, gave a forecast of future drive system technologies. Areas of work being focussed on by Volkswagen include the development of a high-performance diesel engine delivering 100kW per litre of displacement and a new 10-speed dual clutch gearbox that reduces fuel consumption. Among the alternative drive systems plug-in hybrids in particular offer great potential. Winterkorn stressed that over the medium and long-term different drive system technologies would exist side by side. These would range from highly efficient internal combustion engines and natural gas systems all the way to hybrids and electric vehicles. On this basis the Volkswagen Group was working towards its declared objective of lowering the European new car fleet's CO2 emission level to 95g of CO2/km by 2020. Winterkorn emphasised that existing internal combustion engines still offer a lot of potential: 'Since the year 2000, we've reduced the fuel consumption of our TDI and TSI engines by more than 30 per cent. I'm convinced that by 2020 we can achieve further increases in efficiency of around 15 per cent.' Factors making this possible, he said, would include enhancement of the combustion process, intelligent lightweight design, innovative operating strategies and optimisation of friction levels and thermal management. Volkswagen also sees great potential for natural gas drive systems: 'The gas engine is environmentally friendly, economical and suitable for everyday use. The technology is fully developed and the vehicles are already on the market.' The best example is the new eco-up! - at 79g of CO2/km the world's most economical natural gas car. The Volkswagen Group will be systematically rolling out natural gas technology with the Golf TGI BlueMotion and the Audi A3 g-tron. Winterkorn: 'We need to make the public even more aware of the benefits of natural gas engines. Everyone needs to play their part in this: carmakers, politicians and the fuel industry.' The variety of drive system technologies is growing: the group-wide Volkswagen modular component system and its flexible architecture enable every kind of drive system to be integrated quickly into the new models. 'Over the coming years we will electrify all vehicle classes in this way and help electrically powered motoring to make the breakthrough,' added Winterkorn. In the medium term the first choice in terms of alternative drive systems is plug-in hybrid technology. This enables a purely electric range of up to 50 kilometres, a high level of suitability for everyday use by virtue of recharging from a socket at home and also complete flexibility for long journeys thanks to an efficient internal combustion engine. The Volkswagen Group's first plug-in hybrids, the Porsche Panamera and Audi A3 e-tron, will shortly be going into full production. They will be followed by the Golf and many other models, such as the Passat, Audi A6 and Porsche Cayenne. Volkswagen also presented at the symposium new technologies that are finding their way into the modular diesel component system's future engine generation. These high-performance diesel engines achieve peak power output of 100kW per litre of displacement and have a variable valve-train assembly, a high-pressure injection system at up to 3,000 bar and combined charging with the innovative e-booster.

Yesterday at 9:19 PM Report abuse Permalink It will be revolutionary if they actually get 134 hp/liter out of a production diesel. My interest is piqued. Yesterday at 7:44 PM Report abuse Permalink This is very interesting. The company that is striving to become #1 (and it already IS number one in some parameters) decided to put R&D money into more than 7-speed dual clutch transmission AND in 140 hp/liter diesel ... what does that tell you? To me, it tells me that proper car will not be built before they get a nice huge return from that investment - which is probably 15-20 years away from today. The proper car having NO transmission and using NO fuel to power 4 electric motors - one on each wheel. Wall St , you better take note. Elon, sorry for your luck.

I have a co-worker who brags about his Ford Freestyle (with ZF CVT) that now has almost 275,000 miles without any engine and transmission problems. Yesterday at 4:03 PM Report abuse Permalink Yes, and they announced a 3,500 NM car some time ago, which turned out to be a lie. They lied about their emissions, their sales, and covered a massive crash-test failure of the A4 in 2012. So allow me to be skeptical about what this main says. Yesterday at 3:26 PM Report abuse Permalink The 10 speed could be good for their ""offroad"" vehicles. Set the 3rd or 4th gear as ""1st"" for road driving and the lower ones could be used for as a sort of pseudo transfer case. High torque, low speed. Doubt it'll happen, i'm just thinking strange **** up. Yesterday at 11:22 AM Report abuse Permalink Yeah...that's work as well as my first Schwinn (geezer alert!) 10-speed. It had maybe three-four useful gears...the others were duplicates or so close that it didn't matter. Same with 27 speed bikes today....squirrely duplicative gears. A little work with a calculator and custom clusters can drop back to a thicker, more durable chain and 4-5 gears on the back and two at most up front...oops, back to 8-10 speeds. But make them wide-ratio. 10 speeds in a car just seems like a CVT with discernible shift points. And don't get me started on ZF transmission reliability and power handling capability or lack thereof. Yesterday at 9:47 AM Report abuse Permalink I think the car companies are engaged in transmission wars. Watch for a company like ZF to go ahead and introduce an 11 or 12 speed transmission, just because people will want to have it in their car to boast about. You have room to grow more gears in a RWD car, but you'd think they would run out of room for the FWD and AWD versions. Yesterday at 9:35 AM Report abuse Permalink 1 reply to strykerzzzz's comment Exactly. We had megapixel wars in cameras to the point when adding pixels (without increasing sensor physical size) lowered the photo quality. Phone screen sizes are making it impossible to operate them with one hand... But moron customers think that higher number is always better.... 22 hours ago Report abuse Permalink 10 speed DSG makes no sense for a possible ""self shifter"" like the R4. would only make sense for an automatic version imho Yesterday at 6:55 AM Report abuse Permalink Dinosaurs evolved to impressive proportions too.

"Must-know: Twitter stock has been hot, but is it a good deal? Twitter stock as appreciated rapidly since its recent IPO, but is it worth the price? Find out why we think Twitter is a bad deal. http://finance.yahoo.com/news/must-know-twitter-stock-hot-193451595.html Must-know: Twitter stock has been hot, but is it a good deal? - Yahoo Finance Must-know: Twitter stock has been hot, but is it a good deal? December 30, 2013 2:34 PM Why Twitter is like the cronut—in demand, but hyped and overvalued (Part 1 of 5) One of the buzziest topics in the investing world lately has been Twitter (TWTR). The social media company was one of the most sought-after IPOs of the year as the stock popped to $44.90 per share on its first trading day, after the IPO priced at $26 per share. Since then, the stock has had a strong rally and closed on December 20, 2013, at $63.75 per share, resulting in a market cap of over $36 billion. However, the market’s perception of Twitter’s valuation is far beyond the company’s fundamental valuation. We’re not saying the stock will decline in price, but we can say that where it’s priced is probably not what it’s worth, and that relative to its comps, Twitter is probably too expensive. Read on to find out why we think Twitter is a bad deal from both a relative and absolute value perspective. Continue to Part 2 Browse this series on Market Realist: Part 2 - What is Twitter?

(NYSE: JKS) and ... http://finance.yahoo.com/news/secondary-offerings-jinkosolar-shutterstock-send-161000001.html Secondary Offerings at JinkoSolar, Shutterstock Send Shares Higher - Yahoo Finance Secondary Offerings at JinkoSolar, Shutterstock Send Shares Higher September 20, 2013 12:10 PM It is not often that a secondary stock offering sends a company’s shares higher, but we are seeing that very phenomenon Friday morning. Chinese solar PV maker JinkoSolar Holding Co. Ltd. ( JKS ) and stock image company Shutterstock Inc. ( SSTK ) both priced secondary offerings this morning and shares in both companies have risen sharply. At JinkoSolar, shares priced at $16.25, after closing Thursday night at $16.48, and shortly before noon the stock was up by 13.8% at $18.75. The company offered 3.8 million shares and an underwriters’ option on an additional 570,000. JinkoSolar says it will use proceeds for general corporate purposes, which may include expanding its manufacturing capacity. That by itself should have sent shares down. ALSO READ: Famous Restaurant Chains That Are Hard to Find Shutterstock closed last night at $60.32 and priced its offering of 4.6 million shares at $60.00 this morning. The company is selling only 1 million shares; the rest are being sold by some existing shareholders. The underwriters have an option on an additional 690,000 shares. The company said the purpose behind the offering is to increase the company’s public float, among other things. As far as JinkoSolar is concerned, part of the reason for the price jump is almost certainly a short squeeze. Institutional investors also are likely the heaviest buyers as they move toward some momentum stocks to juice up returns. ALSO READ: The Countries with the Most Multimillionaires Shutterstock only had a public float of about 6.5 million shares, so it is likely adding liquidity. The stock is up more than 200% since the company’s IPO, and we can assume that there are real buyers out there who want in on the party. In addition, nearly 13% of the stock is held short, so there is some covering going on as well. Still, it is an interesting turn of events to see shares jump on secondary offerings. Shares of JinkoSolar are trading at $18.43 a few minutes after noon on Friday, in a 52-week range of $3.18 to $20.06. Shutterstock’s shares are up nearly 12% at $67.46, after posting a new 52-week high earlier this morning of $68.42. The 52-week low is the IPO price of $21.00.

We are seeing major ... http://finance.yahoo.com/news/companies-raising-over-3-billion-140056268.html Companies Raising Over $3 Billion in New Stock Sales - Yahoo Finance Companies Raising Over $3 Billion in New Stock Sales September 10, 2013 10:00 AM The stock market is looking healthier and healthier again, and it is not just because the S&P 500 is within striking distance of 1,700 and because the DJIA has crossed back over 15,000. We are seeing major secondary offerings from companies themselves and from their insiders and backers. When companies sell shares it is generally into a strong market. That being said, investors have to sometimes wonder if they want to buy stock when a company wants to sell more stock to the public. 24/7 Wall St. has tracked offerings from and involving the following companies: Armstrong World Industries Inc. ( AWI ); Enbridge Energy Management LLC ( EEQ ), Enbridge Energy Partners L.P. ( EEP ), Inergy Midstream L.P. ( NRGM ), Marketo Inc. ( MKTO ), Starwood Property Trust Inc. ( STWD ), Stratasys Ltd. ( SSYS ) and Virtus Investment Partners Inc. ( VRTS ). Ten Brands That Will Disappear in 2014 What should really stand out here is not just that these combined offerings come to more than $2.4 billion. We did not include several other offerings, and those in total would come up to close to another $1 billion. We have added color and reference on each offering versus its average volume and size. Armstrong World Industries Inc. ( AWI ) has an offering of 10,057,382 common shares held by Armstrong World Industries, Asbestos Personal Injury Settlement Trust and Armor TPG Holdings. Note that the company has agreed to purchase 5,057,382 of the 10,057,382 common shares of this offering at a price per share equal to the price paid by the underwriter. Shares are trading at $52.37, and the 52-week trading range is $43.30 to $58.48. This is some $520 million in gross dollars, or about $250 million if you back out the shares being repurchased. Seven Highly Educated Jobs Making the Least Money Enbridge Energy Management LLC ( EEQ ) has filed to sell 8 million of its listed shares (units). Proceeds will be used to invest in an equal number of i-units of Enbridge Energy Partners L.P. ( EEP ). Enbridge Partners will then use the proceeds to purchase additional shares to repay its commercial paper, to finance a portion of its capital expansion program and for general partnership purposes. The ""Management-EEQ"" units are down 4% at $28.67, against a 52-week range of $25.81 to $32.30. The ""Partners-EEP"" shares closed at $30.20, versus a 52-week range of $26.88 to $33.49. This comes to almost $240 million before the exercise of any overallotment shares (units). Inergy Midstream L.P. ( NRGM ) is trading down by 4.6%, at $22.19 against a 52-week range of $21.03 to $26.01, after filing to sell 11 million common units. The gross proceeds appear to be around $242 million or so. Be advised that the units are being sold by its limited partners. Marketo Inc. ( MKTO ) already has filed to sell 6 million shares of its common stock, with 5.3 million being sold by existing shareholders and Marketo offering about 700,000 shares in the offering. This offering may seem small at about $200 million, but this is right into a lock-up period since its IPO came out in May. Many investors find offerings in bad taste on a ""Sell as immediately as you can,"" but this one did very well since its IPO as well. Starwood Property Trust Inc. ( STWD ) has priced a 25 million share offering of common stock to raise just over $600 million in gross proceeds. The company intends to use the net proceeds to originate and purchase additional commercial mortgage loans and other target assets and investments, and it included the ""for other general corporate purposes"" disclaimer in the release. The $600 million compares to a market cap of about $4.04 billion, while the 25 million shares compares to an average daily volume of about 2 million shares. Apple: What Happens When Everyone Knows About a Product Release? Stratasys Ltd. ( SSYS ) is selling 4 million shares of its ordinary shares, representing close to $400 million in gross proceeds. Its market cap is just over $4 billion, and it trades about 825,000 shares per day on average. Virtus Investment Partners Inc. ( VRTS ) has done incredibly well as a stock, and it has now filed to sell roughly $175 million worth of its common stock. That would be roughly 1 million shares based on the current price, versus an average daily volume of only about 50,000 shares. Virtus has a market cap of $1.37 billion before the impact of this offering. These were just the offerings that we deemed to be of significant value. There were seven or eight other offerings that probably come close to another $1 billion or so in combined size. As a reminder, when companies and insiders sell more stock, those funds to purchase the new shares on the market generally are used in place of what would have otherwise been market-oriented stocks.

"We're Living in a 'Tech Depression': Andreessen Don't expect a game changing tech IPO anytime soon. Private tech companies are steering clear of going public as long as they can, said Marc Andreessen, the co-founder of the venture capital firm Andreessen ... http://finance.yahoo.com/news/were-living-tech-depression-andreessen-100130066.html We're Living in a 'Tech Depression': Andreessen - Yahoo Finance We're Living in a 'Tech Depression': Andreessen May 14, 2013 6:01 AM Don't expect a game changing tech initial public offering anytime soon. Private tech companies are steering clear of going public as long as they can manage, said Marc Andreessen, the co-founder of the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, on CNBC's ""Closing Bell"" Monday. ""When you say what's the next big IPO, the brutal truth is I don't know and I'm not sure there is going to be one for quite while because the incentives are so strong to keep these companies private,"" Andreessen said. : Software Out, Hardware Start-Ups In ) The hangover felt from the dot-com crash and financial crisis has spurred an era of over regulation in the public markets which has essentially caused a backlash from private companies that are refusing to go public, Andreessen said. Emerging entrepreneurs see the public markets as ""incredibly hostile,"" he said. ""The new running theory among new entrepreneurs is never take your company public or don't do it as long as you possibly can,"" Andreessen said. Andreessen, who has invested in tech companies including, Facebook ( FB ), Twitter, and Pinterest, said that another reason tech companies are hesitant to go public is because of the pain still felt from the dot-com crash. : Facebook in Talks to Buy Israel's Waze: Report ) ""A lot of people got burned during the dot-com crash, so I think we are living through the other side of that, I think we are living through sort of the tech depression, is the term I've used,"" he said. ""But at the same time I can tell you that the vast majority of the interesting new companies that are sort of at the $50 million to $100 million revenue stage,that have historically have been the source of the exciting IPOs that put growth into the market, those companies are quite simply staying private, they aren't going public."" : Signs of Another Tech Bubble: VC ) While there were about 8,800 public companies in 1997, there were about 4,100 publicly traded companies in 2012, a decline that can be contributed to a war being waged on the public markets via regulations like Sarbanes-Oaxley and Regulation FD, which were put in place to help derisk the market. But these regulations do more harm than good, Andreessen said. (Read More Below the Video.) ""We seem to have collectively decided as a society that we want to strip risks out of the public markets, so we had the dot-com crash, we had the financial crisis, and we decided that we don't like risk anymore,"" he said. ""So there have been a series of regulatory reforms, a series of corporate governance movements, and the result has been a huge disincentive for companies to go public, and of course the problem with that is if new companies don't go public then you get exactly what we are seeing, which is the number of public companies falling."" Because the number of public companies is falling, growth is being stripped out of the public markets, which will ultimately pave the way for a two-tiered system, he said. ""If you kill risk, you kill growth. If you kill growth you kill returns. And as a result the market is becoming a two-tiered system and I think that is bad,"" he said. ""Funds like ours-that primarily represent, frankly, rich people, rich people's pensions, rich people's colleges and foreign countries' sovereign wealth funds-generally, are doing fine."" However, he said that on the public side, growth is being drained out of the market, and that could hurt many Americans in the long-term. ""Of course the public market is where most ordinary Americans retirement savings is held in the form of mutual funds and pension funds and if we keep with this approach of over regulation in the public markets, we're not going to have returns for peoples' retirement accounts, which means people aren't going to be able to retire,"" he said. ""And I think that is going to be the big problem that comes out of that and I think that's where we are heading straight towards that right now.""

According to the territory’s South China Morning Post, China’s largest e-commerce company, Alibaba Group, is discussing Nasdaq (paywall) as ... http://finance.yahoo.com/news/alibaba-may-choose-york-over-051625803.html Alibaba may choose New York over Hong Kong for its hotly anticipated IPO - Yahoo Finance Alibaba may choose New York over Hong Kong for its hotly anticipated IPO March 7, 2013 12:16 AM Will Hong Kong lose out on a hotly anticipated jumbo Chinese IPO? According to the territory’s South China Morning Post, China’s largest e-commerce company, Alibaba Group, is discussing Nasdaq (paywall) as the venue for its long-awaited listing. An IPO could value Alibaba at  more than $40 billion , making it potentially the biggest tech IPO in history . If the company chooses a US listing, that would be a further blow to the Chinese territory, where the value of IPOs on the stock exchange plummeted to a four year low last year as mainland China’s economic slowdown made investors less interested in allocating cash there. Chinese internet firms have a long record of choosing the Nasdaq over Hong Kong, mainly because they tend to be fast-growing but also young and loss-making.  The Hong Kong stock exchange requires companies conducting IPOs to have earned a profit for three years before going public. But Alibaba  is profitable  (its part-owner Yahoo discloses its finances).  So it would not be forced to choose a US exchange over Hong Kong in the way that Chinese  social networking business Renren , for example, had to. However, it would be not be unusual if Alibaba were meeting with banks and stock exchange representatives in Hong Kong and New York to see where it would get the best valuation for its shares. Investment bankers in both cities have been crowding around the company and trying to get hired on the IPO. It was reported  (paywall) last month that Alibaba executives were set to meet potential advisers to discuss a Hong Kong listing. Alibaba Group includes Alibaba.com, an online marketplace connecting Chinese manufacturers with overseas buyers, and auction site Taobao. Alibaba.com was previously listed on the Hong Kong exchange. It was taken private by Alibaba Group founder Jack Ma last year in a move widely viewed as a precursor to an IPO of his entire business. An Alibaba Group spokesman declined to comment.

"Professional Diversity Network IPO Struggles Professional Diversity Network¡rsquo;s (NASDAQ: IPDN) IPO fell flat in its market debut yesterday, getting the March initial public offerings market off to an inauspicious start. http://finance.yahoo.com/news/professional-diversity-network-ipo-struggles-195953813.html Professional Diversity Network IPO Struggles - Yahoo Finance Professional Diversity Network IPO Struggles March 6, 2013 2:59 PM Professional Diversity Network’s ( IPDN ) IPO fell flat in its market debut yesterday, getting the March initial public offerings market off to an inauspicious start. The first stock to go public on a U.S. market in nearly three weeks, the Professional Diversity Network IPO declined 4% in its first day of trading and is down another 5.6% today. That doesn’t bode well for the provider of online networking and job opportunities for minorities, which went public below its expected range at $8 a share. It was also a lukewarm kickoff for the March IPO market on the heels of a busy first two months of 2013 . Twelve companies went public in January – the most since 2006. February brought another eight IPOs – less than the last two Februarys, but more than the previous three. The returns have been even better. Year-to-date, the 21 companies that have gone public have returned an average of more than 15%. Only five of them have actually fallen since their debuts – another bad sign for Professional Diversity Network. Up next on the IPO schedule are Artisan Partners Asset Management , a Wisconsin-based investment management business, and Silver Spring Networks , which provides smart grid products and services. According to IPO web site Renaissance Capital, no other public offerings are in the hopper – which could bode for a slower March than in recent years.

And a common point analysts raised just before its 2011 IPO was that Glencore’s majority shareholders may be selling out because they predicted the world resources “supercycle,” as commodities bulls used to call it, was about to be punctured. Glencore’s 2o12 earnings, released today, will have its IPO cynics chuckling at the prescience of their foresight. Last year, Glencore’s net income  crashed 75% . That was partly because of a decline in the value of Glencore’s stake in Russian aluminum producer Rusal, but generally because its sales prices declined as  China’s growth slowed . While the London and Hong Kong flotation  made billionaires of Glencore’s bosses, it’s not at all provable that CEO Ivan Glasenberg saw into the future with mystic accuracy before selling part of his company to outsiders. Maybe he just wanted to spread the fruits of his company’s success more widely and was as surprised by the supercycle accident as many others in the resources industry  (paywall). Still, the IPO timing looks brilliant for those who swapped large stakes in the business for cash. Here is what has happened to Glencore’s London share price (blue line) since its stockmarket debut and with the overall performance of the FTSE 100 (yellow line) provided for reference. Ouch.

"Facebook hits new low as IPO lock-up ends Facebook's stock plunged to a new low Thursday as some of the social networking leader's early backers got their first chance to sell their shares since the company's initial public offering went awry.Analysts ... http://finance.yahoo.com/news/facebook-hits-low-ipo-lock-143200785.html Facebook hits new low as IPO lock-up ends - Yahoo Finance Facebook hits new low as IPO lock-up ends Facebook shares hit new depths as lock-up period ends, providing early investors with an out By Barbara Ortutay and Michael Liedtke, AP Technology Writers August 16, 2012 6:54 PM SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Facebook's stock plunged to a new low Thursday as some of the social networking leader's early backers got their first chance to sell their shares since the company's initial public offering went awry. Analysts interpreted the unusually high trading volume as a clear sign that at least a few of the insiders were seizing on a fresh selling opportunity. That is stirring a debate over whether they're simply locking in long-awaited gains on investments made many years ago or bailing out of a company that has lost its luster. A breakdown on just how many major Facebook Inc. shareholders sold their stock probably won't be available until next week at the earliest. Securities regulations give them at least three business days before they have to disclose such transactions. The information is important ""because if you are an investor who has been sitting on the sidelines waiting for a good time to buy the stock, you might decide to stay on the sidelines for a little longer after seeing which insiders decided to sell their stock,"" CapStone Investments analyst Rory Maher said. All told, investors who owned a combined 271 million Facebook shares could have sold their holdings Thursday with the expiration of a ban known as a lock-up period. The restrictions were imposed on a group of venture capitalists, companies and Silicon Valley cognoscente who invested in Facebook during its formative years and sold some of their holdings three months ago when the company went public at $38. The highly anticipated IPO had valued the company at $104 billion, similar to those of Amazon.com Inc. and PepsiCo Inc. The shares have plunged by nearly 50 percent since then amid concerns about whether Facebook is destined to become a passing fancy and worries about whether it will be able to sell more advertising on mobile devices as users gravitate there. Facebook' stock traded as low as $19.69 before bouncing back slightly. The shares closed Thursday at $19.87, down $1.33, or more than 6 percent. The previous low during the day was $19.82 and the previous low for a close was $20.04, both reached Aug. 2 More than 156 million shares were traded, more than five times the stock's average volume over the past month. Trading in the overall market was lighter than usual. The Facebook investors eligible to sell their shares Thursday included venture capital firms Accel Partners and Greylock Partners; investment banker Goldman Sachs Group; software maker Microsoft Corp.; Zynga Inc. CEO Marc Pincus; LinkedIn Corp. Chairman Reid Hoffman; and former PayPal CEO Peter Thiel. If there was mass selling within this group, Facebook's stock could decline further because the market would be flooded with nearly two-thirds more shares. Given that most of these investors put their money into Facebook five to eight years ago, they probably were eager to sell, said Sam Hamadeh, the CEO of PrivCo, a research firm that follows privately held companies. ""A lot of people have been waiting,"" he said. ""Facebook was expected to go public a long time ago."" Despite the sharp drop in Facebook's market value during the past three months, the early investors can still reap huge windfalls by selling at the current price. For instance, Thiel invested $500,000 in Facebook in 2004, the year CEO Mark Zuckerberg began the site in a Harvard dorm room. After selling 16.8 million shares for $640 million at the time of the initial public offering in May, Thiel still owned nearly 28 million shares worth about $560 million at Thursday's trading prices. Accel Partners invested $12.7 million in Facebook in 2005. The firm sold nearly 58 million shares for $2.2 billion as part of Facebook's IPO and still owned nearly 144 million shares worth about $2.9 billion. It wasn't known how many of those shares could have been sold Thursday, and whether any of them were. Because those investors had put up little compared with the shares' value today, ""you can understand why they would want to take some of their money off the table now,"" Maher said. ""But at the same time, you have to wonder if they're thinking that Facebook isn't much of a bargain anymore."" Hamadeh believes the venture capitalists who invested in Facebook realize it's a ""fool's game"" to wait for a better price on the stock. On the flip side, other key investors seem unlikely to sell additional shares right away. Microsoft, which invested $240 million in Facebook in 2007, relies on Facebook's social network to help bring more traffic to its Bing search engine, making it less likely that it would risk antagonizing Facebook executives by bailing out. The software company also doesn't need the money, as it is already is sitting on $63 billion in cash. A Microsoft spokesman declined to comment Thursday. The selling shackles will come off of an additional 1.66 billion locked-up Facebook shares during the next nine months to place more potential pressure on the stock. One of the biggest tests will come in November when about 1.2 billion insider shares will be eligible for sale. The freed-up shares will include those owned by Zuckerberg, the Facebook CEO and founder who sold 30 million shares for $1.1 billion in the May IPO to cover his taxes. Other Internet companies that have gone public in the past year have been hit hard by the expiration of their lock-up periods. On Tuesday, shares of online reviews service Angie's List suffered their biggest one-day drop so far and closed at a new low following the expiration of a similar ban. The price dropped, even though there was no word on whether any of the major investors had dumped their shares. LinkedIn, which runs a professional networking version of Facebook, also took a big hit when restrictions on insider selling lifted last November. Its shares sank to their trading low of $55.98 after the lock-up period expired, but have since rebounded strongly. The shares closed at $103.99 Thursday, more than twice its IPO price of $45. It appears some investors believe Facebook's stock price is nearing its low point, at least until the next lock-up periods end this fall. Short sellers, a type of investor that bets certain stocks will fall, had been intensifying their focus on Facebook since the company's July 26 report of disappointing revenue growth during the second quarter. To wager against a company, short sellers must borrow the stock of other investors and then make money by paying back the shares at a lower price. The amount of borrowed Facebook shares had spiked from about 70 million before Facebook's second-quarter earnings report to about 92 million at the end of Thursday's trading, said Tim Smith, senior vice president of SunGard Astecs Analytics, which tracks short-selling activity. But sentiments started to shift Thursday as the volume of shares being returned to the lenders outstripped the number being borrowed, Smith said. The cost to borrow Facebook shares also has been declining, a sign that short-selling demand is waning. ""Facebook's stock might be finally bumping along its bottom,"" Smith said. Considering the heavy trading volume, Facebook's stock would have fallen more dramatically if buyers hadn't stepped in, said Louise Yamada, a technical analyst who runs her own research firm. She suspects Facebook insiders are being careful not to flood the market with stock. ""They're smart enough to know if they sell at the same time, the stock would fall,"" Yamada said. It has been a rough run for Facebook. After one of the most-anticipated IPOs in history, Facebook had perhaps the most-botched stock market debut as glitches marred its first day of trading. Things have gotten progressively worse as Facebook's market value has plunged by about $49 billion. The downfall stems from doubts about Facebook's ability to fend off intensifying competition from Internet search leader Google Inc. while trying to develop a plan for increasing the amount of revenue that it brings in from a worldwide audience of 955 million users. The uncertainty means Facebook's stock is likely to be volatile until the end of the year when the majority of the lockups expire. Hamadeh views the end of those selling constraints as a ""dark cloud on the horizon."" ""There is no way around it. It'll be painful,"" he said. ""But hopefully once that selling pressure is gone, it will find its floor and could be a basis for a more stable stock through 2013."" __ AP Business Writer Bernard Condon in New York contributed to this story.

Until we stop all immigration from Muslim countries, events like this will continue to happen daily. Of course, the communists (liberals) like Obama fully support these scumbags. These people, combined with the 47% urban leeches, are the Democratic voting base. The growing threat of Islam is coming from within, and if we don't put a stop to it, soon we will find ourselves under a communist Marxist Islamic Jihadist rule (which is Obama's plan) soon. The Democrats have always been the party which supports extremist Islam. The fact that they ended the Iraq war (hich we began against an extremist Muslim dictator who supported the 9/11 terrorists who planned to use WMDs on America) proves that they support this communist Islamic agenda. They also HATE Israel, and want to wipe it and it's people off the map, andreplace it with ""Palestine"". They have the audacity to support a MOSQUE at ground 0, and now they are whining about the ""Miranda rights"" of this terrorist. Until we vote for a REAL conservative like Bachmann, Santorum, Rubio, or West, America will continue to die and be replaced by a communist Muslim stye.

At its peak, the stock traded at nearly $600, versus around $500 now. With earnings expected after the close Thursday, investors will be looking for any sign that the mounting controversy and legal issues over the injuries and deaths allegedly related to da Vinci procedures are affecting the company's growth. (Read More Below the Video.) : What Happens When the Surgical Robot Malfunctions? ) Over the past two quarters, growth in sales and profits slowed considerably, but it is still robust by most standards, with sales in the fourth quarter leaping 23 percent. Driving gains has been growing use of the da Vinci for hysterectomies and other gynecological procedures. Forecasts for this quarter are for earnings per share of 43 cents on revenue of $282 million. But as more reports of complications have come to light, the da Vinci debate is heating up. In late February, the FDA launched a probe calling for voluntary information from hospitals and surgeons using the da Vinci, in an effort to determine ""if the rise in reports may be a true reflection of problems."" Speaking at an investor meeting in early March, the company said, ""The relationship we have with the FDA has been a long and very strong relationship."" In mid-March the American Congress of Obstetricians and and Gynecologists issued a statement, warning that ""studies show there is a learning curve with new surgical technologies, during which there is an increased complication rate."" Robotic Surgery: Growing Sales, but Growing Concerns ) And five days later, the Massachusetts Board of Registration in Medicine weighed in with an advisory citing an ""increasing number of reports of patient complications associated with robot-assisted surgery."" In a statement to CNBC, Intuitive said: ""In any definitive treatment for complex disease, such as surgery of the cancerous prostate, heart, or other major organs there are risks of complications. Robotic surgery has proven benefits in reducing the risk and complications associated with open surgical procedures thereby extending the benefits of minimally invasive surgery to a broader population of patients. Overall, adverse event rates are very low. Da Vinci surgery has been shown to be safer than the open surgery alternatives in numerous independent large scale, peer reviewed studies.""

"A Big Week for IPOs, and More Are Coming It's a big week for initial public offerings, and more are coming. Finally, it looks like IPOs are starting to catch up with the market. http://finance.yahoo.com/news/big-week-ipos-more-coming-142923777.html A Big Week for IPOs, and More Are Coming - Yahoo Finance A Big Week for IPOs, and More Are Coming April 12, 2013 10:29 AM Traders work on the floor at the New York Stock Exchange, April 11, 2013. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid It's a big week for initial public offerings, and more are coming. Finally, it looks like IPOs are starting to catch up with the market. This was a big week for IPOs, in terms of number and how well most of them did. Six companies went public this week, and about $1.5 billion was raised. Four of the six increased the number of shares offered, or priced above the expected range, or both. That is bullish. You don't see this type of activity in a bear market. For the first quarter about $7.8 billion was raised, according to John Fitzgibbon at IPO Scoop. That is much better than the first quarter of 2012, when $5.9 billion was raised. The IPO market is a follower, not a leader ... but it's catching up. And there are more coming. Seven IPOs are on tap for next week, looking to raise $1.9 billion. Another big one was just announced: HD Supply Holdings (12 percent owned by Home Depot) filed for a large ($1 billion) IPO. The company went private for $8.5 billion in 2007. (More From CNBC: Cramer Says Wells Fargo Missed a 'Great Mortgage Moment' ) Two IPOs priced overnight: Payment processing company Evertec (to be traded under the symbol ""EVTC"") priced 25.3 million shares at $20, the high end of the price range of $18 to $20 a share, while Rally Software (""RALY"") priced 6 million shares $14. That is above the initial share count of 5.75 million and above the price talk of $11 to $13 a share. Rally provides cloud-based systems for Agile software development projects, which is a methodology for best practices in developing software. 1) JPMorgan Chase: Poke all the holes you want. It continues to hit the numbers, and it's got a ton of money. The usual pundits are coming on, complaining about ""earnings quality."" They do this every quarter. You can say it's making its numbers because it is releasing reserves, you can say it's because it is cutting costs, but still. JPMorgan is making its numbers. Yes, low rates hurt margins, but we've seen that for three years and guys are still finding ways to make money. It is also planning to raise its dividend...it now has a 3.2 percent dividend yield, and is continuing to buy back stock. (More From CNBC: 5 Fiscal Secrets Buried Deep in Obama's Budget ) JPMorgan current earnings estimate for 2013 is about $5.50 a share; it could do $6 a share. That's 8.3 times earnings, with a 3.2 percent dividend. That's not awful. JPMorgan has something like $21 billion in reserves it can release. It can buy back stock, increase its dividend, and still get to 9 percent Tier One capital. And if there is any hint that rates are going to go up, this company will explode. 2) Everyone's getting bearish! What's up with sentiment? Lots of talk last night about the huge plunge in bullish sentiment for the weekly AAII Investor Sentiment Survey. Bullish sentiment is at 19.3 percent for the week ending April 10, down 16.2 points from the prior week, the lowest level since March 5, 2009. Wow. The historic average is 39 percent. Bearish sentiment went to 54.5 percent, up 26.3 points from the prior week, the highest pessimism level since July 8, 2010. Some are noting that there was an unusually low level of respondents this week ... maybe the bears are just more motivated! 3) Finally, a downgrade of two big consumer names. It's been quite a ride for big consumer names this year. Coca-Cola has gone from $36 to $41 a share, PepsiCo has gone from $68 to $80 a share this year and is at an historic high. Today Davenport downgraded both to ""neutral"" on valuation, but also noted that for Coca-Cola was likely ""weaker than expected."" It certainly is a bit of a mystery why these stocks have been flying: Coke had only 1 percent volume growth in the fourth quarter of 2012 and is trading at roughly 19 times forward earnings. Pepsi is trading at 18 times forward earnings. 3) Gold collapses, breaking to near 12-month lows.

"Model N, Tetraphase IPOs Debut Two IPOs hit the market today ¡ndash; with two very different first-day performances. http://finance.yahoo.com/news/model-n-tetraphase-ipos-debut-205808421.html Model N, Tetraphase IPOs Debut - Yahoo Finance Model N, Tetraphase IPOs Debut March 20, 2013 4:58 PM Two IPOs hit the market today – with two very different first-day performances. Model N ( MODN ) , a provider of revenue management software to the life science and technology sectors, was up 28% in its debut despite pricing above its expected range. The stock went public at $15.50 a share, ahead of its predicted $12.50-$14.50 range. But that didn’t stop it from rising all the way to $19.84 on Wednesday. Tetraphase Pharmaceutical’s ( TTPH ) IPO wasn’t quite as effective. A developer of antibiotics that treat serious abdominal and urinary tract infections, Tetraphase shares priced at $7 a share – well below the $10 to $12 range listed in the company’s original IPO filing. The stock didn’t budge from there, finishing at exactly $7 after rising as high as $7.50. Six more companies are scheduled to go public in the coming days, including another pharmaceutical company called Enanta. Tetraphase’s first-day struggles likely have Enanta officials a bit more apprehensive about their company’s IPO. On the flip side, Marin Software is surely encouraged by Model N’s smashing debut. That should embolden the San Francisco-based cloud-computing company ahead of its IPO, which could come by week’s end. Model N and Tetraphase were just the fourth and fifth companies to go public this month. More From Wyatt Investment Research Fed Meeting By the Numbers How is March Madness Useful in Investing?

And there are several reasons why 360buy should in fact wait even longer. While  IPO rumors have come and gone , the latest reason for the speculation is the  similar chatter about Alibaba Group , China’s largest e-commerce company and 360buy’s biggest rival. (Alibaba’s TMall is thought to have some 45% of the business-to-consumer (B2C) market share , compared with 360buy’s 17%.) Some say an imminent Alibaba listing puts pressure on 360buy  to move first in order to beat Alibaba to the punch. But investors in an IPO will ask whether 360buy can make a real profit, and some analysts doubt it.  360buy follows an Amazon model when it comes to logistics and, as a result, it is burning through cash to expand its capacity in deliveries, warehousing and inventory. Furthermore, many of its products are low-margin electronic goods. That pits it against Suning Appliance, a brick-and-mortar retailer listed in Shanghai which is breaking into e-commerce, and is planning to  spend $3.5 billion on ramping up . Alibaba follows a different model—one that’s high-margin and low-cost. That means apple-to-apple comparisons with 360buy aren’t entirely appropriate. Alibaba’s TMall is a collection of thousands of virtual stores for brands like Prada, Gucci, Gap and, as of yesterday, Microsoft . Those stores handle the deliveries, which means Alibaba doesn’t rack up high capital costs; the company doubled its net income to $273 million in the second quarter of last year. As a result, for Alibaba an IPO is logical for funding its growth. The company may go public in the fourth quarter this year, though no decisions have been made, according to sources. Where 360buy sees TMall’s Achilles heel, the source told Quartz, is in logistics. TMall doesn’t handle deliveries, so it’s unusually vulnerable to bottlenecks in China’s backward parcel delivery system. It recently formed a coalition with delivery and real estate companies to help get around this. 360buy wants to invest in warehousing and logistics to give itself a competitive edge, the source said. Last month 360buy raked in $700 million in its latest fundraising round—enough cash to make the final push toward profitability and making a public listing a medium-term goal, the industry source said. CEO Richard Liu said he expects to be  profitable only in 2014  (link in Chinese), though the source said that could happen as soon as the end of 2013. But most of that $700 million will go into building up its logistics, putting further pressure on its already low-margin business and making an IPO premature.  Another sign that it’s too early for 360buy to consider listing is that valuation estimates have been in flux, when they normally go steadily up for a company in pre-public mode. All this suggests 360buy isn’t ready to start unveiling its financials, much less go on a road show to pitch the company. If it sells itself too early to investors, it risks having its IPO become a flop. Even if Alibaba beats it to going public, 360buy is better off waiting to solidify its business first.

The company had waited a long time before going public (it filed its initial paperwork in 2011) and green tech stocks haven’t been embraced by the market. But when the IPO finally came,  the stock jumped by almost 30% after its debut, showing a successful IPO is just as much about art as it is science. The IPO market has been rife with cautionary tales lately, leading some to question the mechanisms used to price and assess demand. Some like Facebook  seem overpriced and then drop in the market after going public, while others like LinkedIn jump so much that underwriters are accused of underpricing the IPO. The New York Times recently argued that Goldman Sachs severely underpriced  the 1999 eToys IPO —though others argued it was overpriced given the fundamentals of eToys, which later went out of business. Unfortunately, there is no magic formula for setting an IPO. The science—the numbers for revenue, customers and profitability—is important, helping establish an IPO’s timing and the share price range. But then comes the art, which is in the form of the IPO road show. This is when the company and its underwriters tell their story, in addition to assessing investor appetite and concerns. Facebook did a bad job of both. During the road show, some investors expressed concerns about the company’s future growth, especially because Facebook released some negative information about its mobile advertising during that time. Instead of taking investors’ worries as a hint to be more conservative on the IPO, Facebook and its lead underwriter went the other way. For Silver Spring, the company and its underwriters, Goldman Sachs and Credit Suisse, knew they had to explain to investors why they waited so long to go public, according to sources. But they also talked about the company’s growth prospects, including in places like South America and Asia, and other promising data, the sources said. And they made the pitch to the kinds of investors who understand Silver Spring’s niche business. Silver Spring also wanted the stock to go up by a reasonable amount after it debuted, sources added; this “pop” has psychological value. So the pricing was relatively conservative. But after getting signs of interest from investors, Silver Spring increased the quantity of shares it would sell, albeit not by too much; and it didn’t alter the $17 price. It remains to be seen whether Silver Spring can sustain its IPO bump. But it was trading just above $22 in its second day on the market. And an IPO that had its naysayers is now being seen as a positive sign for  investors in green energy technology, and in the tech market in general.

"The Valuation Guru Who Nailed Apple Reveals Facebook's Fair Price He also predicted how Facebook would IPO. http://finance.yahoo.com/news/valuation-guru-nailed-apple-reveals-144217092.html The Valuation Guru Who Nailed Apple Reveals Facebook's Fair Price - Yahoo Finance The Valuation Guru Who Nailed Apple Reveals Facebook's Fair Price May 23, 2012 10:42 AM Aswath Damodaran, NYU's legendary finance professor, has made two monster calls in recent weeks: 1) He sold Apple near the top after holding it for 15 years. 2) He said Facebook would be a "" Goldilocks IPO ""—not too hot, not too cold. That latter call may still be up for debate.  But the bottom line is that it neither surged, nor totally collapsed. In a new guest post on Forbes.com , Damodaran offers a valuation for Facebook: .  That gives the social network a market capitalization of about $70 billion. ""Yes, Facebook can be valued,"" he wrote. Here are the assumptions and caveats he employs in his valuation model: : ""...If the company can maintain a compounded revenue growth of 40% for the next 5 years , with growth rates scaling down after that towards the growth rate of the economy, the firm will have revenues of $44 billion in ten years, which would put it on the same growth path as Google in its first years as a public company."" : ""...If Facebook is able to maintain a (close to Apple’s, and higher than Google’s) as a mature company, it would be pulling off a very difficult feat."" : ""As Facebook’s revenue grows, it will find itself under pressure to pay more for this growth ..."" : ""There is significant risk in the company. In valuing the company,  we use a cost of capital of 11.42% , which would put Facebook in the top quartile of publicly traded U.S. firms in terms of risk."" Damodaran, being a value investor isn't ready to buy. ""With its user base, Facebook has the ingredients to generate sizable profits down the road, albeit with substantial risks along the way,"" he wrote.  ""At the right price, I would buy the company, notwithstanding the uncertainty about the future. At the IPO offering price or even at the price at which it is trading at right now, I would not."" Read the whole post at Forbes.com .

A few thoughts: IPOs can be hit or miss. On the ... http://finance.yahoo.com/news/lessons-facebook-ipo-130719545.html Some Lessons From the Facebook IPO - Yahoo Finance Some Lessons From the Facebook IPO May 23, 2012 9:07 AM I have no idea whether Facebook stock will ultimately pan out to be a solid investment. In the short term, the stock is in the red following its IPO debut. A few thoughts: IPOs can be hit or miss. On the plus side, Google debuted in August of 2004 at $85 per share and currently trades at just over $602 per share, a handsome return for longer-term shareholders. The stock peaked at over $700 per share in late 2007 and fell to under $300 per share by late 2008 during the market meltdown. The other side of this coin, at least so far, is Groupon. The company's shares debuted in November of last year at $20 per share, hit a high of just over $31, and currently trade at just under $12 per share. The company's business model and accounting practices have come under question in recent months. Individual stocks can carry great rewards and great risks. I do not deal with individual stocks on behalf of my clients, with the exception of those clients who receive company stock as part of their compensation or those clients who brought individual stock holdings with them when they became clients. Asset allocation and risk control via mutual funds and ETFs works very well for my client base. That said, there is no combination of funds and ETFs that would have provided a return anywhere near what Apple stock has over the past decade plus. However, for every Apple or Google, there is a Microsoft or General Electric. The latter two companies' stock has basically been dead money for the past ten years. Both companies have failed to beat the anemic performance of the S&P 500 Index over the past decade. Microsoft was once itself a high flier. Its stock price broke $10 per share in 1996 and rose to over $58 during 1999. The stock has languished in the $20s for most of the period since 2000, with a few brief exceptions. Individual holdings can also be subject to event risk. An example of this was Union Carbide (now a subsidiary of Dow Chemical) after the disastrous chemical leak in Bhopal, India in 1984. The stock price dropped sharply in the wake of this tragedy. BP's stock was almost $78 per share in late 2007, but it fell to below $30 per share in the wake of the Gulf oil spill. The stock has recovered a bit and currently hovers near $40 per share, but this is still well off of its high. Many investors have no sell discipline. Finding a good price at which to buy an individual stock is much easier than determining when to sell it. Worse yet, I've seen too many investors who refuse to sell a stock in which they have a loss until they break even. Successful investors have sell discipline. Whether you invest in individual stocks and bonds, mutual funds, ETFs, or a combination of these, some basic investing principles should apply: --Invest with a goal in mind, ideally as part of your overall financial plan. -- Diversification is important. -- Control risk . --Rebalance periodically. --Review and monitor your individual holdings. While all of the hype over IPOs like Facebook's is interesting, it should be largely irrelevant to most investors. , CFP®, is a fee-only financial adviser at Asset Strategy Consultants based in Arlington Heights, Ill., where he provides advice to individual clients, retirement plan sponsors, foundations, and endowments.

Stock sinks on 2nd day Facebook stock down nearly 7 percent as it opens for 2nd day of trading as public company May 21, 2012 9:34 AM NEW YORK (AP) -- Facebook's stock is sinking nearly 7 percent, falling below the $38 IPO price, in the social network's second day of trading as a public company Monday. Investors and technology industry watchers are closely tracking the Menlo Park, Calif., company's shares. The world's largest social network was one of the most anticipated initial public stock offerings ever, and now serves as a bellwether for other social media companies. Facebook's market debut Friday suffered some hiccups, with trading on the Nasdaq delayed for a half hour and issues with traders' orders. The stock closed Friday just 23 cents above where it priced Thursday night, when many investors had hoped for a big first-day pop. Facebook Inc.'s stock is down $2.62 to $35.61 on Monday.

But it has already set a strong example for entrepreneurs who want to build their companies into influential ... http://finance.yahoo.com/news/one-lesson-facebook-ipo-zuckerberg-213447023.html One Lesson From Facebook IPO: Like Zuckerberg, Rule Yourself - Yahoo Finance One Lesson From Facebook IPO: Like Zuckerberg, Rule Yourself May 15, 2012 5:34 PM Facebook may or may not juice the market for promising young companies hoping to go public. But it has already set a strong example for entrepreneurs who want to build their companies into influential game-changers instead of taking a safer route--selling out to a competitor or a goliath. [ Photo gallery: A Look Back at Kodak. ] Even after it goes public and must, theoretically, answer to shareholders, Facebook and its 28-year-old CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, will retain an unusual level of autonomy. The public offering has been structured so that Zuckerberg himself will retain enough voting power to make unilateral decisions, if he chooses to--as he apparently did when single-handedly negotiating the recent $1 billion purchase of Instagram. Few company founders, if any, get such an influx of new capital while retaining so much control over their firms. That could end up being a risky business strategy, but for now, it's heartening to entrepreneurs eager to stick with their firms for the long haul. Since the recession hit in 2008, skittish lenders and weak financial markets have depressed the market for initial public offerings and forced many promising startups into the arms of healthier acquirers. Pure Digital, which made the popular Flip video camera, was acquired in 2009 by Cisco--which shut down the Flipcam operation just two years later. Personal-finance startup Mint.com was purchased by Intuit and rolled into its broader lineup of productivity offerings. Google bought Zagat and more than 50 lesser-known companies over the last three years, merging many of them into its existing platform of offerings. [ See why Mark Zuckerberg might be too successful. ] There's nothing wrong with selling your company to a corporate giant, especially if you're an entrepreneur who's eager to do something else or who simply wants the big payday. But acquired companies often lose their mission and sometimes their entire identity. Instead of growing into independent companies that hire people, build a following, and make an impact, they become indistinct parts of a corporate bureaucracy. Some analysts feel the trend toward ""flipping"" companies can erode the self-reinforcing culture of entrepreneurship in places like Silicon Valley, where startups often rely on the cultivation of others who have built their own firms into powerhouses. ""If you create a mercenary culture, it will kill the goose that laid the golden egg,"" says Andy Rachleff, a former venture capitalist who's now CEO of personal-finance startup Wealthfront.com. ""You solve little incremental things, but they don't make much of an impact on society."" Rachleff says entrepreneurs start new companies for three basic reasons: to make a lot of money, to build a great enterprise, or to change the world. Those goals aren't mutually exclusive, obviously, but Zuckerberg has made it clear that his primary intent with Facebook is to change the world (even if he gets rather rich in the process). [ See where the jobs are, and the college grads aren't. ] In an open letter contained in the official registration documents filed with the government, Zuckerberg stated that ""Facebook was not originally created to be a company. It was built to accomplish a social mission--to make the world more open and connected."" He then went on to explain how its entire business strategy is built around that goal--whether shareholders like it or not. Other startup CEOs can only wish they had the standing to dictate terms to their investors, since lenders are firmly in the driver's seat these days. After peaking in 2007, the number of U.S. IPOs plunged in 2008 and 2009, according to consulting firm Pricewaterhouse Coopers. The IPO market recovered somewhat in 2010, then fell back in 2011. This year, it's on a pace to eclipse last year's activity, but it's still about 30 percent below the pace of deals in 2007. ""It's starting to look normal,"" says Henri Leveque, a partner at PwC. ""We're seeing enough of these to feel good about people's confidence in capital markets."" If the Facebook offering goes well, it could generate more enthusiasm for other IPOs believed to be in the works, involving companies such as Airbnb, Dropbox, LivingSocial, Pinterest, Spotify, Twitter, and Workday. One thing many young firms have going for them these days: They've come of age in a tough economy, which means they're pretty durable. ""Recent IPOs have had solid management teams or sophisticated financial sponsorship,"" says Leveque. ""They're real companies."" Maybe some of them will even stick around for a while. ick Newman is the author of Rebounders: How Winners Pivot From Setback to Success. Follow him on Twitter: @rickjnewman.

But Mark Zuckerberg is no boy-CEO.Facebook's chief executive turned 28 on Monday, setting in motion ... http://finance.yahoo.com/news/facebook-ceo-turns-28-ipo-192840442.html Facebook CEO turns 28, IPO could be $100B gift - Yahoo Finance Facebook CEO turns 28, IPO could be $100B gift Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg turned 28 Monday: Does age matter? By Barbara Ortutay, AP Technology Writer May 14, 2012 10:17 AM FILE - In this May, 26, 2010 file photo, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg talks about the social network site's new privacy settings in Palo Alto, Calif. Zuckerberg and other executives addressed about 200 prospective investors Friday, May 10, 2012 at a hotel luncheon in Silicon Valley. (AP Photo/Marcio Jose Sanchez, File) NEW YORK (AP) -- He famously wears a hoodie, jeans and sneakers, and he was born the year Apple introduced the Macintosh. But Mark Zuckerberg is no boy-CEO. Facebook's chief executive turned 28 on Monday, setting in motion the social network's biggest week ever. The company is expected to start selling stock to the public for the first time and begin trading on the Nasdaq Stock Market on Friday. The IPO could value Facebook at nearly $100 billion, making it worth more than such iconic companies as Disney, Ford and Kraft Foods. At 28, Zuckerberg is exactly half the age of the average S&P 500 CEO, according to executive search firm Spencer Stuart. With eight years on the job, he's logged more time as leader than the average CEO, whose tenure is a little more than seven years, according to Spencer Stuart. Even so, the pressures of running a public company will undoubtedly take some getting used to. Once Facebook begins selling stock, Zuckerberg will be expected to please a host of new stakeholders, including Wall Street investment firms, hedge funds and pension funds who will pressure him to keep the company growing. Young as he may seem — especially in that hooded sweatshirt — Zuckerberg will be about the same age as Michael Dell and older than Steve Jobs when those two took their companies, Dell Inc. and Apple Inc., public. In his years as Facebook's CEO he's met world leaders, rode a bull in Vietnam while on vacation, started learning Mandarin Chinese and as a personal challenge, wore a tie for the better part of a year. Facebook, of course, got its start in Zuckerberg's messy Harvard dorm room in early 2004. Known as Thefacebook.com in those days, the site was created to help Harvard students — and later other college students — connect with one another online. The scrappy website later grew to include high-schoolers, then anyone else with an Internet connection. Today more than 900 million people log in at least once a month, making Facebook the world's definitive social network. All along, Zuckerberg has shown a maturity beyond his years. As the site grew rapidly and caught the eye of big media and rival Internet companies, Zuckerberg consistently rebuffed mouth-watering buyout offers, including those from Google Inc. and Yahoo Inc. ""Simply put: we don't build services to make money; we make money to build better services,"" Zuckerberg wrote in his letter to prospective shareholders. ""And we think this is a good way to build something. These days I think more and more people want to use services from companies that believe in something beyond simply maximizing profits."" People who've observed Zuckerberg closely say his age is an asset. His is the generation that grew up with social networking, with computers all around them and the Internet as something that's always existed. Many of his employees are younger than him, as are a lot of the up-and-coming technology entrepreneurs with whom he competes. ""I don't think you could build a company like this if you were an old guy like me,"" says David Kirkpatrick, a 59-year-old author who chronicled the company's early history in ""The Facebook Effect."" Kirkpatrick, who is also founder of Techonomy, a media company that hosts conferences on the relationship between technology and economy and social progress, first met Zuckerberg six years ago. He says he was impressed with his vision, even then. ""It's the willingness to take risks, the willingness to abide by a very contemporary vision ... I don't think that he's too young. I think most CEOs are too old."" Zuckerberg, who lives in Palo Alto, Calif. with his girlfriend and a white Hungarian Puli dog named Beast, has matured as a leader with the help of experienced mentors. One of his closest advisers is Sheryl Sandberg, whom he hired away from Google in 2008. Zuckerberg, known for sometimes-awkward public appearances, realized that the razor-sharp, people-savvy advertising executive complements his own shortcomings. Sandberg is Zuckerberg's No. 2, the chief operating officer who oversees advertising and often serves as Facebook's smiling, public face. Then there's Donald Graham, the 66-year-old CEO and chairman of The Washington Post Co., who serves as a mentor to Zuckerberg and holds a seat on Facebook's board of directors. Rebecca Lieb, analyst at the Altimeter Group, says Zuckerberg has assembled a team of ""truly exceptional lieutenants."" David Ebersman, Facebook's chief financial officer, who hails from biotech firm Genentech, is another example. Zuckerberg hired him in 2009, saying that Ebersman's previous job, helping to scale the finance organization of the fast-growing biotech company ""will be important to Facebook."" He was right. Facebook's revenue grew from $777 million in 2009 to $3.7 billion last year. In the first quarter of 2012 it was more than $1 billion. Even so, Zuckerberg still has a lot to learn. As part of Facebook's pre-IPO ""road show"" last week, Zuckerberg visited several venerable East Coast financial institutions wearing his signature hoodie. While Silicon Valley insiders defended his fashion choice, others saw it as a sign of immaturity. Was it, as some speculated, a sign of a rebellious 20-something acting out? For Michael Pachter, analyst at Wedbush Securities, Zuckerberg's attitude and attire symbolizes ""a level of aloofness to stakeholders."" ""He seems very customer focused and very employee focused. I am not sure he cares about anyone else. ... If he's going to go public, he has to answer to shareholders,"" Pachter says. ""That's why Google hired Eric Schmidt. That's why Steve Jobs was ultimately forced out of Apple."" Jobs, in fact, was another Silicon Valley luminary who had Zuckerberg's ear. He was 25 in 1980 when Apple went public. He was ousted five years later after clashing with John Sculley, the former Pepsico executive Apple hired as chief executive. Jobs famously returned to lead Apple in 1997 and the company has thrived since. Not much is known about the relationship Jobs and Zuckerberg shared, but Jobs reportedly told his biographer Walter Isaacson: ""We talk about social networks in the plural, but I don't see anybody other than Facebook out there. Just Facebook, They are dominating this. I admire Mark Zuckerberg ... for not selling out, for wanting to make a company. I admire that a lot."" When Jobs died last October, Zuckerberg wrote on his Facebook page, ""Steve, thank you for being a mentor and a friend. Thanks for showing that what you build can change the world. I will miss you."" Jon Burgstone, professor at the Center for Entrepreneurship and Technology at the University of California, Berkeley, believes that Zuckerberg will need to keep his perspective and continue developing. ""He has already become one of the world's most famous people, and also the richest,"" he says. ""He walks into a room and you can feel people's excitement and the rush to be near him. He's already had time to learn how to deal with such fame and fortune, but now it's advancing to an entirely new level. How will he handle it, emotionally and professionally?"" Lieb marvels at the life Zuckerberg has led so far. Imagine being in your 20s, a self-made billionaire, your life the subject of a Hollywood movie, 2010's ""The Social Network."" ""It's a lifetime and the guy isn't 30 yet,"" Lieb says. He's made big mistakes, especially with regard to users' privacy. One example is Beacon, Facebook's misguided advertising product that broadcast user's activities on outside websites without their explicit consent. Still, he took steps to correct them. On blog posts about Facebook's privacy blunders, he's admitted the company has made mistakes. His 2007 post about Beacon showed his straightforward, methodical thinking: ""We've made a lot of mistakes building this feature, but we've made even more with how we've handled them. We simply did a bad job with this release, and I apologize for it. While I am disappointed with our mistakes, we appreciate all the feedback we have received from our users. I'd like to discuss what we have learned and how we have improved Beacon,"" he wrote five years ago. Facebook shut down Beacon two years later. Zuckerberg has done well for himself so far, but he'll be pulled in many directions once Facebook is public. ""There is going to be a tremendous amount of scrutiny on this company,"" Lieb says. ""Who really is qualified"" to carry such a weight? ____ Follow Barbara Ortutay on Twitter at http://twitter.com/BarbaraOrtutay Stocks slammed!

"Why Mark Zuckerberg Might Be Too Successful In its brief, eight-year history, Facebook has become one of the all-time legendary success stories. But there's still one thing missing from founder Mark Zuckerberg's resume: A prominent failure to learn ... http://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-mark-zuckerberg-might-too-170039566.html Why Mark Zuckerberg Might Be Too Successful - Yahoo Finance Why Mark Zuckerberg Might Be Too Successful May 9, 2012 4:55 PM In its brief, eight-year history, Facebook has become one of the all-time legendary success stories. But there's still one thing missing from founder Mark Zuckerberg's resume: A prominent failure to learn from. [ Photos: Occupy Wall Street: Fighting or Floundering? ] Of course, we'd all avoid failure if we could. But setbacks happen to just about everybody, and they often turn out to be the most instructive experiences we ever go through. ""Ask one hundred people, 'What have you learned from success?' and most of them will just look at you,"" former Coca-Cola president Don Keough told me while I was researching my book Rebounders: How Winners Pivot From Setback To Success . ""But ask, 'What have you learned from failure?' and you'll get lots of answers."" Setbacks usually don't feel so illuminating when they're happening, and some people don't even like to admit when something goes wrong. But just about every business involves some kind of risk, which makes flops and failures inevitable. That's especially true in Silicon Valley, where investors routinely take big risks on startups. As a rule of thumb, about 40 percent of startups funded by venture capitalists fail, 40 percent are successful enough to return their initial investment, and only 20 percent turn out to be good investments that return a healthy profit. And only a fraction of those enjoy the staggering success that Facebook is poised to enjoy in its huge public offering. With a high risk of failure, venture capitalists don't worry so much about preventing it. Instead, they try to spot failures early, so that resources aren't wasted beyond the point of no return. They also intently study failures in order to make sure there's no missed opportunity or new direction that might be more productive. As many investors know, for example, Viagra was initially developed as a hypertension drug that didn't pan out. Only by accident did researchers notice that it seemed to enhance the sexual potency of male rabbits, leading to its development as a treatment for erectile dysfunction. [ See 6 reasons America will rebound .] Savvy investors also value failure as an essential ingredient in the seasoning needed to develop capable business leaders. ""When considering investing in a company, I always ask a CEO, 'Tell me about your failures,'"" says one prominent venture capitalist. ""If you haven't had a failure, you don't have your strength. Somebody who has only experienced success is likely to be so convinced they're brilliant that it never occurs to them they might just be lucky."" Mark Zuckerberg is probably both brilliant and lucky. He's clearly a visionary who figured out new ways to use technology to connect people. He's also lucky he became a programmer just as the Internet became the backbone of mass communication. Talent and luck can be a pretty awesome combination, so it's no surprise Zuckerberg is already a technology titan and billionaire before his 30th birthday. But he may also be a massive case of hubris in the making. Zuckerberg has structured Facebook so that he'll retain an extraordinary degree of control, even after five percent of the shares go public. He negotiated the recent $1 billion acquisition of Instagram almost entirely on his own, over a weekend, with minimal input from his board or other senior executives. Facebook's registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission even states that Zuckerberg and his family and friends can fly on company-financed planes, for personal use, with the cost accounted for as Zuckerberg's ""other compensation."" It's hard to think of another sizeable company so dominated by one person, especially one so untouched by marketplace ups and downs. [ See why Apple could get even bigger .] If Zuckerberg's meteoric success convinces him that he's infallible, Facebook will be in trouble. Richard Fuld of Lehman Brothers seems to have developed a sense of invulnerability, which prevented him from spotting what was really wrong with his firm--and possibly saving it--before it went bankrupt. Rupert Murdoch's sense of omnipotence may have led him to believe his company, News Corp., could break the law and get away with it. Yet the phone-hacking scandal at Murdoch's British papers has damaged the entire company. Many other corporate titans fumbled because they became too convinced that they could do no wrong. Setbacks leaven that type of arrogance. When I was researching , Tim Westergren, the founder of Internet radio company Pandora, told me about the difficulties he faced in two prior careers before he got the idea for Pandora, and the several near-death experiences Pandora had while he was trying to get it off the ground. Those challenges gave Westergren the opportunity to use and build his talents, but they also revealed the limits of his abilities. ""I'm in the church of humility,"" he told me. ""If you're humble, you don't get caught up in the trappings of success, which can be very corrupting for most people. You can get drunk on that if you're not humble."" We now get to see whether Mark Zuckerberg can beat the odds, and stay sober-minded in spite of his gargantuan success.

"Must-know: Twitter stock has been hot, but is it a good deal? Twitter stock as appreciated rapidly since its recent IPO, but is it worth the price? Find out why we think Twitter is a bad deal. http://finance.yahoo.com/news/must-know-twitter-stock-hot-193451595.html Must-know: Twitter stock has been hot, but is it a good deal? - Yahoo Finance Must-know: Twitter stock has been hot, but is it a good deal? December 30, 2013 2:34 PM Why Twitter is like the cronut—in demand, but hyped and overvalued (Part 1 of 5) One of the buzziest topics in the investing world lately has been Twitter (TWTR). The social media company was one of the most sought-after IPOs of the year as the stock popped to $44.90 per share on its first trading day, after the IPO priced at $26 per share. Since then, the stock has had a strong rally and closed on December 20, 2013, at $63.75 per share, resulting in a market cap of over $36 billion. However, the market’s perception of Twitter’s valuation is far beyond the company’s fundamental valuation. We’re not saying the stock will decline in price, but we can say that where it’s priced is probably not what it’s worth, and that relative to its comps, Twitter is probably too expensive.

Chinese solar PV maker JinkoSolar Holding Co. Ltd. (NYSE: JKS) and ... http://finance.yahoo.com/news/secondary-offerings-jinkosolar-shutterstock-send-161000001.html Secondary Offerings at JinkoSolar, Shutterstock Send Shares Higher - Yahoo Finance Secondary Offerings at JinkoSolar, Shutterstock Send Shares Higher September 20, 2013 12:10 PM It is not often that a secondary stock offering sends a company’s shares higher, but we are seeing that very phenomenon Friday morning. Chinese solar PV maker JinkoSolar Holding Co. Ltd. ( JKS ) and stock image company Shutterstock Inc. ( SSTK ) both priced secondary offerings this morning and shares in both companies have risen sharply. At JinkoSolar, shares priced at $16.25, after closing Thursday night at $16.48, and shortly before noon the stock was up by 13.8% at $18.75. The company offered 3.8 million shares and an underwriters’ option on an additional 570,000. JinkoSolar says it will use proceeds for general corporate purposes, which may include expanding its manufacturing capacity. That by itself should have sent shares down. ALSO READ: Famous Restaurant Chains That Are Hard to Find Shutterstock closed last night at $60.32 and priced its offering of 4.6 million shares at $60.00 this morning. The company is selling only 1 million shares; the rest are being sold by some existing shareholders. The underwriters have an option on an additional 690,000 shares. The company said the purpose behind the offering is to increase the company’s public float, among other things. As far as JinkoSolar is concerned, part of the reason for the price jump is almost certainly a short squeeze. Institutional investors also are likely the heaviest buyers as they move toward some momentum stocks to juice up returns. ALSO READ: The Countries with the Most Multimillionaires Shutterstock only had a public float of about 6.5 million shares, so it is likely adding liquidity. The stock is up more than 200% since the company’s IPO, and we can assume that there are real buyers out there who want in on the party. In addition, nearly 13% of the stock is held short, so there is some covering going on as well. Still, it is an interesting turn of events to see shares jump on secondary offerings. Shares of JinkoSolar are trading at $18.43 a few minutes after noon on Friday, in a 52-week range of $3.18 to $20.06. Shutterstock’s shares are up nearly 12% at $67.46, after posting a new 52-week high earlier this morning of $68.42. The 52-week low is the IPO price of $21.00.

We are seeing major ... http://finance.yahoo.com/news/companies-raising-over-3-billion-140056268.html Companies Raising Over $3 Billion in New Stock Sales - Yahoo Finance Companies Raising Over $3 Billion in New Stock Sales September 10, 2013 10:00 AM The stock market is looking healthier and healthier again, and it is not just because the S&P 500 is within striking distance of 1,700 and because the DJIA has crossed back over 15,000. We are seeing major secondary offerings from companies themselves and from their insiders and backers. When companies sell shares it is generally into a strong market. That being said, investors have to sometimes wonder if they want to buy stock when a company wants to sell more stock to the public. 24/7 Wall St. has tracked offerings from and involving the following companies: Armstrong World Industries Inc. ( AWI ); Enbridge Energy Management LLC ( EEQ ), Enbridge Energy Partners L.P. ( EEP ), Inergy Midstream L.P. ( NRGM ), Marketo Inc. ( MKTO ), Starwood Property Trust Inc. ( STWD ), Stratasys Ltd. ( SSYS ) and Virtus Investment Partners Inc. ( VRTS ). Ten Brands That Will Disappear in 2014 What should really stand out here is not just that these combined offerings come to more than $2.4 billion. We did not include several other offerings, and those in total would come up to close to another $1 billion. We have added color and reference on each offering versus its average volume and size. Armstrong World Industries Inc. ( AWI ) has an offering of 10,057,382 common shares held by Armstrong World Industries, Asbestos Personal Injury Settlement Trust and Armor TPG Holdings. Note that the company has agreed to purchase 5,057,382 of the 10,057,382 common shares of this offering at a price per share equal to the price paid by the underwriter. Shares are trading at $52.37, and the 52-week trading range is $43.30 to $58.48. This is some $520 million in gross dollars, or about $250 million if you back out the shares being repurchased. Seven Highly Educated Jobs Making the Least Money Enbridge Energy Management LLC ( EEQ ) has filed to sell 8 million of its listed shares (units). Proceeds will be used to invest in an equal number of i-units of Enbridge Energy Partners L.P. ( EEP ). Enbridge Partners will then use the proceeds to purchase additional shares to repay its commercial paper, to finance a portion of its capital expansion program and for general partnership purposes. The ""Management-EEQ"" units are down 4% at $28.67, against a 52-week range of $25.81 to $32.30. The ""Partners-EEP"" shares closed at $30.20, versus a 52-week range of $26.88 to $33.49. This comes to almost $240 million before the exercise of any overallotment shares (units). Inergy Midstream L.P. ( NRGM ) is trading down by 4.6%, at $22.19 against a 52-week range of $21.03 to $26.01, after filing to sell 11 million common units. The gross proceeds appear to be around $242 million or so. Be advised that the units are being sold by its limited partners. Marketo Inc. ( MKTO ) already has filed to sell 6 million shares of its common stock, with 5.3 million being sold by existing shareholders and Marketo offering about 700,000 shares in the offering. This offering may seem small at about $200 million, but this is right into a lock-up period since its IPO came out in May. Many investors find offerings in bad taste on a ""Sell as immediately as you can,"" but this one did very well since its IPO as well. Starwood Property Trust Inc. ( STWD ) has priced a 25 million share offering of common stock to raise just over $600 million in gross proceeds. The company intends to use the net proceeds to originate and purchase additional commercial mortgage loans and other target assets and investments, and it included the ""for other general corporate purposes"" disclaimer in the release. The $600 million compares to a market cap of about $4.04 billion, while the 25 million shares compares to an average daily volume of about 2 million shares. Apple: What Happens When Everyone Knows About a Product Release? Stratasys Ltd. ( SSYS ) is selling 4 million shares of its ordinary shares, representing close to $400 million in gross proceeds. Its market cap is just over $4 billion, and it trades about 825,000 shares per day on average. Virtus Investment Partners Inc. ( VRTS ) has done incredibly well as a stock, and it has now filed to sell roughly $175 million worth of its common stock. That would be roughly 1 million shares based on the current price, versus an average daily volume of only about 50,000 shares. Virtus has a market cap of $1.37 billion before the impact of this offering. These were just the offerings that we deemed to be of significant value. There were seven or eight other offerings that probably come close to another $1 billion or so in combined size. As a reminder, when companies and insiders sell more stock, those funds to purchase the new shares on the market generally are used in place of what would have otherwise been market-oriented stocks.

"We're Living in a 'Tech Depression': Andreessen Don't expect a game changing tech IPO anytime soon. Private tech companies are steering clear of going public as long as they can, said Marc Andreessen, the co-founder of the venture capital firm Andreessen ... http://finance.yahoo.com/news/were-living-tech-depression-andreessen-100130066.html We're Living in a 'Tech Depression': Andreessen - Yahoo Finance We're Living in a 'Tech Depression': Andreessen May 14, 2013 6:01 AM Don't expect a game changing tech initial public offering anytime soon. Private tech companies are steering clear of going public as long as they can manage, said Marc Andreessen, the co-founder of the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, on CNBC's ""Closing Bell"" Monday. ""When you say what's the next big IPO, the brutal truth is I don't know and I'm not sure there is going to be one for quite while because the incentives are so strong to keep these companies private,"" Andreessen said. : Software Out, Hardware Start-Ups In ) The hangover felt from the dot-com crash and financial crisis has spurred an era of over regulation in the public markets which has essentially caused a backlash from private companies that are refusing to go public, Andreessen said. Emerging entrepreneurs see the public markets as ""incredibly hostile,"" he said. ""The new running theory among new entrepreneurs is never take your company public or don't do it as long as you possibly can,"" Andreessen said. Andreessen, who has invested in tech companies including, Facebook ( FB ), Twitter, and Pinterest, said that another reason tech companies are hesitant to go public is because of the pain still felt from the dot-com crash. : Facebook in Talks to Buy Israel's Waze: Report ) ""A lot of people got burned during the dot-com crash, so I think we are living through the other side of that, I think we are living through sort of the tech depression, is the term I've used,"" he said. ""But at the same time I can tell you that the vast majority of the interesting new companies that are sort of at the $50 million to $100 million revenue stage,that have historically have been the source of the exciting IPOs that put growth into the market, those companies are quite simply staying private, they aren't going public."" : Signs of Another Tech Bubble: VC ) While there were about 8,800 public companies in 1997, there were about 4,100 publicly traded companies in 2012, a decline that can be contributed to a war being waged on the public markets via regulations like Sarbanes-Oaxley and Regulation FD, which were put in place to help derisk the market. But these regulations do more harm than good, Andreessen said. (Read More Below the Video.) ""We seem to have collectively decided as a society that we want to strip risks out of the public markets, so we had the dot-com crash, we had the financial crisis, and we decided that we don't like risk anymore,"" he said. ""So there have been a series of regulatory reforms, a series of corporate governance movements, and the result has been a huge disincentive for companies to go public, and of course the problem with that is if new companies don't go public then you get exactly what we are seeing, which is the number of public companies falling."" Because the number of public companies is falling, growth is being stripped out of the public markets, which will ultimately pave the way for a two-tiered system, he said. ""If you kill risk, you kill growth. If you kill growth you kill returns. And as a result the market is becoming a two-tiered system and I think that is bad,"" he said. ""Funds like ours-that primarily represent, frankly, rich people, rich people's pensions, rich people's colleges and foreign countries' sovereign wealth funds-generally, are doing fine."" However, he said that on the public side, growth is being drained out of the market, and that could hurt many Americans in the long-term. ""Of course the public market is where most ordinary Americans retirement savings is held in the form of mutual funds and pension funds and if we keep with this approach of over regulation in the public markets, we're not going to have returns for peoples' retirement accounts, which means people aren't going to be able to retire,"" he said. ""And I think that is going to be the big problem that comes out of that and I think that's where we are heading straight towards that right now.""

At its peak, the stock traded at nearly $600, versus around $500 now. With earnings expected after the close Thursday, investors will be looking for any sign that the mounting controversy and legal issues over the injuries and deaths allegedly related to da Vinci procedures are affecting the company's growth. (Read More Below the Video.) : What Happens When the Surgical Robot Malfunctions? ) Over the past two quarters, growth in sales and profits slowed considerably, but it is still robust by most standards, with sales in the fourth quarter leaping 23 percent. Driving gains has been growing use of the da Vinci for hysterectomies and other gynecological procedures. Forecasts for this quarter are for earnings per share of 43 cents on revenue of $282 million. But as more reports of complications have come to light, the da Vinci debate is heating up. In late February, the FDA launched a probe calling for voluntary information from hospitals and surgeons using the da Vinci, in an effort to determine ""if the rise in reports may be a true reflection of problems."" Speaking at an investor meeting in early March, the company said, ""The relationship we have with the FDA has been a long and very strong relationship."" In mid-March the American Congress of Obstetricians and and Gynecologists issued a statement, warning that ""studies show there is a learning curve with new surgical technologies, during which there is an increased complication rate."" Robotic Surgery: Growing Sales, but Growing Concerns ) And five days later, the Massachusetts Board of Registration in Medicine weighed in with an advisory citing an ""increasing number of reports of patient complications associated with robot-assisted surgery."" In a statement to CNBC, Intuitive said: ""In any definitive treatment for complex disease, such as surgery of the cancerous prostate, heart, or other major organs there are risks of complications. Robotic surgery has proven benefits in reducing the risk and complications associated with open surgical procedures thereby extending the benefits of minimally invasive surgery to a broader population of patients. Overall, adverse event rates are very low. Da Vinci surgery has been shown to be safer than the open surgery alternatives in numerous independent large scale, peer reviewed studies.""

"A Big Week for IPOs, and More Are Coming It's a big week for initial public offerings, and more are coming. Finally, it looks like IPOs are starting to catch up with the market. http://finance.yahoo.com/news/big-week-ipos-more-coming-142923777.html A Big Week for IPOs, and More Are Coming - Yahoo Finance A Big Week for IPOs, and More Are Coming April 12, 2013 10:29 AM Traders work on the floor at the New York Stock Exchange, April 11, 2013. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid It's a big week for initial public offerings, and more are coming. Finally, it looks like IPOs are starting to catch up with the market. This was a big week for IPOs, in terms of number and how well most of them did. Six companies went public this week, and about $1.5 billion was raised. Four of the six increased the number of shares offered, or priced above the expected range, or both. That is bullish. You don't see this type of activity in a bear market. For the first quarter about $7.8 billion was raised, according to John Fitzgibbon at IPO Scoop. That is much better than the first quarter of 2012, when $5.9 billion was raised. The IPO market is a follower, not a leader ... but it's catching up. And there are more coming. Seven IPOs are on tap for next week, looking to raise $1.9 billion. Another big one was just announced: HD Supply Holdings (12 percent owned by Home Depot) filed for a large ($1 billion) IPO. The company went private for $8.5 billion in 2007. (More From CNBC: Cramer Says Wells Fargo Missed a 'Great Mortgage Moment' ) Two IPOs priced overnight: Payment processing company Evertec (to be traded under the symbol ""EVTC"") priced 25.3 million shares at $20, the high end of the price range of $18 to $20 a share, while Rally Software (""RALY"") priced 6 million shares $14. That is above the initial share count of 5.75 million and above the price talk of $11 to $13 a share. Rally provides cloud-based systems for Agile software development projects, which is a methodology for best practices in developing software. 1) JPMorgan Chase: Poke all the holes you want. It continues to hit the numbers, and it's got a ton of money. The usual pundits are coming on, complaining about ""earnings quality."" They do this every quarter. You can say it's making its numbers because it is releasing reserves, you can say it's because it is cutting costs, but still. JPMorgan is making its numbers. Yes, low rates hurt margins, but we've seen that for three years and guys are still finding ways to make money. It is also planning to raise its dividend...it now has a 3.2 percent dividend yield, and is continuing to buy back stock. (More From CNBC: 5 Fiscal Secrets Buried Deep in Obama's Budget ) JPMorgan current earnings estimate for 2013 is about $5.50 a share; it could do $6 a share. That's 8.3 times earnings, with a 3.2 percent dividend. That's not awful. JPMorgan has something like $21 billion in reserves it can release. It can buy back stock, increase its dividend, and still get to 9 percent Tier One capital. And if there is any hint that rates are going to go up, this company will explode. 2) Everyone's getting bearish! What's up with sentiment? Lots of talk last night about the huge plunge in bullish sentiment for the weekly AAII Investor Sentiment Survey. Bullish sentiment is at 19.3 percent for the week ending April 10, down 16.2 points from the prior week, the lowest level since March 5, 2009. Wow. The historic average is 39 percent. Bearish sentiment went to 54.5 percent, up 26.3 points from the prior week, the highest pessimism level since July 8, 2010. Some are noting that there was an unusually low level of respondents this week ... maybe the bears are just more motivated! 3) Finally, a downgrade of two big consumer names. It's been quite a ride for big consumer names this year. Coca-Cola has gone from $36 to $41 a share, PepsiCo has gone from $68 to $80 a share this year and is at an historic high. Today Davenport downgraded both to ""neutral"" on valuation, but also noted that for Coca-Cola was likely ""weaker than expected."" It certainly is a bit of a mystery why these stocks have been flying: Coke had only 1 percent volume growth in the fourth quarter of 2012 and is trading at roughly 19 times forward earnings. Pepsi is trading at 18 times forward earnings. 3) Gold collapses, breaking to near 12-month lows.

"Model N, Tetraphase IPOs Debut Two IPOs hit the market today ¡ndash; with two very different first-day performances. http://finance.yahoo.com/news/model-n-tetraphase-ipos-debut-205808421.html Model N, Tetraphase IPOs Debut - Yahoo Finance Model N, Tetraphase IPOs Debut March 20, 2013 4:58 PM Two IPOs hit the market today – with two very different first-day performances. Model N ( MODN ) , a provider of revenue management software to the life science and technology sectors, was up 28% in its debut despite pricing above its expected range. The stock went public at $15.50 a share, ahead of its predicted $12.50-$14.50 range. But that didn’t stop it from rising all the way to $19.84 on Wednesday. Tetraphase Pharmaceutical’s ( TTPH ) IPO wasn’t quite as effective. A developer of antibiotics that treat serious abdominal and urinary tract infections, Tetraphase shares priced at $7 a share – well below the $10 to $12 range listed in the company’s original IPO filing. The stock didn’t budge from there, finishing at exactly $7 after rising as high as $7.50. Six more companies are scheduled to go public in the coming days, including another pharmaceutical company called Enanta. Tetraphase’s first-day struggles likely have Enanta officials a bit more apprehensive about their company’s IPO. On the flip side, Marin Software is surely encouraged by Model N’s smashing debut. That should embolden the San Francisco-based cloud-computing company ahead of its IPO, which could come by week’s end. Model N and Tetraphase were just the fourth and fifth companies to go public this month. More From Wyatt Investment Research Fed Meeting By the Numbers How is March Madness Useful in Investing?

And there are several reasons why 360buy should in fact wait even longer. While  IPO rumors have come and gone , the latest reason for the speculation is the  similar chatter about Alibaba Group , China’s largest e-commerce company and 360buy’s biggest rival. (Alibaba’s TMall is thought to have some 45% of the business-to-consumer (B2C) market share , compared with 360buy’s 17%.) Some say an imminent Alibaba listing puts pressure on 360buy  to move first in order to beat Alibaba to the punch. But investors in an IPO will ask whether 360buy can make a real profit, and some analysts doubt it.  360buy follows an Amazon model when it comes to logistics and, as a result, it is burning through cash to expand its capacity in deliveries, warehousing and inventory. Furthermore, many of its products are low-margin electronic goods. That pits it against Suning Appliance, a brick-and-mortar retailer listed in Shanghai which is breaking into e-commerce, and is planning to  spend $3.5 billion on ramping up . Alibaba follows a different model—one that’s high-margin and low-cost. That means apple-to-apple comparisons with 360buy aren’t entirely appropriate. Alibaba’s TMall is a collection of thousands of virtual stores for brands like Prada, Gucci, Gap and, as of yesterday, Microsoft . Those stores handle the deliveries, which means Alibaba doesn’t rack up high capital costs; the company doubled its net income to $273 million in the second quarter of last year. As a result, for Alibaba an IPO is logical for funding its growth. The company may go public in the fourth quarter this year, though no decisions have been made, according to sources. Where 360buy sees TMall’s Achilles heel, the source told Quartz, is in logistics. TMall doesn’t handle deliveries, so it’s unusually vulnerable to bottlenecks in China’s backward parcel delivery system. It recently formed a coalition with delivery and real estate companies to help get around this. 360buy wants to invest in warehousing and logistics to give itself a competitive edge, the source said. Last month 360buy raked in $700 million in its latest fundraising round—enough cash to make the final push toward profitability and making a public listing a medium-term goal, the industry source said. CEO Richard Liu said he expects to be  profitable only in 2014  (link in Chinese), though the source said that could happen as soon as the end of 2013. But most of that $700 million will go into building up its logistics, putting further pressure on its already low-margin business and making an IPO premature.  Another sign that it’s too early for 360buy to consider listing is that valuation estimates have been in flux, when they normally go steadily up for a company in pre-public mode. All this suggests 360buy isn’t ready to start unveiling its financials, much less go on a road show to pitch the company. If it sells itself too early to investors, it risks having its IPO become a flop. Even if Alibaba beats it to going public, 360buy is better off waiting to solidify its business first.

The company had waited a long time before going public (it filed its initial paperwork in 2011) and green tech stocks haven’t been embraced by the market. But when the IPO finally came,  the stock jumped by almost 30% after its debut, showing a successful IPO is just as much about art as it is science. The IPO market has been rife with cautionary tales lately, leading some to question the mechanisms used to price and assess demand. Some like Facebook  seem overpriced and then drop in the market after going public, while others like LinkedIn jump so much that underwriters are accused of underpricing the IPO. The New York Times recently argued that Goldman Sachs severely underpriced  the 1999 eToys IPO —though others argued it was overpriced given the fundamentals of eToys, which later went out of business. Unfortunately, there is no magic formula for setting an IPO. The science—the numbers for revenue, customers and profitability—is important, helping establish an IPO’s timing and the share price range. But then comes the art, which is in the form of the IPO road show. This is when the company and its underwriters tell their story, in addition to assessing investor appetite and concerns. Facebook did a bad job of both. During the road show, some investors expressed concerns about the company’s future growth, especially because Facebook released some negative information about its mobile advertising during that time. Instead of taking investors’ worries as a hint to be more conservative on the IPO, Facebook and its lead underwriter went the other way. For Silver Spring, the company and its underwriters, Goldman Sachs and Credit Suisse, knew they had to explain to investors why they waited so long to go public, according to sources. But they also talked about the company’s growth prospects, including in places like South America and Asia, and other promising data, the sources said. And they made the pitch to the kinds of investors who understand Silver Spring’s niche business. Silver Spring also wanted the stock to go up by a reasonable amount after it debuted, sources added; this “pop” has psychological value. So the pricing was relatively conservative. But after getting signs of interest from investors, Silver Spring increased the quantity of shares it would sell, albeit not by too much; and it didn’t alter the $17 price. It remains to be seen whether Silver Spring can sustain its IPO bump. But it was trading just above $22 in its second day on the market. And an IPO that had its naysayers is now being seen as a positive sign for  investors in green energy technology, and in the tech market in general.

According to the territory’s South China Morning Post, China’s largest e-commerce company, Alibaba Group, is discussing Nasdaq (paywall) as the venue for its long-awaited listing. An IPO could value Alibaba at  more than $40 billion , making it potentially the biggest tech IPO in history . If the company chooses a US listing, that would be a further blow to the Chinese territory, where the value of IPOs on the stock exchange plummeted to a four year low last year as mainland China’s economic slowdown made investors less interested in allocating cash there. Chinese internet firms have a long record of choosing the Nasdaq over Hong Kong, mainly because they tend to be fast-growing but also young and loss-making.  The Hong Kong stock exchange requires companies conducting IPOs to have earned a profit for three years before going public. But Alibaba  is profitable  (its part-owner Yahoo discloses its finances).  So it would not be forced to choose a US exchange over Hong Kong in the way that Chinese  social networking business Renren , for example, had to. However, it would be not be unusual if Alibaba were meeting with banks and stock exchange representatives in Hong Kong and New York to see where it would get the best valuation for its shares. Investment bankers in both cities have been crowding around the company and trying to get hired on the IPO. It was reported  (paywall) last month that Alibaba executives were set to meet potential advisers to discuss a Hong Kong listing. Alibaba Group includes Alibaba.com, an online marketplace connecting Chinese manufacturers with overseas buyers, and auction site Taobao. Alibaba.com was previously listed on the Hong Kong exchange. It was taken private by Alibaba Group founder Jack Ma last year in a move widely viewed as a precursor to an IPO of his entire business. An Alibaba Group spokesman declined to comment.

"Professional Diversity Network IPO Struggles Professional Diversity Network¡rsquo;s (NASDAQ: IPDN) IPO fell flat in its market debut yesterday, getting the March initial public offerings market off to an inauspicious start. http://finance.yahoo.com/news/professional-diversity-network-ipo-struggles-195953813.html Professional Diversity Network IPO Struggles - Yahoo Finance Professional Diversity Network IPO Struggles March 6, 2013 2:59 PM Professional Diversity Network’s ( IPDN ) IPO fell flat in its market debut yesterday, getting the March initial public offerings market off to an inauspicious start. The first stock to go public on a U.S. market in nearly three weeks, the Professional Diversity Network IPO declined 4% in its first day of trading and is down another 5.6% today. That doesn’t bode well for the provider of online networking and job opportunities for minorities, which went public below its expected range at $8 a share. It was also a lukewarm kickoff for the March IPO market on the heels of a busy first two months of 2013 . Twelve companies went public in January – the most since 2006. February brought another eight IPOs – less than the last two Februarys, but more than the previous three. The returns have been even better. Year-to-date, the 21 companies that have gone public have returned an average of more than 15%. Only five of them have actually fallen since their debuts – another bad sign for Professional Diversity Network. Up next on the IPO schedule are Artisan Partners Asset Management , a Wisconsin-based investment management business, and Silver Spring Networks , which provides smart grid products and services. According to IPO web site Renaissance Capital, no other public offerings are in the hopper – which could bode for a slower March than in recent years.

And a common point analysts raised just before its 2011 IPO was that Glencore’s majority shareholders may be selling out because they predicted the world resources “supercycle,” as commodities bulls used to call it, was about to be punctured. Glencore’s 2o12 earnings, released today, will have its IPO cynics chuckling at the prescience of their foresight. Last year, Glencore’s net income  crashed 75% . That was partly because of a decline in the value of Glencore’s stake in Russian aluminum producer Rusal, but generally because its sales prices declined as  China’s growth slowed . While the London and Hong Kong flotation  made billionaires of Glencore’s bosses, it’s not at all provable that CEO Ivan Glasenberg saw into the future with mystic accuracy before selling part of his company to outsiders. Maybe he just wanted to spread the fruits of his company’s success more widely and was as surprised by the supercycle accident as many others in the resources industry  (paywall). Still, the IPO timing looks brilliant for those who swapped large stakes in the business for cash. Here is what has happened to Glencore’s London share price (blue line) since its stockmarket debut and with the overall performance of the FTSE 100 (yellow line) provided for reference. Ouch.

"Facebook hits new low as IPO lock-up ends Facebook's stock plunged to a new low Thursday as some of the social networking leader's early backers got their first chance to sell their shares since the company's initial public offering went awry.Analysts ... http://finance.yahoo.com/news/facebook-hits-low-ipo-lock-143200785.html Facebook hits new low as IPO lock-up ends - Yahoo Finance Facebook hits new low as IPO lock-up ends Facebook shares hit new depths as lock-up period ends, providing early investors with an out By Barbara Ortutay and Michael Liedtke, AP Technology Writers August 16, 2012 6:54 PM SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Facebook's stock plunged to a new low Thursday as some of the social networking leader's early backers got their first chance to sell their shares since the company's initial public offering went awry. Analysts interpreted the unusually high trading volume as a clear sign that at least a few of the insiders were seizing on a fresh selling opportunity. That is stirring a debate over whether they're simply locking in long-awaited gains on investments made many years ago or bailing out of a company that has lost its luster. A breakdown on just how many major Facebook Inc. shareholders sold their stock probably won't be available until next week at the earliest. Securities regulations give them at least three business days before they have to disclose such transactions. The information is important ""because if you are an investor who has been sitting on the sidelines waiting for a good time to buy the stock, you might decide to stay on the sidelines for a little longer after seeing which insiders decided to sell their stock,"" CapStone Investments analyst Rory Maher said. All told, investors who owned a combined 271 million Facebook shares could have sold their holdings Thursday with the expiration of a ban known as a lock-up period. The restrictions were imposed on a group of venture capitalists, companies and Silicon Valley cognoscente who invested in Facebook during its formative years and sold some of their holdings three months ago when the company went public at $38. The highly anticipated IPO had valued the company at $104 billion, similar to those of Amazon.com Inc. and PepsiCo Inc. The shares have plunged by nearly 50 percent since then amid concerns about whether Facebook is destined to become a passing fancy and worries about whether it will be able to sell more advertising on mobile devices as users gravitate there. Facebook' stock traded as low as $19.69 before bouncing back slightly. The shares closed Thursday at $19.87, down $1.33, or more than 6 percent. The previous low during the day was $19.82 and the previous low for a close was $20.04, both reached Aug. 2 More than 156 million shares were traded, more than five times the stock's average volume over the past month. Trading in the overall market was lighter than usual. The Facebook investors eligible to sell their shares Thursday included venture capital firms Accel Partners and Greylock Partners; investment banker Goldman Sachs Group; software maker Microsoft Corp.; Zynga Inc. CEO Marc Pincus; LinkedIn Corp. Chairman Reid Hoffman; and former PayPal CEO Peter Thiel. If there was mass selling within this group, Facebook's stock could decline further because the market would be flooded with nearly two-thirds more shares. Given that most of these investors put their money into Facebook five to eight years ago, they probably were eager to sell, said Sam Hamadeh, the CEO of PrivCo, a research firm that follows privately held companies. ""A lot of people have been waiting,"" he said. ""Facebook was expected to go public a long time ago."" Despite the sharp drop in Facebook's market value during the past three months, the early investors can still reap huge windfalls by selling at the current price. For instance, Thiel invested $500,000 in Facebook in 2004, the year CEO Mark Zuckerberg began the site in a Harvard dorm room. After selling 16.8 million shares for $640 million at the time of the initial public offering in May, Thiel still owned nearly 28 million shares worth about $560 million at Thursday's trading prices. Accel Partners invested $12.7 million in Facebook in 2005. The firm sold nearly 58 million shares for $2.2 billion as part of Facebook's IPO and still owned nearly 144 million shares worth about $2.9 billion. It wasn't known how many of those shares could have been sold Thursday, and whether any of them were. Because those investors had put up little compared with the shares' value today, ""you can understand why they would want to take some of their money off the table now,"" Maher said. ""But at the same time, you have to wonder if they're thinking that Facebook isn't much of a bargain anymore."" Hamadeh believes the venture capitalists who invested in Facebook realize it's a ""fool's game"" to wait for a better price on the stock. On the flip side, other key investors seem unlikely to sell additional shares right away. Microsoft, which invested $240 million in Facebook in 2007, relies on Facebook's social network to help bring more traffic to its Bing search engine, making it less likely that it would risk antagonizing Facebook executives by bailing out. The software company also doesn't need the money, as it is already is sitting on $63 billion in cash. A Microsoft spokesman declined to comment Thursday. The selling shackles will come off of an additional 1.66 billion locked-up Facebook shares during the next nine months to place more potential pressure on the stock. One of the biggest tests will come in November when about 1.2 billion insider shares will be eligible for sale. The freed-up shares will include those owned by Zuckerberg, the Facebook CEO and founder who sold 30 million shares for $1.1 billion in the May IPO to cover his taxes. Other Internet companies that have gone public in the past year have been hit hard by the expiration of their lock-up periods. On Tuesday, shares of online reviews service Angie's List suffered their biggest one-day drop so far and closed at a new low following the expiration of a similar ban. The price dropped, even though there was no word on whether any of the major investors had dumped their shares. LinkedIn, which runs a professional networking version of Facebook, also took a big hit when restrictions on insider selling lifted last November. Its shares sank to their trading low of $55.98 after the lock-up period expired, but have since rebounded strongly. The shares closed at $103.99 Thursday, more than twice its IPO price of $45. It appears some investors believe Facebook's stock price is nearing its low point, at least until the next lock-up periods end this fall. Short sellers, a type of investor that bets certain stocks will fall, had been intensifying their focus on Facebook since the company's July 26 report of disappointing revenue growth during the second quarter. To wager against a company, short sellers must borrow the stock of other investors and then make money by paying back the shares at a lower price. The amount of borrowed Facebook shares had spiked from about 70 million before Facebook's second-quarter earnings report to about 92 million at the end of Thursday's trading, said Tim Smith, senior vice president of SunGard Astecs Analytics, which tracks short-selling activity. But sentiments started to shift Thursday as the volume of shares being returned to the lenders outstripped the number being borrowed, Smith said. The cost to borrow Facebook shares also has been declining, a sign that short-selling demand is waning. ""Facebook's stock might be finally bumping along its bottom,"" Smith said. Considering the heavy trading volume, Facebook's stock would have fallen more dramatically if buyers hadn't stepped in, said Louise Yamada, a technical analyst who runs her own research firm. She suspects Facebook insiders are being careful not to flood the market with stock. ""They're smart enough to know if they sell at the same time, the stock would fall,"" Yamada said. It has been a rough run for Facebook. After one of the most-anticipated IPOs in history, Facebook had perhaps the most-botched stock market debut as glitches marred its first day of trading. Things have gotten progressively worse as Facebook's market value has plunged by about $49 billion. The downfall stems from doubts about Facebook's ability to fend off intensifying competition from Internet search leader Google Inc. while trying to develop a plan for increasing the amount of revenue that it brings in from a worldwide audience of 955 million users. The uncertainty means Facebook's stock is likely to be volatile until the end of the year when the majority of the lockups expire. Hamadeh views the end of those selling constraints as a ""dark cloud on the horizon."" ""There is no way around it. It'll be painful,"" he said. ""But hopefully once that selling pressure is gone, it will find its floor and could be a basis for a more stable stock through 2013."" __ AP Business Writer Bernard Condon in New York contributed to this story.

"The Valuation Guru Who Nailed Apple Reveals Facebook's Fair Price He also predicted how Facebook would IPO. http://finance.yahoo.com/news/valuation-guru-nailed-apple-reveals-144217092.html The Valuation Guru Who Nailed Apple Reveals Facebook's Fair Price - Yahoo Finance The Valuation Guru Who Nailed Apple Reveals Facebook's Fair Price May 23, 2012 10:42 AM Aswath Damodaran, NYU's legendary finance professor, has made two monster calls in recent weeks: 1) He sold Apple near the top after holding it for 15 years. 2) He said Facebook would be a "" Goldilocks IPO ""—not too hot, not too cold. That latter call may still be up for debate.  But the bottom line is that it neither surged, nor totally collapsed. In a new guest post on Forbes.com , Damodaran offers a valuation for Facebook: .  That gives the social network a market capitalization of about $70 billion. ""Yes, Facebook can be valued,"" he wrote. Here are the assumptions and caveats he employs in his valuation model: : ""...If the company can maintain a compounded revenue growth of 40% for the next 5 years , with growth rates scaling down after that towards the growth rate of the economy, the firm will have revenues of $44 billion in ten years, which would put it on the same growth path as Google in its first years as a public company."" : ""...If Facebook is able to maintain a (close to Apple’s, and higher than Google’s) as a mature company, it would be pulling off a very difficult feat."" : ""As Facebook’s revenue grows, it will find itself under pressure to pay more for this growth ..."" : ""There is significant risk in the company. In valuing the company,  we use a cost of capital of 11.42% , which would put Facebook in the top quartile of publicly traded U.S. firms in terms of risk."" Damodaran, being a value investor isn't ready to buy. ""With its user base, Facebook has the ingredients to generate sizable profits down the road, albeit with substantial risks along the way,"" he wrote.  ""At the right price, I would buy the company, notwithstanding the uncertainty about the future. At the IPO offering price or even at the price at which it is trading at right now, I would not."" Read the whole post at Forbes.com .

On the ... http://finance.yahoo.com/news/lessons-facebook-ipo-130719545.html Some Lessons From the Facebook IPO - Yahoo Finance Some Lessons From the Facebook IPO May 23, 2012 9:07 AM I have no idea whether Facebook stock will ultimately pan out to be a solid investment. In the short term, the stock is in the red following its IPO debut. A few thoughts: IPOs can be hit or miss. On the plus side, Google debuted in August of 2004 at $85 per share and currently trades at just over $602 per share, a handsome return for longer-term shareholders. The stock peaked at over $700 per share in late 2007 and fell to under $300 per share by late 2008 during the market meltdown. The other side of this coin, at least so far, is Groupon. The company's shares debuted in November of last year at $20 per share, hit a high of just over $31, and currently trade at just under $12 per share. The company's business model and accounting practices have come under question in recent months. Individual stocks can carry great rewards and great risks. I do not deal with individual stocks on behalf of my clients, with the exception of those clients who receive company stock as part of their compensation or those clients who brought individual stock holdings with them when they became clients. Asset allocation and risk control via mutual funds and ETFs works very well for my client base. That said, there is no combination of funds and ETFs that would have provided a return anywhere near what Apple stock has over the past decade plus. However, for every Apple or Google, there is a Microsoft or General Electric. The latter two companies' stock has basically been dead money for the past ten years. Both companies have failed to beat the anemic performance of the S&P 500 Index over the past decade. Microsoft was once itself a high flier. Its stock price broke $10 per share in 1996 and rose to over $58 during 1999. The stock has languished in the $20s for most of the period since 2000, with a few brief exceptions. Individual holdings can also be subject to event risk. An example of this was Union Carbide (now a subsidiary of Dow Chemical) after the disastrous chemical leak in Bhopal, India in 1984. The stock price dropped sharply in the wake of this tragedy. BP's stock was almost $78 per share in late 2007, but it fell to below $30 per share in the wake of the Gulf oil spill. The stock has recovered a bit and currently hovers near $40 per share, but this is still well off of its high. Many investors have no sell discipline. Finding a good price at which to buy an individual stock is much easier than determining when to sell it. Worse yet, I've seen too many investors who refuse to sell a stock in which they have a loss until they break even. Successful investors have sell discipline. Whether you invest in individual stocks and bonds, mutual funds, ETFs, or a combination of these, some basic investing principles should apply: --Invest with a goal in mind, ideally as part of your overall financial plan. -- Diversification is important. -- Control risk . --Rebalance periodically. --Review and monitor your individual holdings. While all of the hype over IPOs like Facebook's is interesting, it should be largely irrelevant to most investors. , CFP®, is a fee-only financial adviser at Asset Strategy Consultants based in Arlington Heights, Ill., where he provides advice to individual clients, retirement plan sponsors, foundations, and endowments.

But it has already set a strong example for entrepreneurs who want to build their companies into influential game-changers instead of taking a safer route--selling out to a competitor or a goliath. [ Photo gallery: A Look Back at Kodak. ] Even after it goes public and must, theoretically, answer to shareholders, Facebook and its 28-year-old CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, will retain an unusual level of autonomy. The public offering has been structured so that Zuckerberg himself will retain enough voting power to make unilateral decisions, if he chooses to--as he apparently did when single-handedly negotiating the recent $1 billion purchase of Instagram. Few company founders, if any, get such an influx of new capital while retaining so much control over their firms. That could end up being a risky business strategy, but for now, it's heartening to entrepreneurs eager to stick with their firms for the long haul. Since the recession hit in 2008, skittish lenders and weak financial markets have depressed the market for initial public offerings and forced many promising startups into the arms of healthier acquirers. Pure Digital, which made the popular Flip video camera, was acquired in 2009 by Cisco--which shut down the Flipcam operation just two years later. Personal-finance startup Mint.com was purchased by Intuit and rolled into its broader lineup of productivity offerings. Google bought Zagat and more than 50 lesser-known companies over the last three years, merging many of them into its existing platform of offerings. [ See why Mark Zuckerberg might be too successful. ] There's nothing wrong with selling your company to a corporate giant, especially if you're an entrepreneur who's eager to do something else or who simply wants the big payday. But acquired companies often lose their mission and sometimes their entire identity. Instead of growing into independent companies that hire people, build a following, and make an impact, they become indistinct parts of a corporate bureaucracy. Some analysts feel the trend toward ""flipping"" companies can erode the self-reinforcing culture of entrepreneurship in places like Silicon Valley, where startups often rely on the cultivation of others who have built their own firms into powerhouses. ""If you create a mercenary culture, it will kill the goose that laid the golden egg,"" says Andy Rachleff, a former venture capitalist who's now CEO of personal-finance startup Wealthfront.com. ""You solve little incremental things, but they don't make much of an impact on society."" Rachleff says entrepreneurs start new companies for three basic reasons: to make a lot of money, to build a great enterprise, or to change the world. Those goals aren't mutually exclusive, obviously, but Zuckerberg has made it clear that his primary intent with Facebook is to change the world (even if he gets rather rich in the process). [ See where the jobs are, and the college grads aren't. ] In an open letter contained in the official registration documents filed with the government, Zuckerberg stated that ""Facebook was not originally created to be a company. It was built to accomplish a social mission--to make the world more open and connected."" He then went on to explain how its entire business strategy is built around that goal--whether shareholders like it or not. Other startup CEOs can only wish they had the standing to dictate terms to their investors, since lenders are firmly in the driver's seat these days. After peaking in 2007, the number of U.S. IPOs plunged in 2008 and 2009, according to consulting firm Pricewaterhouse Coopers. The IPO market recovered somewhat in 2010, then fell back in 2011. This year, it's on a pace to eclipse last year's activity, but it's still about 30 percent below the pace of deals in 2007. ""It's starting to look normal,"" says Henri Leveque, a partner at PwC. ""We're seeing enough of these to feel good about people's confidence in capital markets."" If the Facebook offering goes well, it could generate more enthusiasm for other IPOs believed to be in the works, involving companies such as Airbnb, Dropbox, LivingSocial, Pinterest, Spotify, Twitter, and Workday. One thing many young firms have going for them these days: They've come of age in a tough economy, which means they're pretty durable. ""Recent IPOs have had solid management teams or sophisticated financial sponsorship,"" says Leveque. ""They're real companies."" Maybe some of them will even stick around for a while. ick Newman is the author of Rebounders: How Winners Pivot From Setback to Success. Follow him on Twitter: @rickjnewman.

By Barbara Ortutay, AP Technology Writer May 14, 2012 10:17 AM FILE - In this May, 26, 2010 file photo, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg talks about the social network site's new privacy settings in Palo Alto, Calif. Zuckerberg and other executives addressed about 200 prospective investors Friday, May 10, 2012 at a hotel luncheon in Silicon Valley. (AP Photo/Marcio Jose Sanchez, File) NEW YORK (AP) -- He famously wears a hoodie, jeans and sneakers, and he was born the year Apple introduced the Macintosh. But Mark Zuckerberg is no boy-CEO. Facebook's chief executive turned 28 on Monday, setting in motion the social network's biggest week ever. The company is expected to start selling stock to the public for the first time and begin trading on the Nasdaq Stock Market on Friday. The IPO could value Facebook at nearly $100 billion, making it worth more than such iconic companies as Disney, Ford and Kraft Foods. At 28, Zuckerberg is exactly half the age of the average S&P 500 CEO, according to executive search firm Spencer Stuart. With eight years on the job, he's logged more time as leader than the average CEO, whose tenure is a little more than seven years, according to Spencer Stuart. Even so, the pressures of running a public company will undoubtedly take some getting used to. Once Facebook begins selling stock, Zuckerberg will be expected to please a host of new stakeholders, including Wall Street investment firms, hedge funds and pension funds who will pressure him to keep the company growing. Young as he may seem — especially in that hooded sweatshirt — Zuckerberg will be about the same age as Michael Dell and older than Steve Jobs when those two took their companies, Dell Inc. and Apple Inc., public. In his years as Facebook's CEO he's met world leaders, rode a bull in Vietnam while on vacation, started learning Mandarin Chinese and as a personal challenge, wore a tie for the better part of a year. Facebook, of course, got its start in Zuckerberg's messy Harvard dorm room in early 2004. Known as Thefacebook.com in those days, the site was created to help Harvard students — and later other college students — connect with one another online. The scrappy website later grew to include high-schoolers, then anyone else with an Internet connection. Today more than 900 million people log in at least once a month, making Facebook the world's definitive social network. All along, Zuckerberg has shown a maturity beyond his years. As the site grew rapidly and caught the eye of big media and rival Internet companies, Zuckerberg consistently rebuffed mouth-watering buyout offers, including those from Google Inc. and Yahoo Inc. ""Simply put: we don't build services to make money; we make money to build better services,"" Zuckerberg wrote in his letter to prospective shareholders. ""And we think this is a good way to build something. These days I think more and more people want to use services from companies that believe in something beyond simply maximizing profits."" People who've observed Zuckerberg closely say his age is an asset. His is the generation that grew up with social networking, with computers all around them and the Internet as something that's always existed. Many of his employees are younger than him, as are a lot of the up-and-coming technology entrepreneurs with whom he competes. ""I don't think you could build a company like this if you were an old guy like me,"" says David Kirkpatrick, a 59-year-old author who chronicled the company's early history in ""The Facebook Effect."" Kirkpatrick, who is also founder of Techonomy, a media company that hosts conferences on the relationship between technology and economy and social progress, first met Zuckerberg six years ago. He says he was impressed with his vision, even then. ""It's the willingness to take risks, the willingness to abide by a very contemporary vision ... I don't think that he's too young. I think most CEOs are too old."" Zuckerberg, who lives in Palo Alto, Calif. with his girlfriend and a white Hungarian Puli dog named Beast, has matured as a leader with the help of experienced mentors. One of his closest advisers is Sheryl Sandberg, whom he hired away from Google in 2008. Zuckerberg, known for sometimes-awkward public appearances, realized that the razor-sharp, people-savvy advertising executive complements his own shortcomings. Sandberg is Zuckerberg's No. 2, the chief operating officer who oversees advertising and often serves as Facebook's smiling, public face. Then there's Donald Graham, the 66-year-old CEO and chairman of The Washington Post Co., who serves as a mentor to Zuckerberg and holds a seat on Facebook's board of directors. Rebecca Lieb, analyst at the Altimeter Group, says Zuckerberg has assembled a team of ""truly exceptional lieutenants."" David Ebersman, Facebook's chief financial officer, who hails from biotech firm Genentech, is another example. Zuckerberg hired him in 2009, saying that Ebersman's previous job, helping to scale the finance organization of the fast-growing biotech company ""will be important to Facebook."" He was right. Facebook's revenue grew from $777 million in 2009 to $3.7 billion last year. In the first quarter of 2012 it was more than $1 billion. Even so, Zuckerberg still has a lot to learn. As part of Facebook's pre-IPO ""road show"" last week, Zuckerberg visited several venerable East Coast financial institutions wearing his signature hoodie. While Silicon Valley insiders defended his fashion choice, others saw it as a sign of immaturity. Was it, as some speculated, a sign of a rebellious 20-something acting out? For Michael Pachter, analyst at Wedbush Securities, Zuckerberg's attitude and attire symbolizes ""a level of aloofness to stakeholders."" ""He seems very customer focused and very employee focused. I am not sure he cares about anyone else. ... If he's going to go public, he has to answer to shareholders,"" Pachter says. ""That's why Google hired Eric Schmidt. That's why Steve Jobs was ultimately forced out of Apple."" Jobs, in fact, was another Silicon Valley luminary who had Zuckerberg's ear. He was 25 in 1980 when Apple went public. He was ousted five years later after clashing with John Sculley, the former Pepsico executive Apple hired as chief executive. Jobs famously returned to lead Apple in 1997 and the company has thrived since. Not much is known about the relationship Jobs and Zuckerberg shared, but Jobs reportedly told his biographer Walter Isaacson: ""We talk about social networks in the plural, but I don't see anybody other than Facebook out there. Just Facebook, They are dominating this. I admire Mark Zuckerberg ... for not selling out, for wanting to make a company. I admire that a lot."" When Jobs died last October, Zuckerberg wrote on his Facebook page, ""Steve, thank you for being a mentor and a friend. Thanks for showing that what you build can change the world. I will miss you."" Jon Burgstone, professor at the Center for Entrepreneurship and Technology at the University of California, Berkeley, believes that Zuckerberg will need to keep his perspective and continue developing. ""He has already become one of the world's most famous people, and also the richest,"" he says. ""He walks into a room and you can feel people's excitement and the rush to be near him. He's already had time to learn how to deal with such fame and fortune, but now it's advancing to an entirely new level. How will he handle it, emotionally and professionally?"" Lieb marvels at the life Zuckerberg has led so far. Imagine being in your 20s, a self-made billionaire, your life the subject of a Hollywood movie, 2010's ""The Social Network."" ""It's a lifetime and the guy isn't 30 yet,"" Lieb says. He's made big mistakes, especially with regard to users' privacy. One example is Beacon, Facebook's misguided advertising product that broadcast user's activities on outside websites without their explicit consent. Still, he took steps to correct them. On blog posts about Facebook's privacy blunders, he's admitted the company has made mistakes. His 2007 post about Beacon showed his straightforward, methodical thinking: ""We've made a lot of mistakes building this feature, but we've made even more with how we've handled them. We simply did a bad job with this release, and I apologize for it. While I am disappointed with our mistakes, we appreciate all the feedback we have received from our users. I'd like to discuss what we have learned and how we have improved Beacon,"" he wrote five years ago. Facebook shut down Beacon two years later. Zuckerberg has done well for himself so far, but he'll be pulled in many directions once Facebook is public. ""There is going to be a tremendous amount of scrutiny on this company,"" Lieb says. ""Who really is qualified"" to carry such a weight? ____ Follow Barbara Ortutay on Twitter at http://twitter.com/BarbaraOrtutay Stocks slammed!

"Why Mark Zuckerberg Might Be Too Successful In its brief, eight-year history, Facebook has become one of the all-time legendary success stories. But there's still one thing missing from founder Mark Zuckerberg's resume: A prominent failure to learn ... http://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-mark-zuckerberg-might-too-170039566.html Why Mark Zuckerberg Might Be Too Successful - Yahoo Finance Why Mark Zuckerberg Might Be Too Successful May 9, 2012 4:55 PM In its brief, eight-year history, Facebook has become one of the all-time legendary success stories. But there's still one thing missing from founder Mark Zuckerberg's resume: A prominent failure to learn from. [ Photos: Occupy Wall Street: Fighting or Floundering? ] Of course, we'd all avoid failure if we could. But setbacks happen to just about everybody, and they often turn out to be the most instructive experiences we ever go through. ""Ask one hundred people, 'What have you learned from success?' and most of them will just look at you,"" former Coca-Cola president Don Keough told me while I was researching my book Rebounders: How Winners Pivot From Setback To Success . ""But ask, 'What have you learned from failure?' and you'll get lots of answers."" Setbacks usually don't feel so illuminating when they're happening, and some people don't even like to admit when something goes wrong. But just about every business involves some kind of risk, which makes flops and failures inevitable. That's especially true in Silicon Valley, where investors routinely take big risks on startups. As a rule of thumb, about 40 percent of startups funded by venture capitalists fail, 40 percent are successful enough to return their initial investment, and only 20 percent turn out to be good investments that return a healthy profit. And only a fraction of those enjoy the staggering success that Facebook is poised to enjoy in its huge public offering. With a high risk of failure, venture capitalists don't worry so much about preventing it. Instead, they try to spot failures early, so that resources aren't wasted beyond the point of no return. They also intently study failures in order to make sure there's no missed opportunity or new direction that might be more productive. As many investors know, for example, Viagra was initially developed as a hypertension drug that didn't pan out. Only by accident did researchers notice that it seemed to enhance the sexual potency of male rabbits, leading to its development as a treatment for erectile dysfunction. [ See 6 reasons America will rebound .] Savvy investors also value failure as an essential ingredient in the seasoning needed to develop capable business leaders. ""When considering investing in a company, I always ask a CEO, 'Tell me about your failures,'"" says one prominent venture capitalist. ""If you haven't had a failure, you don't have your strength. Somebody who has only experienced success is likely to be so convinced they're brilliant that it never occurs to them they might just be lucky."" Mark Zuckerberg is probably both brilliant and lucky. He's clearly a visionary who figured out new ways to use technology to connect people. He's also lucky he became a programmer just as the Internet became the backbone of mass communication. Talent and luck can be a pretty awesome combination, so it's no surprise Zuckerberg is already a technology titan and billionaire before his 30th birthday. But he may also be a massive case of hubris in the making. Zuckerberg has structured Facebook so that he'll retain an extraordinary degree of control, even after five percent of the shares go public. He negotiated the recent $1 billion acquisition of Instagram almost entirely on his own, over a weekend, with minimal input from his board or other senior executives. Facebook's registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission even states that Zuckerberg and his family and friends can fly on company-financed planes, for personal use, with the cost accounted for as Zuckerberg's ""other compensation."" It's hard to think of another sizeable company so dominated by one person, especially one so untouched by marketplace ups and downs. [ See why Apple could get even bigger .] If Zuckerberg's meteoric success convinces him that he's infallible, Facebook will be in trouble. Richard Fuld of Lehman Brothers seems to have developed a sense of invulnerability, which prevented him from spotting what was really wrong with his firm--and possibly saving it--before it went bankrupt. Rupert Murdoch's sense of omnipotence may have led him to believe his company, News Corp., could break the law and get away with it. Yet the phone-hacking scandal at Murdoch's British papers has damaged the entire company. Many other corporate titans fumbled because they became too convinced that they could do no wrong. Setbacks leaven that type of arrogance. When I was researching , Tim Westergren, the founder of Internet radio company Pandora, told me about the difficulties he faced in two prior careers before he got the idea for Pandora, and the several near-death experiences Pandora had while he was trying to get it off the ground. Those challenges gave Westergren the opportunity to use and build his talents, but they also revealed the limits of his abilities. ""I'm in the church of humility,"" he told me. ""If you're humble, you don't get caught up in the trappings of success, which can be very corrupting for most people. You can get drunk on that if you're not humble."" We now get to see whether Mark Zuckerberg can beat the odds, and stay sober-minded in spite of his gargantuan success.

"Oct 12 2009 	Nice trendy hotel location not too bad.	I stayed in this hotel for one night. As this is a fairly new place some of the taxi drivers did not know where it was and/or did not want to drive there. Once I have eventually arrived at the hotel, I was very pleasantly surprised with the decor of the lobby/ground floor area. It was very stylish and modern. I found the reception's staff geeting me with 'Aloha' a bit out of place, but I guess they are briefed to say that to keep up the coroporate image.As I have a Starwood Preferred Guest member, I was given a small gift upon-check in. It was only a couple of fridge magnets in a gift box, but nevertheless a nice gesture.My room was nice and roomy, there are tea and coffee facilities in each room and you get two complimentary bottles of water plus some toiletries by 'bliss'.The location is not great. It is at the last metro stop and you then need to take a taxi, but if you are not planning on going to see the historic sites in Beijing, then you will be ok.I chose to have some breakfast in the hotel, which was really tasty and there was a good selection of dishes. There are a couple of computers to use in the communal area, as well as a pool table. There is also a small swimming pool and a gym area.I would definitely stay in this hotel again, but only if I did not plan to travel to central Beijing, as it can take a long time. The location is ok if you plan to do a lot of shopping, as there is a big shopping centre just few minutes away from the hotel and there are plenty of eating options around, including restaurants that serve a dog meat! Sep 25 2009 	Great Budget Hotel!	Stayed two nights at Aloft on the most recent trip to China. The hotel was very modern and clean. The room was spotless and a comfortable king sized bed (as far as soft beds go in China). The staff was very punctual and went out of the way to help my every need, including going to a store across the street to purchase a China Mobile SIM card for me. The buffet breakfast was okay, nothing to write home about. The 42” LCD screen had movies on demand for 20RMB and had a good selection of western channels including HBO, CNN, BBC, Star World etc… The gym was small, had a selection of basic weights and one cable machine, there was however 6 new TechnoGym cardio machines with built in LCD TVs which were very good. The location is a bit out of the way to the central areas of Beijing, but it is better suited for my needs as I need to be in the Haidian district. Being SPG Platinum there were no upgrades to a better room, because Aloft has a policy of not doing any upgrades. The Sheraton next door is a much nicer hotel in my opinion (where I am writing this from now, with an upgraded room) but as far as bang for the buck, Aloft is a great place! Aug 4 2009 	Excellent value - location not a big problem.	We stayed at the Aloft Beijing Haidian for 5 nights from July 17 - 22nd. There are lots of reviews that talk about the location being a problem but we knew this ahead of time and found that it really wasn't an issue. The longest we spent in a taxi was about 30 minutes. We never paid more than 50rmb for a taxi ride (which is about $8 Cdn) and that was to the Forbidden City. Given there are 4 in our family, it was no big deal at all.As for the rooms, they were clean, the beds comfortable, the wireless internet connection reliable and it was one of the few hotels we found in Beijing that would accomodate 2 adults and 2 children. We paid about $70 Cdn. per night. That's an amazing price.It's not meant to be a 5 star hotel so you can't go in expecting that. We found the reception staff generally very helpful and friendly. They aren't the fastest in the world but it wasn't unreasonable at all.The hotel manager made an effort to speak with us a few times and was extremely helpful and welcoming. Their breakfast buffet was quite good and reasonably priced. There are a number of good restaurants in the Four Points Sheraton next door so there were lots of options. There is a massive mall about a block away that has other dining options as well.The only issue we ran into was a few taxi drivers refusing to take us to the Summer Palace because I guess they felt it wasn't far enough. The minimum rate is 10rmb. But the staff at the Four Points Sheraton (which is on a busier road than the side street for Aloft) were quite helpful in finding taxis for us if they weren't already there.We would definitely stay there again and recommend it to our friends for its excellent value. Jul 17 2009 	Stylish clean reasonable value poor location	I am glad to be the first person to post photos of this hotel. Key points about this property:- its a starwood property, much cheaper than the rest, and it shows in the pretty incompetent reception staff, the hard bed, the cheap blinds that don't quite block out the sun in the mornings, and common areas which seem to be degrading very quickly (given how new this hotel is).- on the up side, it is very clean and tidy, and if that is important to you, this hotel presents good value. It is also quite stylishly designed and looks much more modern than anything else in this price range.- location is poor for the typical tourist. Yes, very poor. It is not really close to much cheaper the summer palace, and other places will require a taxi, which will probably result in hours of being frustratingly stuck in traffic. Taxi drivers also dont know where it is. If coming from the East, (i.e. city centre or airport) then it is the right turn AFTER the Four Points hotel, which is adjacent. If you are trying to scam an SPG platinum status in the cheapest way possible, perhaps stay in these two adjacent SPG hotels for 25 nights and check out every night.On the whole I thought it was decent value, but dollar for dollar, I would personally prefer to pay double for the Westin in Chaoyang or Financial Street. I have stayed at both at approx. double the price, for real 5 star service. But if thats not in your budget and you want the assurance of an international hotel chain, this hotel is perfect for you.Lastly, this hotel may also be appropriate for university students in Haidian, but don't pick this unless you know what you are doing. Taxis to BLCU or Tsing Hua may be exceptionally frustrating because of constant traffic around Zhong guan cun street. Tell taxi drivers to go on the four ring road, even though it might be a bit more expensive.There is free internet, but it does not seem to work with iPhones. May 30 2009 	Remote but excellent value for money	Stayed there for one night. The hotel is located in Haidian, which is a little bit remote. But if you don't mind taking the taxi to the closest subway station, which costs only 15-20 CNY a ride the hotel represents excellent value for money given its low prices and the modern, quiet and very clean rooms. Also internet use is for free. Especially for travellors who don't want to spend the money for a Hyatt or Hilton but who look for a very decent place to stay this hotel represents an excellent choice. Dec 31 2008 	Good value but not downtown	This hotel is located next to the Four Points Hotel and are both part of the Starwood group. For those wanting a downtown location, this property may not be for you - I recommend factoring in taxi fares in and out of town when working out the value here. On the otherside, the rates for the hotel are very good and the rooms are basic but well appointed. TV was more focused on local channels which may be an indication of the clients they are targeting. There was however the standard HBO, BBC, etc. Staff were very friendly and check in and check out times were acceptable. Jul 20 2009 	???????????????????"
"VERY NICE HOTEL	We get vacation every year after my wedding. But up to now more than four years we work hard and prepare for great vacation for 4 months we choose Asia is our destination First stop in Beijing we stayed in this hotel.Hotel not too big but the room was nice and comfortable. We liked this and enjoyed it. Nov 19 2009 	A fantastic hotel	My boyfriend and I stayed in the Autumn Garden hotel at the end of our trans-siberian railway trip from Moscow and staying there was one of the highlights of an amazing holiday. Staying in the hutong was so much better than an international style hotel, we really felt that we experienced a 'real' bit of Beijing. We loved the choice of english or chinese breakfasts, the room was gorgeous and having free internet was incredibly useful. The location was wonderful too, only 10 minutes walk to Tiananmen square. Sep 11 2009 	nice place to stay	The staff are extremely helpful and friendly, enabling you to find your bearings by providing a trishaw facility to the main road from the hotel. The location of the hotel is a 5 minute walk from Qianmen subway and the furnishings of the hotel rich in tradition. You may not get the western breakfasts you do in more modern hotels but it gives you an opportunity to live like the locals. Dec 14 2008 	Reccomended	This is a great little hotel, I booked this hotel based on previous reviews, so I thought I would come on here and recommend it myself.I went to Beijing on my own for 4 nights to see what its like. It is quite a crazy place, Chinese people seem to take advantage of tourists at every possible opportunity.The Autumn Garden Hotel however is amazing, such nice people, and I consider it a great price for what I got. Its location is great if you want to get a slight feel of what its like living in China.You need to walk down a couple of narrow alley ways to get to the Hotel, but it is very close to Tienanmen Square, with a lot of sites close by, such as the Temple of Heaven and Forbidden City within walking distance. Also there is a touring company with nice and cheap tours (although in Chinese) which is less than 10 minutes walk away next to Tienanmen Square.The rooms are clean and comfortable. Breakfast is simple but decent. The People are fantastic, talk English and are very very helpful. They picked me up from the airport without any charge, Im not sure if this is a regular service, but it was helpful. If it is your first time in China, I recommend getting picked up, as taxi drivers talk very little English if any at all, and the Hotel can be hard to find, Taxi drivers wont know it.The hotel welcomes you very nicely, and give you a map to the area and to the hotel, and even a mobile phone to use while you stay with them.The hotel had everything you should need, but I was truly impressed by the service there which easily allows me to recommend it. In contrast to most of the Chinese which I met who seemed to try and take me for every cent that I had, this little hotel was there for me for every need, without trying to charge me for the help that they offered, or even the things which I expected to pay for such as the half a day late checkout, or airport pick up.If you want a simple, relaxing, and friendly stay, try the Autumn Garden. I will no doubt be staying there again on my next visit. Nov 10 2008	an oasis in Beijing	Just got back from Beijing and a wonderful experience staying in the middle of a hutong (maze of alleyways) in Beijing, just next door to Tian'anmen Square. This inn is truly an oasis in a crazy busy city and right in the middle of what feels like 50 years ago - staff were so welcoming and accomodating - if you want a taxi, they have one - we went to the Great Wall with our very own driver - even had a (very simple) lunch prepared by one of the staff - who were all delightful - lovely courtyard - very quiet even though in the midst of chaos - a real feel for old China - haven't downloaded our photos yet, but willing to share if anyone is interested! Nov 1 2008 	Lovely traditional style hotel	This is a really lovely traditional style hotel, located literally just 5 minutes walk away from Tianmen square as well as lots of eating options &amp; shops. The girls at the front desk were very friendly, helpful and spoke good english. The rooms are very pretty and comfortable, with modern western style bathrooms. Since it's located in the hutong (lots of narrow, confusing alley ways) It's a good idea to take with you the address of the hotel writen in Chinese characters as well as the phone number, so the taxi driver can call for directions. We were given a mobile to use during our stay - and took it with us when we went off to North Korea for a week and then called when we got back, and they sent out a car to pick us up from the station. On our return we also got upgraded to a bigger room. The bathrooms were pretty much the same in both rooms - the sinks make a brilliant nose when you tap them. I booked, as I usually do, on www.venere.com - this is an excellent website and no down payment required. Aug 25 2008 	Living it the Beijing way	As I was looking for accommodation for my visit during the Olympics in late 2007, most of the major hotels were not available for booking for IOC-related room blocks. Which means when I booked it everything everywhere was very expensive. Then I found this little courtyard hotel, and was charged at least 4 times their published rates, yet still I am happy with what I got. Situated 3 &quot;layers&quot; deep from the main streets, you will either need to have good map reading skills to navigate your way to find this on your own... or you could use their free tricycle service which would pick you up from either Qianmen or Hepingmen Quanjude Roast Duck Restaurant.I love the surrounding of this guesthouse. It is a typical hutong where houses are one next to the other, and rather peaceful and quiet. That means it's not the best place to stay if you are expecting upper class and polished streets. In fact, you will find at least 3 smelly public toilets along the way to the guesthouse. But that's what's genuine about the neighbourhood. The location is also quite fantastic... a 5-10 minute walk (or less with tricycle) would bring you to the subway station (Hepingmen and Qianmen), and also Tiananmen Square... that's a big plus for those who like to travel the local way (on foot or subway).Rooms are not big, but adequate, with modern bathroom amenities (good and strong hot showers!). Room rates include free use of internet and breakfast (Chinese or western style, pick whatever you want).You cannot reach this place by taxi, so be ready to have a little hassle when you arrive and depart. The tricycle rider is friendly and could get you to the main streets. I arrived in a chauffeured car and the driver had no clue where it was and luckily I did my research and found the property myself. Although I paid the rate for a 5-star hotel, I wouldn't have done it any other way."
"Dec 24 2007 	Nice property	We booked a three bedroom room for $92/nite, each room came with a queen size bed. Also included was a kitchen with frig and microwave, and a washer dryer. There was also a dining area and living room, where we could sit down at night and go over all the booty collected in a days shopping. While the rooms were very spartan and lacked color, the room was very clean. The location is great and I would highly recommend this hotel to everyone, except Leon Helmsley, who would probably prefer the Astoria. Sep 15 2006 	Great hotel for large groups! (and individuals...)	I traveled to Beijing in June 2006 with 6 friends and we needed an inexpensive hotel that would hold our large group. The Century Towers Beijing hotel was PERFECT. We made a reservation through www.sinohotel.com, which I was nervous about at first, not being familiar with them. The customer service reps were fantastic, responding to all my spastic e-mails quickly and with great care. When we arrived at the Hotel, we breezed through check-in and were given the same price quoted on SinoHotel.com so there were no $$ issues. We stayed in a 3-bedroom apartment-style space (the &quot;large&quot; version offered on the website), with 2 full bathrooms (American Standard fixtures) a full kitchen, and a dining room. It even included a washer/dryer in the unit, though we didn't have any need to use it. The apartment was very clean, air-conditioned, and spacious, even with the 7 of us, we had plenty of room to relax! The hotel is across the street from a HUGE supermarket, so we ended up cooking most breakfasts in the room, saving even more money! We kept lots of cold bottled water in the fridge to take with us on our adventures in the hot, dry summer weather of Beijing. The room included a large flat-screen TV in the living room with cable, and a few English-language channels like the BBC (and the Simpsons!)Other really nice aspects of the hotel include a work-out room in the basement with treadmills, stationary bikes, a rowing machine, ballet bar, free weights, and weight machines. The hotel restaurant is very small but serves good food. The wait staff (and most of China) speak very little English, so learn basic Chinese phrases and expec to smile and point a lot :) We are traveling to Shanghai in the Summer of 2007 and if Century Towers has a location there, we would absolutely stay again! I think the price is much cheaper at this hotel because it's a Chinese hotel, not a foreign chain. We paid about $85 USD/night for this large 3 bedroom apartment-style room. Between the 7 of us, the price was certainly right!"
"Nov 4 2009 	Disappointed	The hotel is out of the city centre, about 20 minutes walk to T Square. None of the taxi drivers I had knew where the hotel was - I had to show them on the map and at least 2 had to stop to ask for directions. The staff were not especially friendly or organised. The staff in the restaurant were not at all welcoming to solo travellers. For 2 nights I was sandwiched between a group of schoolgirls who spent their nights running up and down the corridor sqealing. The hotel shop is vastly overpriced - there is a grocery shop just down the road which is a lot cheaper. I'm sure there are better hotels in Beijing for the same price. Aug 1 2009 	good value	The hotel is a well located good a/c quality 3 star hotel, a fact that should be remembered when evaluating ratings. It is easily accessible to all the places you will want to go. Taxis are cheap as are the buses. Get the hotel to write down the name of where you want to go and take the hotel card with you. Pleasant courtyard to sit around with access to the coffee shop, but beware the price of coffee. Good breakfast in upstairs dining room - asian and american and lunch buffet for $8. There is a good massage establishment in the hotel. Jun 22 2009 	would look at other hotels	This is a very large hotel and caters for large groups but there are only two lifts to manage this large number of people. At peak times its very difficult to get on which is very frustrating. Most of the staff I encountered were far from friendly. My tour guide commented she received a large number of complaints from guests who stayed here. I will say though that the room was roomy and lovely and clean. May 31 2009 	Clean room friendly staff..satisfied	My husband and I recently stayed at the Dong Fang for 3 nights and although we cannot comment on its location--we had transportation organized for our whole stay--I must say the room was clean and provides the basic necessities. My major disappointment was the bed..I love a soft bed and unfortunately the bed was of typical Chinese form--not very soft.As for the staff, they were always smiling and always very helpful. We were content with their level of English.As for the breakfast that was included with our package, it wasn't bad..for all the health buffs, I think it could be a problem but for us it filled our stomachs before a long day of tours, no complaints!Be warned that the walls are a bit thin..was woken up at one point by some noise next door, but it didn't ruin our trip. Something to consider **wink wink**Overall, we had a pleasant stay. Have no regrets considering this was an on the spot choice without any research. Oct 21 2008 	Nice hotel	We stayed two nights and had a nice room, enjoyed the breakfast and also had dinner in the hotels both evenings which was nice and also affordable (we ordered off the menu which seemed to be special as most people had the buffet). The only downside is it is not easy to reach with public transport. We travelled to the nearest metro station Heping Gate station and walked down to Zhushikou East St and walked down a very small side street. To go to the airport we caught a taxi which we preordered at reception. Jul 15 2008 	Comfortable hotel good location	We stayed at the Dong Fang Hotel in Beijing for three nights at the beginning of a China tour. The hotel has a good continental breakfast with many choices, both Western and Asian. The coffee and the coffee shop were also quite good. The front desk was helpful and spoke enough English for us to all understand each other. We found that sitting on the beds made them seem hard, but sleeping on them was actually quite comfortable. The TV received three English-speaking channels. Money can be exchanged at the front desk, and there is also an ATM just off the lobby. We thought the best feature of this hotel was its proximity to Tianeman Square--we were able to walk there in about 30 minutes. Overall, we were pleased with the experience. Jun 27 2008	Loved the Dong Fang!	This was our last stop on an organized tour through Shanghai, Xi'an and finally Beijing. The rooms were comfortable and clean. The staff was very helpful and spoke enough English to successfully communicate with a diverse group of travelers who spoke heavily accented French/German/Russian/Australian/etc. English.Also, the daytime assistant manager is a handsome and charming Jet Li look-alike.Great place-will stay again!Beiing is the best! Mar 29 2008 	Nice New Hotel	We stayed at the Dong Fang for a couple of days as part of our tour package with the Great Wall Marathon (which was an incredible experience, I would recommend to even a non-runner). My impression was that the Dong Fang was brand new and had just opened prior to our arrival. All of the hallways smelled like new carpet and everything, from the lobby to the restraunt to the rooms, was very clean. Most of the employees were also new, working on their English phrases, but on the whole very pleasant and helpfull. After checking in, we walked from the hotel to Tiannemen Square - it was certainly not a short walk, about 30 minutes, but we enjoyed the scenery. We walked through one of the classic &quot;hutongs&quot; and a street market en route. Otherwise, your best bet is to get a cab from the hotel to the more popular sites. The location is the only possible downside. Otherwise, the lobby had a nice little bar, great authentic food at the restraunt, and the rooms were very nice with all the amenties you would expect in a modern, western-style hotel, to include the little soaps and shampoos! Mar 19 2008	great hotel	We stayed at the dong fang hotel in beijing mar 2008 on a organised tour round china .I was a bit concerned after reading reviews on this site so i was pleasantly suprised staff were very welcoming and registration went smoothly. We had a double room which looked like it had just being refurbed probaby due to the olympics and bathroom was of a decent size with all the usual freebies. My only dissapointment was the restaurant food it wasnt up to much but that may have been because we were in a group so had a buffet most of the time so cannot comment on indvidual meals. Downstairs in the lobby was a coffee house which was very pleasant although a little expensive for alchol. I would defineatley reccomend this hotel. Beijing itself was good if not a little drab but the pollution was terrible we all went away with sore throats. How they are going to compete in the olympics is beyond me. Mar 8 2008	Nice hotel a bit far out though	Nice hotel, rooms very modern &amp; clean, breakfast lovely &amp; a good choice, surrounding area is a few shops &amp; restaurants, nice coffee shop in the hotel itself. A bit far out to visit all the sights, we were in an organised tour which was great, but independantly it's a bit far out.Had a room on the 12th floor which was fab, offering lovely views over the city. Fairly quiet as high up apart from the end of Chinese New Year!!! It was fantastic &amp; we were treated to fireworkds and firecrackers all over the city! Feb 2 2008	Average But Nice And Friendly	This was the first hotel we stayed in as part of a trip with Voyages Jules Verne. We arrived on Friday 25th January 2008 and given a room on the 8th floor. Although this was a non-smoking room it did in fact smell slightly smokey as smoking is allowed in the corridors. The room itself was ample in size and I found the beds very comfortable. There was an in-room safe and a decent sized bathroom with powerful shower over the bathtub.The reception staff were all very polite and changing money was not a problem. Their rate was better than back home in England offering almost 14 Yuan to the pound.My only little niggle about this hotel was the fact that the staff in the bar were not consistent with their drink prices. Four gin and tonics and a small white wine cost around £16.00. Each evening a crowd of us (16 persons usually) would meet up in the bar at the end of our sight-seeing trips (usually around 9-9.30pm) and have a few drinks. What I did find annoying was that one night a bottle of beer was 20 Yuan and the next night they would charge 22 Yuan. Ok I know it's only an extra 15p but we were good customers and on average each couple would drink about 12 bottles between them so there was no need to rip us off. By the way the bar closes at Midnight.Directly across the road from the hotel is a small brothel and scantily clad girls would parade themselves in the large glass window touting for business. This was not a problem and they never came into the hotel, but if you are a prude you maybe offended. Our group consisting of various ages did'nt have a problem with this. In fact it was a talking point.It was only when we went to Shanghai during the second part of our holiday and stayed in the Jinshajiang hotel (What a joke) that I really appreciated just how nice the Dong Fang was in comparrison.I have rated this hotel a three, but it probably derserves a three and a half. Dec 24 2007 	Not great	We were booked here for 3 nights as part of a tour. The bed was very hard, could have slept on the floor. Bed linen and pillows smelled of smoke. Hotel staff were not friendly although the doorman was good.Room was not over clean. Buffet Breakfast was good with a range to choose from the buffet.Would not stay at this hotel again. Nov 25 2007	A comfortable place to stay with a good bar	this is a comfortable and clean 4 star hotel centrally located in Beijing although, given the size of the city, it's still a taxi or bus ride from the sights. Friendly staff and a pleasant coffee shop which is in an older part of the building has lots of character. Distant views from the higher floors of Beijing through the smog. There's a good variety of European and Chinese foods for breakfast and the cafe, named 1918 after the date the original part of the hotel was built, doubles as a great bar. Check the address carefully to make sure you have the right hotel as there are a few DongFang hotels as it means “dynasty” in Chinese. Oct 22 2007	great hotel exceeded our expectations!!!	This hotel was where we were booked to stay at the end of a tour and we were a bit apprehensive,but it was great, exceeded our expectations!! We were able to check in at 8am after an overnight train journey from Shanghai.Staff were helpful and friendly although not all spoke fluent. English.The room was spacious, bright and spotlessly clean.Lovely comfortable bed,very modern and clean bathroom(no bathtub, just a shower) with bed linen and towels changed and bathroom toiletries replenished daily.Breakfast was an extensive western and chinese buffet with eggs cooked to order.It was busy but well organised.Insulated jugs of tea and coffee were on the tables.Internet was available from the business centre.Coffee shop was also good.Only problem we had in Beijing was with Taxis.They didnt seem to want to take westerners!!!Other members of our group had problems as well.They would only bring you back to the hotel for a fixed rate of 40 or 50 RMB.When going into the city the hotel called taxis for us several times and the fare was metered, usually 25 to 30 RMB.What will happen in 2008 and the city is flooded with westerners there for the Olympics???? Apart from that we had a great stay.Silk Street shopping centre is great for shopping ,at night we went to Snack Street near Wangfuging Street and as well as shops, one side of the road has loads of food stalls with all sorts of food, cooked as you wait ,a great experience! If you are very brave you can try scorpion!!!!We hope to return to Beijing and would stay at The Dong Fang Hotel again. Jan 20 2007	Ok only	This hotel is ok. It can use a bit of updating. Somewhat clean rooms and bathrooms. Breakfast buffet was quite extensive with both western and chinese styles. Guests were allowed to smoke in the dining room. Internet access in the business center on first floor (RMB1/minute). Hotel is about 5 minutes walk to the Merry Mart Supermarket where you can get your supply of bottled water, snacks and other essentials. There are some non-legal cab drivers hanging out outside the hotel. Be sure to get one who uses the meter. It costs RMB15 to get you from the hotel to Wangfujing street (Tiananmen Sq and Forbidden City). Same vice versa. If the driver quotes you a fixed price, find another cab! They can be quite pushy. The hotel apparently does not discourage illegal cabbies from trying to get customers inside the hotel. Jul 6 2006	The Beijing Dong Feng Hotel	I recently stayed at the Beijing Dong Feng Hotel as part of my Exodus Adventure trip and it exceeded my expectation.The hotel has recently been refurbished. The rooms were large and comfortable. The bathroom was clean and spacious with fresh towels everyday.There was also a buffet breakfast every morning including fresh fruit, juices, eggs, sausages, toast etc and tea and coffee.The staff were friendly and it has a great location. Not far from all the main sights in Beijing. I would stay here again. May 29 2006	Beijing Dongfang hotel was reasonable 	Stayed in this hotel as part of a Great Wall Marathon group. All rooms being totally refurbished and while still 3 star, is good. location is a relatively short walk or a very cheap taxi to Tianemen Square. Good breakfast included in our price. Staff can speak some english. Mar 4 2005	Simple but ok hotel	The Dong Fang Hotel was included in my trip. Lobby is nice. Hotel rooms are simple (outdated) but clean. Employees where friendly, had no problems. Breakfast was simple (in western restaurant). Stayed for one week. Location is perfect, walk in about 30 minutes to Tiananmen Square / Forbidden city. Taxi to centrum will cost you about 1.5$ in 10 minutes from the Hotel. TV with 2 English channels (HBO and ?).Overall: Ok hotel to stay but rooms are simple, if you have a choice maybe go to a higher standard one.R.P. / Netherlands Dec 3 2004	Okay Hotel but hookers everywhere?!	I stayed in the Dong Fang Hotel, Beijing around a month ago (20th October) for several days. The lobby is quite decent initially and overall the hotel seems good, however on closer inspection the hotel is quite dirty, the rooms were not very nice at all. However, perhaps, since this was my first time in China, it is a typical standard there, yet for my British standard it wasn't really good enough.But by no means is it a terrible hotel, and by all means for reasonable accomadation stay there. I did have another problem which was that hookers were everywhere in the hotel, there was a so called 'Karaoke' bar from in the lobby, and a 'nightclub' no the top floor. Yet they were both quite clearly brothels, though once again perhaps this is typical in China but was slightly unerving for me. Oct 29 2007 	waren positiv überascht!!"
"Nov 19 2009 	Pretty good	Very low price, and a decent hostel.Located in the famous hutongs in the middle of old Beijing (like 1-2 km south of Tiananmen Square). A 10+ minute walk to reach Hepingmen subway station. Oct 7 2009 	ideal location for everwhere in Beijing	My wife &amp; I stayed there in September for 2 weeks room 417 in the main hotel. Room quite large and what a relief to have a first class shower. towels and bedding changed regulary.Only down side was storage space for clothing but no big deal. Ask at reception to write down in chinese where you want to go. Also for a card to give taxi drivers to show them where you want to get back to.We thought the breakfast was far to dear. but did not miss it. Food in surrounding restaurants fantastic and so cheap.20 mins walk from Tianamen square if you can resist the temptation not to wonder into the many shops on the way.Then through the square to the forbidden city.Also 20 mins walk from The station at Hepingmen. Train fares 20 yuan (20p UK) to anywhere. Unbelievable! Very easy to use and a tourist train map can be had there for free.We managed to get to most sites by train even though taxis were very reasonable, make sure they put their meters on and beware of any tut-tuts which will trick you ( they say 18 ( £1.80p)and when you get to destination swear blind they said 80...(£8.00p) each)We also took a bus to the Zoo 20yuan and about an hours drive very interesting.I would highly recommend this hotel for a clean room, excellent service ,and helpful staff Ideal for any one who wants to save money for the excellent shopping to be had around. Aug 19 2009 	Good hostel in Beijing hutong	Beijing was my last stop on a three-week trip to China. I stayed at far East for 6 nights and would give it 3 1/2 stars if I could. After staying in a variety of places, Far East seemed adequate, although a bit pricey for the private rooms based on my other experiences. I chose the hotel for its location, which was convenient - near the subway and Tian'anmen (10-15 walk to each). The hostel is located in a hutong, which I really enjoyed seeing. I'm surprised that I saw several comments here about people not feeling safe in the area and being grossed out - hello, it's a fairly poor neighborhood in a developing country. I never had any issues or felt threatened in any way, and there are people still out selling fruit late at night so it's not at all desolate, plus there are several other hostels located nearby. The hotel istelf is fine - nothing fancy, with rather grim communist decor, but cleaned well every day. One negative is that no cab drivers knew where the hotel was, even with the Chinese map. When I arrived, the cabdriver had a difficult timetrying to drive through the narrow streets which were blocked by a bunch of bikes parked in the way. I ended up just getting dropped off on the main drag and walking into the hutong since it was less bother and probably quicker. Jul 19 2009 	Would stay here again!	We stayed here for 4 nights, traveling with another couple and their teenage son. We stayed in the hotel part and found it more than adequate. Rooms were simple but very clean and comfortable, the shower was great, and we all especially liked the restaurant. Hats off to the chef here! The breakfast buffet was very good, but, as with other hotels, we felt the 50RMB was a bit steep considering other meals we had there were more like 18-25 RMB.We booked the 10k Great Wall hike through the hostel....convenient as it leaves from the hostel. (if you're in good shape, don't miss this!)The hostel is within walking distance of many of the traditional tourist sites and we loved the fact that it was located in a hutong area. It's nice that they have several computer areas...lobby, coffee/bar area, and 2 in the restaurant.We would stay here again! Jun 16 2009 	Just what we needed	Great location, clean, friendly, well-priced. This place is not a five-star but a perfect base for exploring Biejing area attractions. Stayed 5 nights with my wife, teenaged daughter and father-in-law. Very comfortable and safe. Good neighborhood with easy access to buses and taxis. 20 minutes walk to T-square and Forbidden City. I'd recommend it to anyone.Didn't try the restaurant as we ate in local cafes for variety. There are a couple of convenience stores next door for everything from cold beer to a ride to the airport. Jun 11 2009 	Cheated	I was greeted by a scowly faced male receptionist who was servicing another guest. That guest had asked him if they had wireless service. The scowly faced receptionist didn't seem to hear or understand the guest''s question so I answered by pointing out to him another traveller who was in the lobby with his laptop. He seemed to have a wireless connection.I thought that if this staff person didn't understand a customer's question in English, then what are the chances of the other staff speaking better English than this guy? Even when I presented my American passport this guy continued to speak to me in Chinese.I also had to book a train ticket to Nanjing for June 9th. Since one staff person poorly demostrated his English speaking skills I decided to try and book a ticket in Chinese. It was June 6th. I wanted to leave Beijing on the 9th but I didn't have the money. I said that I would pay her on the 7th. She insisted that I pay her now. So I went out to an ATM, got the funds, and paid her that day. I thought everything was ok until I returned from sightseeing the next day. I had not gotten the ticket yet and was wondering when I would get it. It was around 7 p.m. when I enquired about this.&quot;You were suppose to leave TODAY (June 7th)at 4;30&quot;What? Bullshit! I said that I was going to pay on June 7th, NOT LEAVE on the 7th. She, however, continued to argue with me and thus blaming ME for giving her faulty information. So I asked for a refund. She called the Beijing Railway Station to see if that was possible. I paid 324 RMB for a sleeper and I really didn't want to pay for another ticket. Unfortunately the train had already left and I could not get my money back.So in my customer review I wrote a loooong note telling management what happened and that I should at least have a partial refund of my hotel stay because of this woman's bad customer service behavior. They read my review but all I got was a &quot;if-you-have-a-problem-come-talk-to-the -manager&quot;response. I never did get my money back. May 21 2009 	Good location more like a budget hotel than hostel	BFEIYH is a hotel that has been converted to a youth hostel. It's tricky to find the first time as it's amidst a Hutong but that certainly has appeal as it gives you a bit of traditional Beijing close by. It's a decent budget option but nothing special.The only thing I would warn against is the agents that work within the hostel. While they are very helpful and friendly, you can easily beat their prices by popping to one of the many agencies nearby for air tickets/trains/attractions May 7 2009 	Good option for Beijing on a budget	The Far East has a hotel and a hostel. We stayed at the hotel. Upon arrival the receptionist wouldn't allow us to check in because she perceived a problem with my husband immigration status. We were really upset because she was rude and wouldn't concede that probably she didn't know as much and the immigration agents of her country who had allowed us into the country at the airport and stamped my husband's passport! Finally we were given our room but only after a long discussion when all we wanted was to go to bed after a transcontinental flight. Later the manager apologized, but still I was really upset. The room was big with two twin beds. No frills. The advantage was that right across the street there was a tour agency which we later found out offered the same tours at a much lower price than the rest of the agencies around the city. So if you're on a budget this is a good option you just need a little patience. Apr 24 2009 	Good Hostel/Hotel	We stayed here for 4 nights in November 2008. We liked that it was really close to Tiananmen Square and that it was cheap (around 30 USD a night). We booked a private double room.The hotel is located in a hutong or an alley. Looks shady at first but it was totally fine. Its great coz youre really close to good food and fairly cheap food at that. The rooms were pretty basic, no frills or anything but has a small TV. There's a bar/cafe/internet cafe downstairs and a convenience store where you can buy water and snacks and such. There was also a laundry facility and a full restaurant in the building. A booking tour agent is also available, which was great, for Great Wall tours, city tours and tickets to Chinese Opera.This is definitely an adequate backpackers hotel/hostel. The only downside I can think of is that it's not really close to the subway station but it is walking distance to the main Beijing sights - Tiananmen square, Temple of Heaven, and even one of the Opera theaters. I'd probably stay here again. Apr 10 2009 	Beautiful place	The hostel is situated within Beijing's traditional hutongs which adds to it's character. The hostel itself had a beautiful traditional courtyard with a friendly atmosphere. The cafe is excellent with a variety of food, I actually got addicted to french toast there! But there is chinese food as well. The hostel is close to one of the main metro lines and has a variety of shops and restaurants near-by there is also bike hire if you can brave the Beijing traffic! It is clean and friendly and the staff all speak excellent English. Jan 23 2009 	really hope this place doesn't change	This hostel rocks!I stayed in the hotel the first night of my stay- called them direct from Japan using the phone number found in my Lonely Planet guide and had no problems communicating and securing a room.However, when I got there the hotel room was fine but a real non-event. I wandered over to the Hostel part of the property across the road and instantly realised that was where I wanted to be... I booked a dorm bed for the rest of the week and moved there the next day.What can I say? I have such fond memories of my 5/6 days at the Far East, I met some lovely people- the courtyard is such a lovely, communal meeting space and everyone there so open and friendly, and you never felt lonely there although if you wanted your own space people were understanding. It was my first time travelling alone and I loved it. My experience in the hostels in Thailand and Europe had prepared me for huge groups of 18 year olds screaming. There was none of that, people seemed a bit older, a lot of people were travelling alone or in couples so naturally a lot more open to making friends.Yes, the area can feel a bit 'run down' but it is so full of character: you can get a real sense of the China that is slowly being trampled upon by the big bucks of commercialism.Liulichang is close by- a beautiful street and the best place to spend your yuan. The amazing book shops have a wealth of chinese pen and ink prints and illustrated books- beautiful gifts or souvenirs. If you carry on down you get to the smaller shops and stalls which sell a variety of stuff, including some of the tourist tat you'll find elsewhere but with a lot more choice and some better quality stuff. The tea shop at unit 88 (hope it's still there) sold the most amazing jasmine and lychee tea. I lost the woman's card and will forever regret it as she said she shipped overseas. Anyone with this info please get in touch.I actually went here in 2004, but I couldn't choose that (understandably).I've heard that this hostel is still standing and doing a great job, but I thought I could contribute my tuppence worth as I really recommend it.Yes, the bathrooms weren't always clean, but apart from that no complaints. Nov 7 2008 	I arrived tried smelly and hungry; I left rested fed and smelling of jasmine!	This is definitely not a hostel. It is a lovely hotel in the most wonderful area in what is possibly the friendliest city in the world.Service was prompt and professional; rooms were spacious, clean and comfortable. The water was hot and the air-con worked.If I ever return to Beijing I will stay at the Far East International Youth Hostel.P.S. Watch out for the tea-house scammers when exiting the Forbidden City… Oct 28 2008	Perfect location and base for exploring Beijing	We stayed there for four days some weeks before the olympics. We could not have hoped for a better location! Smack in the middle of the charming and busy hutong, one of the few hutongs that were open to us (visible, at least, and not destroyed because of the olympic games). And just a short (and exciting) walk to the Tiananmen Square.Our rooms were nice for a hostel, we had everything that we needed. We only got to try the breakfast buffet once (we were to busy exploring the night life to get up early for breakfast), but it was great, with a lot of fresh fruit, many different kinds of juices, and much more.In the immediate surroundings of the hotel, men, women and children were outside drinking tea, playing chinese chequers (or so it looked to us), having a quick wash (!) in the hutong. Fantastic. And restaurants everywhere, with great and cheap food.We originally thought that we could manage everything by ourselves, but still found it a great advantage to have a functional tourist office in the building, where we bought tickets for climbing the wall, acrobatics, and airport taxi. I am definitely staying here if I ever return to Beijing. We loved it! Aug 6 2008 	Luvd it	I was recommended this place by someone in XI'an .I got there and hated the beds but loved everything else.Could not have gotten a better experience into every day chinese life.I ate steamed and fried dumplings every morning down the road and spent all night wondering the allies alone while my girl slept.Safest place I have ever been and the people are great.I would live in this area if I could , and the Hostel staff was jam up and I really love Miss Shen who is in charge of the travel office.I say if you don't mind hard beds , stay here as long as you can .Its near everything too and easy to find being its so close to Tiananmen. Jul 18 2008	Good value nice location (if your taxi can find it)	A good, central choice for the price. Clean, reasonably sized rooms, lobby shop, decent breakfasts, and pleasant basement bar with internet access. The hotel also runs the youth hostel opposite, which has a nice cafe attached. Not sure much English is spoken, but staff did their best to be helpful. The hutong location is very quiet and pleasant, a short walk south of Liulichang and a little further from Hepingmen metro station (and a handy Bank of China branch) - you can walk to Qianmen/Tiananmen easily. The only problem was that despite the map cards issued to all guests, some of my party who didn't speak Chinese had trouble getting taxis to locate the hotel, and some taxis refused even to try and find the place. But I'll probably take my student group there again despite that, mainly for the location and the bar. NB: only cars and motorbikes can get up the narrow street to the hotel, so tour groups using buses will have to carry their bags from the main road. May 15 2008 	Clean rooms great location for a budget price	The Far East Hotel (Youth Hostel) is about a 15-20 minute taxi ride (cab fare Y20) from the Beijing West train station. It's located in a hutong that is currently undergoing some major refurbishment. Don't expect to be walking in the streets dust-free! Check into the main hotel on the right despite the website putting up a picture of the older style building.The twin rooms were clean, the bathroom was a bit slippery when wet. There is no bath/shower partition. Toilet and shower is all in the one space. There was enough hot water for two people. The staff were friendly and checking in was problem free. Just be aware that the card key you get with your room should be facing up with the picture side down.Across from the Hotel is the Traveller's Cafe which is great for breakfast, lunch or dinner. Order the French toast! It's great especially if you've just spent many hours on a train. You can book tours from the hotel. We booked a tour to the Great Wall for (Y300) per person for a private car. No guide was necessary.The hotel is about a 20 minute walk to Tiananmen Square and about a 45 minutes walk to the Temple of Heaven. There are lots to see and explore even in the hutong where the hotel is located. Feb 10 2008	It was ok for the price	It was a decent hotel. It didn't cost a lot so I didn't expect a lot. I thought it was a very clean place to stay. My main complaint was that the beds were literally the hardest beds I've ever slept in. And the pillows badly need to be replaced. Other than that, the hotel staff is decent. Nov 1 2007 	2 week stay in this hotel	What an experience this hotel was. Felt completely at home.I have seen all the different rooms. The cheapest twin bed room, the one I was in, is the best. Small, and really not much to look at, butit’s a place to sleep which is all I'm using it for. I did not find any of my sheets to be dirty as others have complained. Saw maybe some water spots near the AC vents. Bathroom was more like a walk-in shower with hot water at all hours. The room has a fridge and a TV. My only complaint is that the beds are hard and after 7 hours of sleep I would start to feel pressure points and find myself constantly tossing. The so-called deluxe rooms were exactly the same as the standard room except they had a wooden floor instead of a carpeted floor. Waste of money. And the so called four bed room is just a room in the basement of the hotel with bunker beds, so do not get fooled booking one of these because it is a ugly spot in the hotel.The restaurant was awesome. It served Chinese and Russian food. I'm hungry right now just thinking about it. The waitresses and kitchen staff knew when I would come to eat for lunch and dinner like clockwork, so it must have been good. The breakfasts in the morning, however, were simple servings of eggs and ham and cereal and muffins.No bacon and hash brown in China, I don't think. The coffee was good but try the Black Tea as well. Excellent.For the most part the staff was nice. My family in another room had problems with the sink and the staff came immediately to unclog it. I remember during the China new year they came into everyone's room serving people mooncakes. They provide tours, but I didn't look into them. Service in the restaurant was great. The guy who did peoples laundry was easy to deal with. There were a few troublesome staff members, though. There was a girl in the cafe bar below that sighed and gave me a tired look when I asked for coffee. Chinese often wheretheir emotions on their sleeve so it didn't bother me much. (By the way, there is a big screen TV and a selection of DVDs people can choose from in the cafe, which was cool.) One time I asked a staff member to help me find a restaurant I was interested in, but since she didn't know the English name and I didn’t know the Chinese name, she asked, &quot;Why don't you give it up?&quot; So don't expect the best service here, but it sure is not bad for what little you pay for it. (I watched these people put in 12 hour shifts and never seen them having a day off for the two weeks I was there, so I would be grumpy too.)The absolutely best thing about this hotel other than the price is that it is right in the middle of a busy Hutong full of things to eat and buy. Its just minutes away from a bank to cash in travelers cheques and from the Quan Jude Restaurant. You can literally spend a day just walking the old streets surrounding the hotel (some of whichare quite beautiful, just have to look for them) with stores full of art and antiques and statues and weapons and everything Chinese. It is also near Tian'anmen Square, Forbidden City and Tiantan Park. The friendship Hospital is also nearby, which caters to Westerners. A doctor there cured &quot;my allergies&quot; with some herbal medicine (I'm not kidding!) which no doctor here could ever do, so I would make note of THAT on your trip to Beijing. The Wangfujing shopping district is also nearby. Some Taxi drivers will deny knowing where this hotel is, so just tell them to take you near Quan Jude (not even a city block away) and guide them to the entrance area of the Hutongs where the hotel is. Its easy to remember this whole location once you see it. Oct 27 2007 	Great! (considered the price)	Not expensive! Rooms are ok (bathroom can be a little more clean). Everybody (exept clean-lady) speaks english. Close to city highlights. In a really chinese neighbourhood (you have to like it, I really did. You can book all kind of (day)trips in the hotel. Very convenient and not too expensive. Aug 9 2007	A Well Run Youth Hostel in a small Neighborhood	We read good things about this hostel and it looked like our best bet in Beijing. We came in from the train station by subway and headed down the main road from the subway stop. We weren't sure which street to turn down but the residents saw our suitcases and assumed that we were heading to the hostel. Along our walk people made sure we turned down the right streets. It is also a tall building and easy to spot when we got close.  The reception desk was friendly and spoke English well enough. The lobby was quite fancy looking which was reassuring. They has a travel desk which we didn't use (we just used Lonely Planet's advice instead) but it is available.  They have a small shop selling snacks and a good restaurant. The buffet breakfast was not included in the price and was a little expensive by Chinese standards, but it was a huge spread and lots of western dishes if you prefer those. The restaurant has good Chinese dishes for dinner at very reasonable prices. Beer is super cheap and they have movies playing every night. They have two free internet kiosks and wifi is available for free in the restaurant. Just know that a lot of western news sites are blocked thanks to the Chinese censors. We stayed in the 6 bed dorm rooms and found them clean with clean linen and a table to work at. All our roommates were very nice.  We found the hostel very well run, like everything was planned out ahead of time to make it a smooth experience for the visitors. When we went to do laundry there was a girl staffing the room to make sure we could figure out the machine and not break it. The shower rooms were great, lots of hot water, clean and they even have heat lamps over the changing areas so you aren't cold when you get out. One design flaw is that the shared toilets (for the dorms) are all the way down the hall and the toilet paper is kept in the shower room. They need a toilet paper holder where the toilets are! The women's toilet is good but the men's toilet is a bit stinky. They need to remember that men pee all over the floor and it needs to be cleaned more often. Some reviews complained about the neighborhood but we thought it felt safe and the neighbors were friendly enough. Buildings are always being torn down because China always seems to be rebuilding everything. I think if what you are looking for is a very cheap but well run hostel, this place is a great. It is a great pick for those on a budget. In the winter the courtyard rooms are closed (it is freezing) but the main hotel was open and warm (a big plus when the temperature is so cold outside). Mar 4 2007 	Didn`t like that!	there were several good things about that: the central location, not so expensive and the cheap restaurant (which you can otherwise find all over the city). the reception lady could speak English (at least!! after the 4star hotel where nobody could not understand anything in English!) the negative things: not so clean bed shirts, the bathroom was a catestophy! all the water after the shower was on the floor because of the hole in the ground. br... as well, the way to the center, you go through a very poor district, really poor and depressing view.. but.. if these things are not so important to you, then you can enjoy your stay Oct 27 2006 	Great youth hostel in ideal location	We stayed at the Far East Hostel in September 2006.Being my first trip to China and indeed Asia I trusted my travelling buddy wouldn't lead me astray with Youth Hostels. The hostel was located in the Hutongs about 20 minutes walk from Tian'an'men Square and the Forbidden City (where the bus to the Summer Palace also departs from), the nearest Subway is 5 minutes as was Bank of China and there are several tasty restaurants in the vicinity (visit the &quot;Beijing Old Folks Restaurant&quot; for Peking Duck).A double room en-suite cost about 298RMB but I think dorms were available for about 160RMB. Linen was changed every day and fresh towels, soap and toilet paper were provided, breakfast was western style buffet for 28RMB. Internet cafe/bar and restaurant all on the premises.The staff couldn't do enough to help us arrange further accomodation and tours and their travel advisory desk stayed open until midnight, bureau de change available however not for travellers cheques. Oct 19 2006 	Good inexpensive place to stay for a feel of more traditional neighborhood	Booked through hostels.com. Stayed on the hotel side of the hostel (about $30 US/night for two people). No problems with reservation and the property took credit cards (normal for hotels, but not necessarily hostels).Location in a hutong is excellent, but don't stay here if you want a Western location/neighborhood. The narrow street is lined with restaurants, laundries, mini marts and produce markets. Everything you need. Be sure to get oranges if they are in season--they were great. Most travel guides recommend a tour of a hutong while in Beijing. We stayed in one.Location is about half a mile south of the Hepingmen subway stop (walk on the left/east side of the street and turn left at the sign for the hostel--it is in about two short blocks) and you are close enough to walk to the Forbidden City. We had the Rough Guide map of Beijing, came in on the overnight train from Shanghai, and successfully navigated the subway (3 yuan per ride) and half mile walk to the hotel easily. But can see how you can get lost if you don't know which subway stop to get off at. Also, the map on the hostel brochure was helpful to cab drivers, but we usually had to show them the location on a larger city map to orient them as well. The hostel needs to improve the map/directions in its brochure for taxi drivers.Restaurant in first floor of hotel had an excellent breakfast buffet (28 yuan) and good Chinese food for dinner, both very reasonably priced. Price for large (600ml) bottles of Tsingtao beer ranged from 20-30 yuan in hotel basement bar, 5 yuan in hotel restaurant to 2 yuan (25 cents US) at convenience store next to hotel. And the room had a refrigerator to keep water and beer cold.Minor issues - Shower leaked and drained across bathroom floor. Air conditioning was turned off for the season during a warm spell in October--only presented a problem if you sat in your room during the day, which would be silly and we didn't do. Oct 1 2006 	A quirky sort of place	Not the easiest of places to find. It's right in the hutong, so you get see the real China, before they knock it down, but Taxi drivers have no idea where to go. Our one from the station had to ask for directions. Always take a map with you when you leave so you know how to get back. Is within walking distance of Tianamen square and metro though.Another thing, the hostel is either the courtyard across the road from the hostel, or the basement of the hotel(which is cheaper). Basement was a bit smelly though, but was OK, if you stay in the courtyard, you have to take a night walk across the courtyard for the loo. As for beer - buy from the shop in the street for 20 RMB, way cheaper than the hostel/hotel bars and cheaper than water!. Internet is free in the courtyard hostel, so don't pay in the hotel basement. The food was OK in both hotel and courtyard, but take a wander up the street for some good cheap chinese food. The great wall tour to Jinshinlang to Simitai was booked through them as well and worked out fine.Courtyard is definately cool to hang out in and meet people Aug 31 2006 	Stay Away! The Pits!	This is place is awful - don't stay here, don't stay here, don't stay here!The hostel's information makes it seem like it'll be all peaches &amp; roses, but this is hardly the case. It even says if you have a problem with a cab driver to contact &quot;Sally&quot; or &quot;Jason.&quot; Well, I had a tremendous problem getting from the train station to the hostel with a cab driver who wanted to drop me off on the edge of a construction site in pouring rain until I flagged-down a police officer who made the guy take me to the hostel. By the way, this took 1hr because even with a map this place is in an unknown location for cab drivers (Yes, it looks like it's centrally located but it's in a niche that is shantyville).Upon arriving at the hotel I very politely asked for directions to be written in Chinese alongside the map provided online for guests. &quot;Sally&quot; (she's Chinese with an English name) was extremely unwillingly to ask a staff member to write directions. She kept saying, &quot;I think the map is quite good.&quot; Even though, I may sound irate in this review I was completely calm and polite during this episode. Finally she agreed and told a staff member to write some directions. Then she went to the corner of the desk and in Chinese began speaking about me to other hostel employees and pointing at me.The kicker later that same day when trying to get back to the hostel I had to flag down 5 cab drivers before one actually knew the area and even he got lost.The service is completely 100% rude. The next night I stayed at the Sleepy Inn Hostel and I don't even care that I wasn't able to get a refund. There is not 24hr hot water in the dorm-style rooms and the towels provided are frayed and holey (no joke). Also, the bathrooms and bedding has much to be desired. My sheets had faded blood stains on them (probably from a former guests Aunt Flo - nothing grotesque). I can't figure out why people recommend this place. It reminded me of a place prostitutes would go to perform tricks. It's dingy, stodgey, unkept, and the location is awful.It is in a really bad neighborhood and if you're a female traveling alone you will not feel entirely safe walking down the street where the hostel is located. It is an intriguing neighborhood with Chinese setting up makeshift convenience store in their living room and there are many public toliets on the road because of the poor living conditions.My adivce: print off the online map and try to find a cabbie to take you to the hotel to see the neighborhood (quite interesting) and stay at the Sleepy Inn where it's clean.The place is not worth your money. There are much better hostels where you get more for the same amount of money. Mar 26 2006	Highly recommended but hard to find!	The Far East Youth Hostel is a bargain in Beijing. It's right in the hutongs so you feel like you are in the real China but still manages to be quiet and to enjoy an undisturbed night's sleep. It's about 20 mins walk to Tiananmen square.The hostel is also a hotel and this is quite confusing. If you are on a budget, make sure that you ask for the hostel rooms, but we managed to negotiate for a hotel room and only paid 200yuan a night.The room was a very spacious room with an enormous bed, 2 chairs and a small table, a desk, small fridge, a wardrobe and a tv. The bathroom was a reasonable size with a hot shower and western-style toilet. The room was cleaned every day. You can also request hot water to make tea.The hotel has a bar downstairs with internet access (although sometimes you have to wait) and a cheap bar and tv. It also has a small store and travel centre and the staff understand English (essential!).On our last day, we left our luggage at the hotel until 7pm for free.Would definitely recommend and use again. Jun 8 2005	The perfect budget hotel	The Far East Hotel (next door to the Far East Youth Hostel) is the perfect place for budget travelers, and there is no reason to stay anywhere else in Beijing. It is cheap (&lt;$15 US per person), it's clean, the rooms have been remodeled, it's a fun place, great location, and the staff speaks english and is very helpful. They have a great travel agency there and a 24-hour cafe/bar downstairs where you can hang out, watch dvds, or use the interenet (for cheap). There is a restaurant dow"
"Official: New Mercedes Unimog debuts to the cheers of little boys everywhere [w/video] Filed under: Truck , Work , Mercedes-Benz , Specialty , Diesel , Off-Road The Mercedes-Benz Unimog , the superhero villain of the off-road world that's just waiting to make the jump to Transformer, has been completely upgraded for its new generation. There are ten models, expanding the range and getting new designations across the traditional all-terrain series and the implement-carrier series. Panoramic cabins get more visibility, multifunction steering wheels and better dash clusters, improved HVAC and a three-mode central tire inflation system. Outside, there are new items like LED headlights and daytime running lamps in the bumper, roof-mounted windshield wipers and a front-camera monitor for the implement carrier. The new engine lineup is compliant with Euro VI, featuring four- and six-cylinder BlueEfficiency engines putting out anywhere from 156 horsepower to 354 hp. Powerplant placement has also been tweaked, the chassis members getting a revised curve to place the engine a bit further back and lower, maintaining off-road clearance and lowering the Unimog's center of gravity. The new location of the engine means the cabin has more room, and the wheelbase is shorter. Combined with a higher turning angle, the Unimog has a smaller turning radius than before. The implement carrier gets what's called a ""synergistic traveling drive,"" the bonus being that drivers don't need to stop in order to use an attachment - a hydrostatic transmission works with the regular manual transmission at up to 31 kilometers per hour for seamless switching.

Those are just a tiny number of the changes in the new monsters from Mercedes-Benz . You can find out enough about them in the two videos and three press releases below to become a certified dealer. New set-up for Unimog and Econic Strong new image for globally unique concepts - Unimog and Econic: Cleaner, more efficient, more powerful - BlueEfficiency Power engine generation with four-cylinder and six cylinder engines from 115 kW (156 hp) and 260 kW (354 hp) - Powerful and environmentally acceptable: Thoroughly renewed with state-of-the-art drive technology, control concept and cab - Unimog: New unique synergetic traction drive sets new standards in competition - Econic: Up to 4 percent lower fuel consumption - Econic: same payload despite Euro VI World premieres from Mercedes-Benz Special Trucks: A Unimog product range with ten new models at one go – from the Unimog U 216 to the Unimog U 5024 – and 2 and 3-axle versions for the Econic low-entry specialists vehicle introduce the era of Euro VI engines also for special vehicles. All this is combined with an appreciable increase in performance, efficiency and easy operation. Despite the challenges arising from the Euro VI emission standards involving additional components and an increased volume of 120 litres, it has been possible to retain and improve the concept advantages of the two vehicle product ranges. As the new Europe-wide Euro VI emission standards will be valid from 1 January 2014, Mercedes-Benz is rounding off its range of commercial vehicles including the Atego, Antos, Arocs and Actros by launching the two special vehicle product ranges Unimog and Econic to comply with the new regulations. The new engines have up to 90 percent fewer exhaust gas and particulate matter emissions than those used up to now. New structures for the Unimog product range In the new set-up for the Unimog implement carriers, the Unimog U 216 and U 218 replace the previous Unimog U 20 as compact entry-level models and are getting closer to the versions with stronger engines now known as U 318, U 423, U 430, U 527 and U 530. Here the first number denotes the size (for instance 4 corresponds to the current Unimog U 400), the following two numbers stand for the first two numbers of horse-power performance, for example 23 for 230 hp. They are all being launched with, amongst other things, a completely redesigned panoramic cab, new work and power hydraulics systems as well as synergetic traction drive which allows changing over from manual transmission to hydrostatic transmission while driving and all of these innovations make an appreciable difference to the efficiency of the Unimog. The extremely mobile off-road Unimog U 4000 und U 5000 have also been given a more advanced design in important details and are now known under the reference numbers U 4023 and U 5023. For the Econic – the 2 and 3-axle chassis versions now as 4x2, 6x4 and 6x2/4 with electronically steered forward and trailing axles – the concept of the low-entry cab has now been given more potential with a great number of important ergonomic innovations. In addition, it is clearly more cost-effective as it has reduced its fuel consumption and repair and maintenance costs. However the payload remains the same despite the Euro VI. Facing the future efficiently with BlueEfficiency Power Two BlueEfficiency Power model series engines with radically new designs ensure that the Unimog complies with Euro VI emission standards and is also much more efficient especially when using implements as here greater output is available. The Econic has also been given two engines from this generation: engine types OM 934 and OM 936 with three 4-cylinder and two 6-cylinder versions and performances ranging from 115 kW (156 hp) to 260 kW (354 hp) with cubic capacities of 5.1 litres and 7.7 litres. The state-of-the-art drive units combine low fuel consumption with extremely clean exhaust gas and ensure that the Unimog is on the road altogether more efficiently despite the great amount of effort invested in its construction to ensure that it complies with Euro VI. For the Econic it has been possible to achieve up to four percent lower fuel consumption. The engines - already successfully used in the Antos and Atego - are very convincing with their improved output and torque and clearly increased acceleration over the whole transmission range. Despite the Euro VI the fuel consumption of the Unimog has also been reduced. High-tech drive units from a state-of-the-art engine generation The new solenoid injectors with ten-hole jets provide the best possible injection for every working situation. These new, long-stroke engines with cooled exhaust gas recirculation and a specific engine output of up to 33.8 kW/l (46 hp/l) are among the most effective diesel units. The new 5.1 litre 4-cylinder version also produces a convincing top torque of 650 Nm for the entry-level model Unimog U 216 with 115 kW (156 hp) which remains constant over the whole of the main transmission range from 1200 to 1600 rpm. The six-cylinder gives a powerful performance The performance spectrum of the big 7.7 litre in-line 6-cylinder OM 936 follows directly on the heels of the extremely compact four-cylinder version. It is used in both the U 427 and U 430 as well as the U 527 and U 530 and here for both versions with 200 kW (272 hp) or 220 kW (299 hp). This means that the Unimog has been given top-level motorisation. The best torque result lies at 1200 Nm for the 1200 to 1600 speed range. The Econic has been fitted with 6â??cylinder engines providing an output of 220 kW (299 hp) and 260 kW (354 hp). Economy of space on compact chassis Great importance was also attached to economy of space when complying with the exhaust gas cleaning standards required by Euro VI which comes into force on 1 January 2014. This was a task which faced the designers with demanding challenges considering the compact chassis of the Unimog vehicles and also the low-entry concept of the Econic. In addition to the recirculation of the exhaust gas inside the engine, cleaning the exhaust gas also involves a system comprising the oxidation catalytic converter, a closed particulate matter filter, AdBlue injection and an SCR catalytic converter connected in a series. - END - New set-up for Unimog and Econic Unimog U 4023 and U 5023: Setting standards for off-road mobility - Perfection off-road, better handling with centrally-positioned engine - New BlueEfficiency Power Euro VI engines with higher output and higher torque - Chassis concept with torsionally flexible frame, torque tubes and coil springs retained - Strong and reliable, many details improved - New engine power take-off with increased applications The outstandingly mobile off-road Unimog with its new reference numbers U 4023 and U 5023 as the follow-up models for the U 4000 and U 5000 is now more environmentally acceptable and efficient, but still just as mobile off the road as its predecessors and even stronger – that means better all round. It is fitted with the new four-cylinder BlueEfficiency Power BlueTec 6 engine with an output of 170 kW (230 hp) and a strong torque of 900 Nm. The Unimog transmission has been improved and uprated so that the gear changing times are shorter with an increased life span. In future the gears will be changed using the pitman arm on the steering column and this also includes the electronic quick reverse function (EQR). As up to now, there are eight forward and six reverse gears available as well as the optional crawler gears for off-road use with a speed range between 2.5-35 km/h. The main difference between the two big Unimog vehicles lies in their axles and frames i.e. their axle loads and the gross vehicle weights which is a maximum of 10.3 tonnes for the U 4023 and 14.5 tonnes for the U 5023. Time-tried cab with a short bonnet radically reworked This cab is first class – it has left its mark on the appearance of the outstandingly mobile off-road Unimog since 1974. The designing engineers were confronted with the challenging task of installing technology complying with Euro VI and they succeeded by repositioning the engine one metre further back under the cab and this is now the core of the new concept. In comparison with its predecessor, the new cab has been lengthened by 120 mm and is slightly higher – and by moving the transmission controls from the central console to the pitman arm on the steering column there is much more space in the interior of the cab. This cab has also been upgraded with its new fittings: The multifunction steering wheel, adjustable steering column, pitman arm control, multifunction touch-keys and instrument cluster with a large display as well as a new stronger heating and ventilation system provide the very best conditions for the driver. The central tire inflation system ""Tirecontrol Plus"" has been redesigned so that the correct tire pressure for the prevailing conditions can be chosen simply and easily in the display with the pre-programmed modes ""road"", ""sand"" and ""bad surface"". From the outside the dynamic design of the radiator and the new bumpers with modern headlamps show at the first glance that here there is a new generation of the Unimog on the job. Also the access to the cab is completely new with easy to master and safe steps, two or three depending on what the customer requires. The altered position of the engine also allows power to be taken directly from the engine with an engine-driven PTO so that implements can be run independently of the driving situation unlike the transmission-driven PTOs which are still available. The big advantages of the extremely mobile off-road Unimog such as its outstanding handling over tough terrain remain untouched and in individual points its strengths have been improved. In the new model, the curving of the frame is now further back due to the central position of the engine and altogether the Unimog has a lower centre of gravity while retaining its high ground clearance which is extremely important for off-road operations. As both frame and tubular cross members are welded, this guarantees the extremely good torsional flexibility of up to 600 mm when driving cross-country. The axle articulation of up to 30° is made possible by the torque tube technology combined with the coil springs by connecting the torque tube and the torque ball to the transmission. Portal axles, the low centre of gravity and extremely good angles of approach and departure (at the front 44°, at the rear 51°), and ramp angles (34°) as well as its slope climbing ability (45°) all go to make the outstandingly mobile off-road Unimog just what it is – and in addition there is its fording ability of a maximum of 1200 mm as well as its side tilting angle of 38°. Driving in extreme situations is supported by the engageable all-wheel drive, engageable differential locks and the central tire inflation system. Unimog vehicles have a long life and they are robust and reliable. The completely welded frame and the enclosed parts of the chassis stand for the claim that the vehicle is able to stand up to great stress and strain. The axles are reinforced, all important power units and equipment are metal clad or installed in safe positions – and this is also true for fording ability within the guaranteed depth of 1200 mm. Extreme operations the world over All this shows quite clearly just why the outstandingly mobile off-road Unimog has such an excellent reputation all over the world. Working in extreme off-road conditions is the order of the day, whether it is fighting forest fires, for disaster control, crane operations, pipeline construction, expeditions, rescuing man and machine and last but not least for transporting crews and other people – in remote areas where the roads turn into bad tracks and rough terrain, that is where the Unimog U 4023 and U 5023 are on home ground. The Unimog is also looked after perfectly as far as maintenance, trouble diagnosis or repairs are concerned as competent Unimog Dealers are there to take care of the vehicles in over 650 service stations in more than 130 countries where special service packages and financial services round off the customer care. - END - Unimog U 216 to Unimog U 530: New powerful implement carriers - New entry models Unimog U 216 and U 218 - Work and power hydraulics - World premiere: Smooth changeover from driving with hydrostatic traction drive to manual transmission precisely designed for the job - Unimog versatility: Over 1000 implements and applications The product range of the Unimog implement carrier launched in 2000 is now being presented in the second generation with a new arrangement and new designations. U 216 and U 218 as entry-level models and the U 318 and U 423 are fitted with four-cylinder engines, U 427, U 430 and U 527 as well as U 530 have six-cylinder units. As the end of very work-intensive design engineering, the Unimog implement carriers are now once again at the starting block – more efficient, environmentally acceptable and cost-effective than their predecessors and in addition with their typical features greatly strengthened. New exterior: Panoramic cab with a modern design The panoramic cab presents itself in a new and modern design. Here the optical and functional effect of the short bonnet is emphasised even more by LED lamps including daytime running lamps integrated in the bumpers. To improve visibility, the windscreen wipers have now been fitted on the roof over the windscreen giving a superb view of both road and implements, and improved even more through the new front camera monitor system. Typical for the Unimog: The front power take-off reveals its powerful technology and power-hungry implements. New interior: Operating concept provides the best working conditions Multifunction steering wheel, adjustable steering column and stronger heating and cooling system with improved air flow make both drivers and co-drivers feel happy. The operating controls have been improved so that there is now a steering column pitman arm to operate driving functions such as gear changing or engine brake. The instrument cluster for driver information is new and has a large, light display; the joystick for operating implements can be removed and held in the hand; the uninterrupted view of the front implements – which is also important when attaching or removing them – is made safer with the monitor and front camera; and all this adds up to an appreciable lightening of the driver's load. Using the central tire inflation system ""Tirecontrol Plus"" (optional) is now much easier via the display as it gives the user the choice between pre-programmed modes ""road"", ""sand"" and ""bad surface"". New work hydraulics – more sensitive than ever The new work hydraulics set to precisely and without making any jerking movements – with at the same time about 30 percent increased hydraulic performance. This makes is possible to control the implements more sensitively than ever before. The work hydraulics is completely proportional when working and allows two movements to be performed at the same time via the joystick. The multifunction keys on the steering wheel and the display allow the output to be limited. The hydraulics works with two circuits, whereby Circuit I provides 200 bar system pressure with hydraulic oil flow of 32 l/min, together with Circuit II it adds up to an additional 55 l/min with up to 240 bar. And here the implement drive has been improved even further as the front power take-off now gives a performance of a maximum of 160 kW (up to now 150 kW). New compact entry models: Unimog U 216 and Unimog U 218 The two entry-level models U 216 und U 218 are completely new. They replace the previous Unimog U 20 and are now very little different from the bigger implement carriers above them starting with the U 318. Models U 216 and U 218 also have the same panoramic cab including the adjustable steering column and the other innovations, as well as the well-known unique VarioPilot where steering wheel and pedals can be moved to the other side of the cab when the operator needs to work from the co-driver's seat. The great advantage of the new models is their size with extremely compact dimensions. The wheelbase is only 2800 mm and is thus 200 mm shorter than the U 318, the turning circle is only 12.6 metres in comparison with 13.7 metres – by the way both of these turning circles are what are to be expected of passenger cars. Power is provided by the four-cylinder engines with 115 kW (156 hp) and 130 kW (177 hp). With three different load ratings from 7.5 to 10 tonnes, the payload of the U 216 and U 218 can cope with a great variety of tasks and applications. Unimog U 318 to U 530 Even greater performance, more manoeuvrable, more agile and able to do many more different kinds of job: such an all-round increase in efficiency is the trade mark of the Unimog U 318 to U 530. The engines produce a new peak performance as the 220 kW (299 hp) in the U 430 and U 530 provide the strongest hp output ever realised for a Unimog. The advanced work and power hydraulic systems profit a great deal from the engines. Greater efficiency is also provided by the greater payload. Here it was possible to reduce the weight by making savings on the frame and using aluminium wheels. It was also a brilliant feat to be able to shorten the wheelbase by 80 mm in comparison with the former U 300 despite the complicated components needed for Euro VI (U 318 and U 423). Because of this and with the help of a greater turning angle when steering, the turning circle is clearly smaller than that of its predecessor. New power hydraulics replaces power take-off pumps and special purpose body engines Power hydraulics VarioPower – for a long time this name has been behind the extremely powerful implement drive in the Unimog. Now it is even more efficient. Two circuits, each with 125 litres of hydraulic flow and 280 bar pressure can perform, if required, several different kinds of job at the same time or one especially sensitive operation – up to a top performance of 58 kW per circuit. This advanced design replaces pumps attached to the power take-off or diesel body engines, for example for mounted sweeping machines and this saves fuel, space and weight. And if the power hydraulics is not needed, then the Unimog can save weight in the vehicle frame – it can simply be removed from its installation location to increase the payload. This new system is operated using steering wheel touch-keys and its data can be read in the display in the new instrument cluster. The power hydraulics is available in Unimog models from U 318 on. The new synergetic traction drive The innovative new hydrostatic traction drive for the Unimog implement carrier is also a world premiere and it opens up a whole new range of possibilities for using implements. The combination of hydrostatic and manual transmission allows the driver to change smoothly from one mode to the other while driving. Up to now it was necessary to halt briefly before changing systems. The new comfortable Drive-Work-Mode can be used to advantage, for instance, when mowing grass verges and the work is interrupted by a long noise barrier. The new hydrostatic drive now allows speeds up to 50 km/h (31 mph) and the hydrostatic performance has been increased by 20 percent. Whereas infinitely variable driving and working reduces wear on the clutch and increases work performance, driving with the manual transmission saves fuel because of its increased efficiency. When using the electronic pneumatic power shift (EPS), the driver starts the changeover by pressing the clutch and so starts the optional automatic electronic drive control (EAS) to complete the changeover automatically. This new synergetic system is easily operated by using the steering column control switch, hydraulic joystick or alternatively the accelerator. Unimog implement-carrying design: More than a 1000 different possibilities The versatility of the Unimog implement carrier is legendary. In the meantime, more than a 1000 different possibilities are registered. Implement manufacturers worldwide work together intensively with Mercedes-Benz Special Trucks at the Wörth plant - where the Unimog now has its base – to expand the range of operations. The great advantage of the Unimog product range from U 216 to U 530 is its ability to use implements four-fold. There are three attachment points – front, rear and between the axles – as well as the space for mounting bodies and equipment on the chassis. The implements and equipment can be supplied with energy hydraulically, mechanically and electrically. The range of users includes Local Authorities, the energy sector, forestry workers, agricultural logistics, the construction industry or road-rail operators, but the list is long and includes many others. Whether it is working at the airport, cleaning solar parks or clearing snow across the mountains, virtually nothing is foreign to the Unimog and that it is exactly what makes it unique in the world of commercial vehicles - as a versatile implement carrier with the driving qualities of a truck. It also proves its value as a tractor unit with a 40 tonne combination and its technical top speed of up to 90 km/h (56 mph) is absolutely suitable for motorways. Directional stability, precise steering and the use of ABS are responsible for the high level of safety provided by the Unimog. In addition, the extremely good axle load distribution and four same-size wheels have a positive effect on the vehicle's handling qualities. And the Unimog sets its very own standards with the panoramic cab. The panoramic front windscreen, deep drawn down side windows and short bonnet give a very wide view of driving and working areas. What is quite new is the front camera system with a monitor which makes things easier for the driver as it shows him the area directly in front of the vehicle which makes it easier to attach implements. And last but not least, it is the good off-road mobility of the Unimog which speaks for itself: portal axles, high ground clearance, differential locks, single tires and the ability to rock out of dips (Electronic Quick Reverse). As far as servicing, trouble diagnosis or repairs are concerned, the Unimog is well provided for with over 650 service stations in more than 130 countries worldwide where competent Unimog Dealers are ready and waiting with special service offers as well as financial services to round off the entire package.

"Dec 2 2008 	Love it Love it	I stayed at this hotel for one night in November. The person who booked this hotel told me that it was recently remodeled right before the Olympics. With $90 a night, I was more than willing to give it a try. It's off the crazy 3rd Ring road (San Huan), so traffic seems moderate. US and Japanese embassies are within walking distance. There is a food street adjacent to it. I did not get a chance to explore it. It can be an interesting place to get a bite if you are tied of the hotel menus. I had a single room with a king size bed. Not huge space, but plenty room for what I need. It's well decorated, modern and hi-tech, and smells clean too. The bed is very comfortable. Sheets and towels show very little use. The LCD TV has many international channels, American, French, German, Russian, Japanese, Korean, Australian ... plus many more I can't even recognize. The breakfast was only okay, not a huge selection compared to what I had elsewhere, but not bad either for 80 yuan. I changed American dollars to local yuan at its business center at an incredible rate 6.795 while other hotels usually gave me 6.4 or even lower. Overalll, to me, it is a smaller version of Hilton, just one block away across the street. You only pay half of Hilton's price. I will definitely stay there again next time. Oct 21 2008 	Great value great hotel all around	When I booked this hotel, I had some pretty low expectations knowing that in China sometimes you get exactly what you pay for, and often even that ratio is a stretch. What a pleasant surprise I had when I got into my room, it was absolutely clean and perfect for my business trip. I had stayed at the intercontinental hotel a few weeks before in Beijing for literally 5 times the price of the Guangming, and the room was almost exactly the same. The stigma of Chinese hotels has finally been reversed, long live the Guangming... The lobby was clean and 5 star-ish, the service was excellent, but the rooms were exemplary and this hotel is certainly one I'll go back to for all of my business trips in the future. Booking with Ctrip gave me some sort of special on free internet in my room which was another little bonus of this place. The only annoying thing was the breakfast, which though edible was certainly not anywhere close to the intercontinental. But then again, with the money I saved I made sure to treat myself to a nice brunch at a nice brunch spot in the embassy district. A good hotel all around, and its a great location, check it out and thank me later."
"Oct 9 2009 	Excellent location for walking/exploring and fabulous breakfast for China!	h my nine year old daughter and would normally overlook hostels, but I was drawn to this one by the reviews and location. The ensuite with two twin beds was small but convenient, with cozy duvets and cable TV. (Also includes an electric water pot and tea, a chair, desk and side table.) For $37 US, it was a very good deal, especially in all the hubbub leading up to the 60th Anniversary. The bathroom had a strong sewer smell (welcome to China; it's pretty normal) and the one extra electric outlet was broken, but it was generally clean and the public areas were immaculate.The hostel is tucked in a quiet alley not far (maybe one block) from a bus stop. (Catch the #2 on the same side of street as the hostel to head to Tiananmen East/ #1 subway line or Qianmen/ #2 line) It is nestled between the Forbidden City and WanfangJie, the walking &amp; shopping street. It is also just a few blocks from the Night Market (tasty and exotic treats - from candied fruits to grilled lizards and seahorses), which runs from about 6-10 pm nightly. My daughter is pretty tough for 9 and we walked all over the city, but the front desk will also help arrange taxis or the information room attendant can help with travel logistics. They also have several tours they'll sell you (expensive compared to using public transit, but competitive prices compared to other tour operators). We opted for public transit and had a blast (and total solitude!) at Great Wall Simatai. We walked to the Forbidden City, to JingshanYuan (2 kuai, highest point in the city with a bueatiful temple that looks straight down on the Forbidden City), Bei Hai Park (20 kuai, with 5 kuai ferry rides across the lake and plenty of cultural relics and nice park areas) and all around T Square. We also used the subway often, which was crowded but easy to navigate and VERY cheap (2kuai per single journey).We were gone all day every day, so took advantage of the safe lockers by the front desk - 1 kuai each time you lock it but well worth it &amp; big enough for a computer and small personal items.We stayed several days and enjoyed the breakfast - the best I've seen in China, even in the fancier high dollar hotels. It always had a couple of Chinese dishes (spring rolls, noodles, fried rice,) either scrambled or fried eggs plus boiled eggs, croissants &amp; jam, veggies and dressing, meusli and fresh yogurt and fruit. The breakfast area and reading room are nicely decorated in traditional style, and don't forget to try on the Emperor/ Empress suits in the Information room and get your photo! (Take your own photo, but donning the suits is free.)There is a supermarket (turn left outside the alley, about one block on left) with plenty of fresh fruits &amp; veggies and even some western niceties (lunch meat &amp; sliced bread - even wheat!) without the upscale import prices. There's decent wireless internet in the lobby, and I was sometimes also able to pick it up in the room. It's free, but I believe there's a small charge for using their computers in the internet room.Overall, the staff was really friendly but not necessarily very helpful. They speak some decent English and run to help you with taxis, but if there is a problem you may get the Asian shrug-off. With the great location, breakfast, and moderately nice facility, I would certainly stay again and recommend it to friends. Had I not had my daughter, I would not have opted for the ensuite - save yourself the stink and get an even better deal for a fabulous location! As always, take ear plugs just in case! (I never needed mine.) Aug 20 2009 	Great place to stay	Really affordable with friendly staff. Located about 10 mins from Forbidden City which is a must see attraction. Handy supermarket a couple of doors down, with really cheap water and other food stuffs. If you opt for breakfast as a extra it's a little expensive compared with food everywhere else at 30Y , but is an all you can eat, we enjoyed the museli. The information office here are really helpful and can book tours along the great wall etc. and train tickets, they found us cheap flights to Hong Kong. Jul 29 2009 	Jade International Youth hotel	Excellent budget hotel with all the facilities that you need. In walking distance for shopping and most of the major sights.Would recommend to anyone. Jun 10 2009 	Good value in great location	Friendly staff, secure and pleasant facilities, right in heart of historic area. While there are more exotic and charming hostelling locations in the city, this facility is a well-run hotel-like option (as opposed to siheyuan/courtyard house option) within 10 minute walk of the east end of Tiananmen Square. However, being halfway down a long alley, it is not a well-known hotel nor is it an easy location to describe to a taxi driver.Free WiFi in the lobby is a nice amenity. Hostel staff took my heavy rolling luggage and escorted me into the lobby when I first arrived--better service than expected! They also watched the courtyard to ensure those who entered were residents or had business there.I was pleased with my three night stay. Apr 9 2009 	Exceptionally Good	We booked just the one night here due to time constraints.The service was excellent - polite, efficient and informed.We were surprised by quite how good the en-suite twin room was. This is only supposed to be a hostel but it is 3-star hotel standard.The location is excellent - close by the Forbidden City and a leisurely 15-minute stroll down to Tian'anmen Square. The nearest metro (Dengshikou, I think it was) is about 10 minutes walk away (once you realise that it's quicker walking down the alleys) and the nearest bus stop is about two minutes away.The amenities are very good - reception, restaurant and tourist office.We liked everything about this place.If you require very comfortable accommodation in a very central location with very helpful staff then this place is it - at an unbeatable price. Feb 18 2009 	Love this hostel :)	This hostel is so cool. Staff are all friendly and nice. Clean rooms. Wi-fi access in lobby is very useful. Location also rocks. Rates are very affordable. You'll be amazed when you see the rooms. If you'll go to Beijing, I will suggest that you stay here. More value for money? Stay in this hostel :) It's also near food strip. Nov 2 2008 	Hotel standard rooms...	Rooms here are small, but clean. We stayed in a standard room with private ensuite. TV in room. Comfortable bed. Room is cleaned daily, and towels, soap, toothbrushes etc are provided. Chinese style bathroom: no partition between the shower area and the rest of the bathroom. Good location: 10 mins walk to Forbidden City or Wangfujing shopping street. Free bike hire with 600 RMB deposit. Free wireless internet in the lobby and bar area. Otherwise you can use their computers for 1 RMB for 6 minutes. Huge common area with TV, stereo and couches and books to read.Can be a little noisy at night, so bring ear-plugs if you are a light sleeper. Reception staff are very helpful with directions etc. Washing machine and dryer facilities available for a fee. They provide a free pick-up service from Beijing Railway Station if you call in advance. We took the Airport Bus from PEK (18 RMB), then jumped in a cab to get to the hostel. Cab driver got lost, so we had to put him on the phone to the hostel. Buffet breakfast is 35 RMB. Eggs, onion rings, toast, croissants, fried rice, noodles etc. Ok, but not fabulous. Apr 16 2008 	Loved the fish tank	Booked accommodation through a language school - stayed for just over two weeks. I have never stayed in a youth hostel and didn't know what to expect this experience was a good one. I had a room on the third floor, twin for single use with shower room(standard). I didn't have any problems with noise, just the occasional late returner to hotel at weekend and that can be the same in any hotel. The hotel was refurbished about two years ago. The shower room is modern with pretty good fittings, tiled floor modern toilet (a toilet to sit on is not always found in Beijing) hairdryer and regular supplies of toilet paper, towels changed every day. Bedroom is part tiled and part wood effect flooring. TV and kettle provided with a couple of T bags every day. Lighting in room is OK but if you like reading in bed take a mini light. The hotel has a lot of English speaking staff - some have the minimum few words others a pretty good command of the language and they battle with the dozens of accents they come across every day. Comfortable seating in the reception area try to be there when they feed the fish with other tiny live fish. Seating area in the bar with big widescreen TV with DVDs available. Food and drink prices are reasonable, bar food is mostly western style and aimed at backpackers/students. Its not bad though and I believe Chinese food is available but I'm not sure when because I never managed to be there. Breakfast buffet is now 35 yuan. Food OK. Tea and coffee arrangements are hit and miss. Take your own tea bag and ask for hot water. Coffee isn't bad if it is hot. Internet access is not wireless so if you have skype etc you need the right equipment pay at reception and then find your allocated PC. The hotel is clean, well serviced and the staff are friendly and helpful. The hotel position is great for walking to sights - it won't suit you if you want a subway station on the doorstep. No problem if you understand the bus routes or are prepared to walk (about 15 mins). The hotel has the required cards to show taxi drivers to get you to the tourist areas or back to the hotel. If you are going to use the taxis a lot get someone in the hotel to write out the address in large print. Lots of the taxi drivers just need to wear glasses for reading! If you find a good taxi driver try to get their card and get a quote for anything you want to do farther afield. 3 or 4 people in a taxi to the wall is cheaper than an organised bus trip and you can get their earlier before the crowds.Beijing is safe to walk around, the area is residential so you won't see that many people late at night but it's OK even as a lone female. The people in the hutong close to the hotel are pleasant and used to the guests tramping through on the way into the centre. Bikes can be rented and tours/cars to airport can be arranged by the hotel. Changing money at reception is actually cheaper than using an ATM. Security boxes available 1 yuan per use. Dec 10 2007 	Great Budget Accomodations	I booked a private room at this youth hostel. Having stayed at hostels before, I can say this was much better than most, if not all. Clean, all the amenities you could ever want or need, and you can't beat the location. Dec 2 2007 	Great location - friendly staff and clean	Myself and my girlfriend stayed at the Jade Youth Hostel for a few nights while passing through Beijing. The location is fantastic - only a few minutes walk from the Forbidden City.Our room was very clean. Staff spoke decent english. Staff also booked our train tickets to Xi'an and a tour to the Great Wall.I would definately recommend this hostel if staying in Beijing. It looks more like a hotel than a hostel - so not so cozy - but definately comfortable.Rgds,GPS Sep 3 2007 	Beijing Jade international youth hostel	I booked this hostel through (--) (v good website that contains unbiased reviews from travellers)I stayed in the Beijing Jade Youth Hostel (part of international hostelling)address is No.5, North Zhide Alley, Beiheyan Street,, Dongcheng District costs 75Y (=£6) for one bed in a 4 bed dorm for one night (shared bathroom outside of room). They also have 6 bed dorms and twins with ensuite.It is very smart, clean, light and airy for a hostel. You can also get a breakfast buffet for 25Y and the nice communal bar area does food throughout most of the day. They have a tourist info office and you can arrange tours to great wall etc.I found it to be in the best location compared to othe hotels and hostels. It is walkable to forbidden city, tiannmen sqaure, main shopiing street, night market. Beijing is a very pread out city so be prepared to walk alot.Best way to get around is by taxi (cheap) - beijing is a very speard out city so be preparedt o do a lot of walking.I took the shuttle bus from airport to just opposite the department stores on Xichang'an jie - you can then walk to hostel = 40 min or take a taxi for 30Y.I was a single female travelling on my own and found it to be a safe city. Just be wary of young people coming up to you posing as struggling art students who then take you to their art shop and conn you into buying paintings that are a lot more exp than what you can get in the market. Also be careful of the rickshaw drivers. I had an experience where i wanted to go from A to B and I bartered for a price before hand. He then took me on a long tour of the backstreets with historical facts and then demanded a lot more money!English is spoken by very few and those few only speak it to a degree so best to always have a map in english AND CHINEESE so you can point to where you want to go as taxi drivers tend not to speak english.It is a facinating city on the verge of change as they are preparing for the 2008 olympics. Lots of construction work going on! Apr 3 2007 	Superb buget accomodation in Beijing	I have been teaching in China for seven months now and I have stayed a total of nearly 40 nights at the Jade Youth Hostel. The rest of thetime I live in a City some two hours away.If your looking for something cheaper than the hotel chains, the likes of Novotel etc, but something better than a typical YHA Youth Hostel, this place fits the bill. Everything about it is superb. From the friendly staff, spottlessly clean reception, great bar, tasty restaurant to the clean and comfy rooms. Located just 5mins walk from The Forbidden City, this gives you an idea of its great central location. For the cheapest way to book, go via www.hostelbookers.com or one of the similar sites. You get it slightly cheaper than paying at the front desk, though at the prices they ask, its not much at all! For a single bed in an 8 person dormitory - Y50. A single bed in a 4 person dormitory - Y60. Neither are en-suite, instead they share a shower room and toilet room. Both are cleaned very regularly, and are spotless for the majority of the time. Above that, a private double en-suite costs Y200 for the room. Having stayed in all of them, I would advise the 4 bedroom dorm over the 8, only because it can sometimes get a little noisy with people coming and going from the 8 person. The private rooms are ideal for those wanting a little more privacy.There is a tour agent within the hostel, where it is possible to book taxis to the airport, visits to the Great Walk and other City tours, all of which I've tried and found perfect.There is an internet bar that does what it says on the tin, cheaply (5Y for 30mins). The Bar / Lounge is very popular. A chill-out place to watch movies during the day, and a great place to warm up before going out on the night, with beers a mere Y4 and table football. There are some other hostels nearby that I have heard good reviews from too, but the fact that I never felt the need to go elsewhere on one of my many visits speaks for itself.The easiest way to get there is to jump in a taxi, call the front desk of the hostel, and get them to direct the taxi driver. Simple and easy. Apr 24 2006	Sound sleeper?	While the hotel had great prices (cheaper booking online in advance) and the rooms were adequate it's quite noisy. Not only are other guests yelling at each other in the thin walled hallways (they do have shhhh please signs posted to no avail), but one morning the employees were even on their walkie-talkies at 5:30am with the thing buzzing back and forth. If you're a light sleeper, it's not great. The rooms are on the small side but good enough for two of us, the shower is part of the bathroom so the whole floor gets wet, most of the hostel type part is spread out so there isn't that meeting others feeling. The taxi had to call them twice on the way from the airport to find them but they are located within walking distance of a few places and it's easy enough to get a taxi at the end of the street, even at 5:30 in the morning! We'd stay again, it wasn't awful, it just wasn't great. Nov 17 2005	Beijing Jade Youth Hostel - Great budget accomdation	We stayed at the Beijing Jade Youth Hostel (Address: 5 Zhide Beixing, Beiheyan Dajie) in Beijing in September 2005 and we would highly recommend it to anyone looking for cheap but decent accomodation in the city. I think we paid around US$15-20maximum for a double room with ensuite. They also have dorm rooms available which are much cheaper... Nov 17 2005	comodo e assolutamente dignitoso"
"Oct 25 2009 	New hotel with great rooms and great price.	I stayed at Ragegast Beijing for one night in Beijing. The rooms are top notch, easily comparable if not better than hotels in Beijing for double its price. Overall, no complaints. If you don't mind a not so fashionable part of the town for a great value, I would recommend it. Sep 8 2009 	Postive surprise!	A typical Chinese 5-star hotel. In measures and meters and facilities the hotel has everything what a 5-star hotel should have. On the other hand it is all very Chinese. Not always do the things function, the staff speaks a little tono English, so ifyou try to explain something it takes a bit more creativity. What was a pitty that there is no nice hotel bar and all restaurants close already at 10pm. The way the hotel is furnished and the size ofthe rooms are fantatstic. Also location is excellent. In fact quiet but very central. Much nicer to stay in a Chinese 5 star hotel then the well known international chains. Would come here any time again. Apr 29 2009 	First class hotel	After the Beijing Olympics we stayed in this beautiful hotel, which we had found on-line. We soon noticed that it was brand new with a few growing pains but a spectacular property with accommodating and helpful staff, beautifully appointed rooms and gorgeous bathrooms! At first we were uncertain about the location because it seemed quieter than anywhere else we had stayed in Beijing but soon learned that the neighbourhood was classy, young and had much to offer. Apr 28 2009 	I can't believe they treat guests this way	When I searched for a hotel to stay for a family trip to Beijing, I found many reviews. When I read about Radegast I decided I would stay there, especially since most of the reviews were quite favorable. However, after 3 nights of no air conditioning and mentioning this each day, nothing was done to fix the problem. It is not unreasonable to expect those in the hospitality industry to remedy issues. This leads me to the conclusion that I will not stay at this hotel again! The first day we alerted the staff to the problem (which they said they’d fix) and when we returned that night it wasn't fixed. The second morning, we again reported the issue to which they said they would &quot;fix&quot; the problem. Again the hotel did nothing other than to make promises and treat our complaint as less than serious. Finally, on the third morning, we asked for the manager. At this point, they told us that they would move us, to which we declined. At this point it was too late and they could have done the first night to another room. However since we were leaving the next day, we were not going to pack, settle in to a new room, only to repack to leave the next morning. In our opinion, it was pointless. Why did it take 3 days to be taken serious? Our hotel room temperature was between 25 and 27 Celsius during which the weather was around 28 Celsius outside. In fact, the manager blamed the lack of air conditioning on the temperature outside. The manager even argued with us that if we opened the unscreened windows that it would have been cooler in our room. Is this how guests should be treated? During this conversation, we continued to complain, this time more vocally, that this shouldn't matter and they were just not going to not solve the problem. We received the usual &quot;apologies&quot; but without any satisfaction. This for a $300 a night room!!! They wouldn't refund nor do anything to remedy the situation. This is rated a 5 star hotel and yet do not handle complaints with seriousness nor treat their guests with any dignity. Our rooms were very uncomfortable due the temperature and I don’t think that this is a minor issue. My 75 year old father in-law’s room was the same. If you are contemplating this hotel, my advice would be to go elsewhere. If you should have any issue with the hotel, they will dismiss your complaint and you will have no recourse. Mar 1 2009 	Smart modern and new	This is another excellent, new facility in Beijing. The rooms are spacious and well-appointed with excellent facilities. The complimentary buffet breakfast was of a high-quality, with swift, low-key service. The hotel is within 10 minutes walk of most CBD buildings and the nearest subway station. While not as conveniently located as other hotels in the area business travellers should find its location acceptable. Tourists may find its location less ideal for their needs. Given that it offers nothing more than other hotels in the area, I'd chose it over others largely on the basis of price. Feb 12 2009 	Very Nice But	Very impressive hotel with great rooms with many amenities. Loved the soaking tub with the mirror / TV. Everything about the rooms and the hotel appearance are top notch. Stand up shower has overhead sprays and adjustable body spray. Hotal has a very nice spa with swimming and workout facility. The workout room is a little small and limited but more than enough for my limited exercise when on business. Hotel has 4 restaurants all with good food but the prices are a bit high. You can get a better meal for a lower price just walking a few blocks or taking a cab someplace. Would recomend Hatsume which is across the street for shushi or Machioni's (probably spelled wrong) which is just a block away on the 2nd floor. For the cost I would highly recomend staying because it was in my opinion a great value. Some of the Butt'sHotel HVAC is eaither set to heat or cool for entire hotel Therefore depending on when you stay you can only make the room temp higher or lower but you don't have the choice of which one. We stayed in Feb and the room's were 80 degrees and there was nothing to be done since the building was set to heating. We tried opening windows but this did little to help. I'm sure for some times of the year this isn't an issue but it was a major issue for us. SPA / Fitness Center hours are not condusive to working out in the morning. Brochures said it opened at 7:00 the front desk told us 6:30 but it actually opened at 8:00 and we had to be at work by then. It also closes promptly at 10:00 so if you get back late from a business dinner there is really no room to workout. The people working the SPA were over attentive. Maybe in some cultures this is very nice but personally it was past creepy having people always around you and ushering you from the front desk to the locker rooms to the locker and trying to help you undress. This was anything but relaxing for me. I would have been much happier being handed a locker key and let to go on my way and if I need help just have someone around I can ask. I had a massage and the actual service was very good (though expensive for China) and as soon as she was done I was ushered out of the room to the locker room and then to the front desk by several different people. They could really take some leasons in how they could create a better more relaxed and enjoyable enviroment. Staff is very friendly but still working on their english skills. I didn't have an issue with this some of the guys I was satying with did. Just know if it's something you require. Hope this helps. agan hotel appearance and the rooms outstanding jsut have an issue with the temperature control and spa/ workout facilities. Dec 28 2008 	Love the Radegast	I first stayed at Radegast for a business trip, and I liked this hotel right away during this trip. So now every time I go to Beijing, I stay at Radegast. It is a very modern, comfortable and well-managed hotel in the center of the business district of Beijing. The location is very convenient. I stayed at other five-star hotels in Beijing before, but I prefer Radegast the most.  The hotel staff is very friendly and their services are superb. Check-in is speedy. The concierges are very helpful, too. Every time I go to the airport from the hotel, the concierges help me find my airline's terminal number and tell the taxi driver. The hotel rooms are extremely clean and cozy with modernized lighting systems and electric curtains. The hotel has five fine restaurants that offer various delicious cuisines from Chinese to American to French. I personally like their French restaurant the most. It's French cuisine is very authentic. Their indoor sunshine swimming pool is fabulous. It's a big swimming pool with a constant warm water temperature. The pool attendants and gym staff treat guests like kings. You have to try. The hotel is also very close to several big shopping centers, such as Shin Kong Place, and many local restaurants. All within walking distance. Overall, Radegast's location and services are excellent. I like this hotel and would definitely recommend this hotel to my friends. Dec 20 2008 	Great stay !	We stayed in Radegast hotel for 6 nights in the end of September. the rooms were absolutely dreamy, specuosly clean, and very pampering. we got a great price from Hotels.com, 65$ per night, and this was defenitely the best hotel we stayed in for such a price (anywhere in the world). we were a little afraid since the hotel seemed to be far from the city center, but as soon as we got to China we realized that taxis are SO cheap, and the city is HUGE, so 5 minutes by taxi and 12 yuan, and we were right in the city center. so this is by no means a disadvantage. Oct 19 2008 	A 5 star potential	The Radegast was the first of two five start hotels that we stayed in while in Beijing (the other was Marriott City Wall) from 10/5/08 thru 10/17/08. In general, this hotel was great, but a bit on the unfinished side given that it was only operational sometime in 8/08. Let me start with the location. Our first impression of the location was a bit negative, it didn't look like there was much around the area; however, after talking to some staff members and exploring a bit, we found out that there was actually a great deal of conveniences located within walking distance of the hotel (e.g. Walmart-- to get water, do not drink tap water in China, small fast food Chinese style restaurants, high end shopping malls with very nice restaurants). There is a subway stop (Guomao Station) approximately 15-20 min walk. A closer station is under construction. The hotel doesn't look that impressive from the outside; but once you get into the lobby, it's another story. You will be greeted at the door by the hotel's door person immediately and whisked away to the front desk. The lobby is full of marble columns and glass made adornments. The room was also quite luxurious with very modern color scheme and theme, flat screen TV built within the wall, very soft sheets, a lounging couch, a formal business desk, very impressive bathroom (with a TV). For whatever reason, the bathroom has a glass wall that can see to the living area of the room (an electronic curtain is used to create privacy). The hotel features 5 restaurants, a business center, a spa, an awesome pool, but a small gym. The quality of the service from the staff was 10 out of five! They were extremely courteous and professional. On one particular occasion, I left my guidebook in the cab. I asked one staff (concierge—Eddy, young guy in his early 20’s) to call the cab company on behalf of me to query about this. He not only did so, but he actually made arrangement for the cab driver to return my guide to the hotel. But I was only able to communicate this with my broken Mandarin as Eddy spoke very little English. Although the service was very courteous, it could be to the extreme. For example, when you go to the gym, two staff members, will greet you at the entrance and personally walk you to the gym. Another staff will follow you around the gym. Now the extreme part comes when I went to take a shower after using the steam room. A staff member actually asked me if I wished to let him put on my clothes! I’m not kidding. Needless to say, I politely refused. I think a lot of the staff was told to treat the customers with extreme luxury and some staffs (perhaps from the country side) interpreted this to treat guests like emperors. The restaurants looked really impressive; but a bit on the expensive side. One that we tried was the Radegast Food Bazzar (3rd floor), it serves local snack foods but made by expert chefs and served with a silver spoon. The taste was amazing. Some of the negatives include: there were two exposed nails left from construction in the bathroom. Although they were not in any dangerous location, it was definitely an eyesore. The quality of the air in the hotel did not seem very clean. It still had some construction odor, but I suspect this will be gone with time. They simply do not have ice for whatever reason, including ice machines on the floor (I think this is universal in China, they don’t like cold things). The fan in the bathroom was a bit loud and can not be turned off unless you turn off all the lights in the bathroom. The use of the business center was very expensive but if you have your own laptop to use in your room, this will not be a problem since they have free wireless internet in the room. Another possible drawback is that this hotel was designed for the business traveler, which overlooked some family necessities like having a drawer in the room. The staff members were extremely cordial and helpful but still in training and by no means able to efficiently communicate in English. Lastly, going back to the location, since it’s a new hotel, none of the taxi drivers knew how to get there. You should ask the concierge to write very clear and specific directions, including landmarks for the taxi driver (e.g. near the new CCTV building, the weird looking cube building which is walking distance from the hotel). In sum, you can tell that the hotel was somewhat unfinished but with great potential. You will be treated like royalty which generally makes up for some of the drawbacks of the hotel. In addition, it is highly suspected that the drawbacks are only temporary. We would definitely stay there again and highly recommend this hotel to friends (without kids). Sep 3 2008 	Decent hotel great service	I stayed at Radegast Hotel CBD Beijing for a short business trip. The hotel is located in Central Business District in ChaoYang district in Beijing, on the same road as the new CCTV building. It's about 10 min walk to the new upscale mall in Beijing, XinGuangTianDi (????), where there's a subway station. Therefore, location-wise it's good. But since it's a new hotel, not many cab drivers know about it. So you'd have to tell them to go to the CCTV building and drive from there for another 1 min down the road.From the outside, the hotel looks rather ordinary, and it's not huge. But on the inside, the hotel looks extremely luxurious. It is a five-star hotel, but since it was newly built and there was quite a bit of vacancy during the Olympics season, I got a 50% discount, so it's actually the same price as a 2 or 3 star hotel in the U.S.. Back to the inside- its main hall is amazing, with gold and marbles, its elevators has leather interior, the hall ways are nicely carpeted, and my deluxe room is huge, with guest reception area, 40 something inch flat panel TV, shower and bath tub separated, and there's another TV for the bath tub. The bathroom was bigger than the NYC studio I used to rent. The lighting and mechanized curtains were sophisticated, but the curtain switch didn't work. The electric wall jacks were new, but my plug didn't fit in properly. The bathroom door was newly finished but couldn't close entirely. So the hotel is new, but a bit unfinished; luxurious, but not always functional. (reminds me of many other things in China).The service is great. I needed an iron, a U.S. compatible plug, and have my safe box opened on separate occasions, and the service lady came pretty promptly and was very helpful. Not sure if she speaks English though. She looks like someone just from the countryside, down-to-earth but not internationally professional.Overall, I'd stay there again given the price, location, level or service, and a chance to satisfy the pretentious part of me that wants to project an image of living in a five-star hotel, intentionally avoid looking too deep beneath the surface.

"Oct 9 2009 	Very comfortable and very good location	Central Beijing accomodation. Comfortable clean with a standard Chinese service. Jul 28 2009	Very nice spacious.	The apartment that we stayed in was nice, and very large. There were 3 of us in an apartment with 4 single beds. The only real complaint was the beds were very hard and there were no utensils provided to cook/eat with despite there being a stove and fridge. Apr 25 2008 	Shabby hotel shonky management - avoid like the plague	My Chinese friend and I booked a two bedroom apartment with a double bed and two single beds.Upon arrival we were given an apartment with four single beds only. We complained to reception, who told us they didn't actually have any apartments with double beds. When we pressed them further, they admitted that they do have such apartments but had given them to other people (despite our booking). The carpet, beds and bathrooms were also in decidedly shabby condition, so we wanted out.Reception told us we could cancel without charge, but we thought it best to confirm this with the hotel site we had booked through.Various phone calls followed as we spoke to the customer service line for the site, who in turn spoke to the hotel, who in turn spoke to us. Meanwhile we also rang some places to find a different hotel in the same area. Eventually we found one, made a booking, and were relieved we wouldn't have to stay in a shabby place with the wrong bed configuration.But then came the snare. Our complaints and phone calls had, apparently, taken just over one hour, and the City Hotel informed us that, although we had not yet used anything in the apartment (not even the toilets), it was their &quot;policy&quot; that we would have to pay the first night's accommodation, because we had been in the room for more than one hour. They were willing, however, to &quot;negotiate&quot; this down to 100 yuan.Right...so we spend one hour trying to sort out THEIR failure to honour our booking, and they want to charge US for it? I've never heard of anything so shonky in my life. It was only through some very heated discussion and raised voices down at reception that were were eventually able to get back our deposit and leave without charge.Does anyone really want to stay at a shabby hotel with a management that fails to honour people's bookings and then tries to charge them for the hotel's own mistakes? Shonky, shonky, shonky. Jan 7 2008 	Awful. Stay away far far away.	was supposed to stay here for two weeks but cut the stay short after I just couldn't take it anymore.no proswhat made it that terrible?:no real lock on door. (see photo) someone kept trying to enter while I slept--only chain kept them out, but you can still see in.no one speaks English.there was cigarette smoke everywhere. (EVERYWHERE)staff encouraged strangers to sit with you at breakfast. (who would smoke and blow it in your face while eating)in order to reach the street access it was necessary to walk through major construction and what smelled like open sewage.I have never felt this awful traveling. Truly it was disgusting. Oct 10 2006 	City Hotel - Fine Hotel - Close to the action of the bars subway 	Stayed there while my apartment in Beijing was being fixed. Not 5-star, but better than many Beijing hotels. Next door to several good pubs, close walk (0.5km) to the subway and easy to get taxis for work meetings. Clean room and friendly staff made for a good stay. Also next to several great local restaurants that cater to foreigners. Subway is a great way to get to Tiananmen &amp; the forbidden city, Military Museum, and it's the fastest way to the west side of the city due to the huge traffic on the ring roads. If you want a no frills good room for a reasonable price, pick the City Hotel (Chung Shi Bing Guan in Chinese - all the local taxi drivers know it!)"
"the disney studios has its formula for annual , full-length animated features down so pat that it's hard to remember which one you're watching at any given moment . "" mulan , "" their 36th animated adventure , is the latest case in point . once again we have a tale focused around a strong central character ( female as usual ; disney is one of the few studios whose heroines--ariel , belle , pocahontas , and now mulan--get equal screen time with their heroes in recent years ) . add the requisite love interest and a wise-cracking sidekick or two , pep up the soundtrack with a handful of strategically placed show tunes ( an introspective number by a pool or looking in a mirror , a rousing anthem , a cutesy , montage-backed crowd pleaser ) , pose a few threats to our engaging lead , and tie things all up neatly by the closing credits . bob's your uncle ! better make that walt's your uncle . . . kids will no doubt go ga-ga over "" mulan "" ( or at least the fast food tie-ins ) , but familiarity can , after a while , leave grown-ups--this reviewer included--wishing for a little more . maybe an animated feature without--shock ! horror ! --the songs , for example ? or maybe a film in which a cheeky chihuahua called pepe longs to become a matador from trinidad ? ? how about simply ditching the sidekicks altogether ? it isn't gonna happen . like disney's previous entries , "" mulan "" is slow to make its mark . the animation tends to suffer from some slackness in the early going and the humorous element , a madcap dragon wannabe ( in the guise of a loquacious lizard with a case of dry mouth , courtesy eddie murphy's animated vocal talents ) , plays like an inappropriate if necessary ( formula-wise ) afterthought . however , after about an hour everything comes together and the formula , like it or not , clicks . highlights include a spectacular cavalry charge on a snow-covered pass ( which , due to the sophistication of today's computer-generated imagery , is hard to tell from the real thing ) , a memorable , show-stopping musical interlude ( "" i'll make a man out of you , "" penned by matthew wilder and david zippel ) , and last but not least , mulan herself . voiced by ming-na wen , mulan is disney's strongest female character to date . when hordes of huns pour over china's great wall and threaten to overthrow the imperial palace , the emperor decrees that every family in the land dispatch one man to serve in the imperial army . since mulan's father is infirm , but proud , the high-spirited mulan steals her father's armor and , incognito , signs up to face the mongolian menace . attracted to , but not distracted by , her commanding officer shang ( b . d . wong ) , mulan outmatches her fellow combatants in smarts , wit , and physical ability . she's a woman of the '90s a couple of millennia ahead of her time ."
"disney's 35th animated feature-- a retooling of the olympian legend crossed with , well , the superman story-- is surprisingly soft at the center . great wit , great art , and a great villain ( james woods as hades , lord of the underworld and local lounge act ) can't quite stifle the yawns induced by a bland hero , his colorfully monotonous sidekick ( danny devito as the satyrical trainer phil ) , and a largely unremarkable soundtrack . ( none of the alan menken/david zippel tunes are particular- ly noteworthy . some lack lyrical snap . others need more memorable melodies . boring ballads we expect , but boring production numbers , too ? ) so , hercules is a bit of a long sit , but you won't stay bored . the highlights include a nifty round of animated action ( herc battling a cgi hydra ) , a steady stream of anachronisms ( "" somebody call ix-i-i "" ) and pop references ( "" let's get ready to rumble ! "" ) a la aladdin , and several long-overdue jabs at the mouse's marketing and merchandising depart- ments . while not as rock-solid as hunchback , it's a still a new world of improvement over pocohontas . directed by ron clements and john musker , with voice credits including tate donovan , susan egan , bob goldthwait , matt frewer , samantha eggar , paul shaffer , and , as lighting bolt zeus , rip torn , who's having a very good summer , also appearing in trial and error and men in black ."
"the computer-animated comedy "" shrek "" is designed to be enjoyed on different levels by different groups . for children , it offers imaginative visuals , appealing new characters mixed with a host of familiar faces , loads of action and a barrage of big laughs ( including numerous gags related to body functions and yucky substances , apparently a requisite in contemporary family films ) . for adults , it's a fractured fairy tale packed with rude jokes that will sail over the heads of the kids . all in all , "" shrek "" is a snappy ride , although there are a couple of points i found disturbing . but first the basics . based very loosely on a 1990 children's story , "" shrek "" follows several momentous days in the life of the title character , a rotund green ogre voiced by mike myers in that pleasant scottish accent he is so fond of using . shrek is a grumpy fellow living a solitary life deep in the swamp , until a local nobleman disturbs his peace . petty tyrant lord farquaad ( take away the "" awk "" in the middle and you have the basis of a string of impolite one-liners ) owns the land on which shrek resides . he proceeds to turn the ogre's yard into an ellis island for storybook characters when he banishes the fanciful beings from his castle . as a result , shrek finds himself surrounded by legends like the three blind mice , pinocchio , the big bad wolf , the seven dwarfs , and the three bears , to name but a few . an enraged shrek storms to the castle , only to find farquaad ( john lithgow ) ready to bargain . lord obnoxious wants to become king and the magic mirror from "" snow white "" has shown him the way . all he has to do is rescue a damsel in distress and make her his wife . the mirror unveils three choices in a presentation straight out of "" the dating game "" ( when snow white is shown , the cheeky announcer purrs , "" even though she lives with seven men , she's not easy ! "" ) farquaad selects the lovely princess fiona ( cameron diaz ) and offers shrek a deal : if the ogre snatches fiona from the dragon-protected , lava moat-filled castle in which she is held captive and brings her to the throne , the lord will allow the fairy tale pests to move back on his grounds . shrek reluctantly agrees and sets off on his quest , accompanied by a motor-mouthed donkey ( eddie murphy ) determined to make the green grump his best friend . they finally hook up with the princess , only to learn she is not the helpless maiden they expected to meet . for the matter , the dragon offers a few surprises as well . the movie references a great many other flicks , from "" babe "" ( "" that'll do , donkey . that'll do "" ) to "" the graduate . "" but the lion's share of the jokes come at the expense of the wonderful world of disney . the public-domain characters made into icons in various disney films take their hits ? pinocchio is referred to as a "" possessed toy "" and when shrek spies a sleeping snow white in his cabin , he bellows , "" get that dead broad off the table ! "" ? but the biggest slams come when shrek visits farquaad's royal domicile , which closely resembles a certain magic kingdom , from its souvenir stands and queue lines to a display of animatronic figures that sing the palace rules in a relentlessly peppy tune that sounds a lot like "" it's a small world . "" which brings me to disturbing point number one . i laughed at all the disney swipes , but found the mentality behind them a bit sad . the acrimony between dreamworks honcho jeff katzenberg and disney big wheel michael eisner is well known . for years the two companies have tried to sabotage each other's film and video releases by issuing similar competing productions on the same day . and now we have katzenberg using an entire movie to attack his former employer . here's a suggestion for the two boys : grow up ! put the past behind you ! there's room in the sandbox for both of you and if you farquaads can't play nice , then go to your rooms ! the other area i found troubling came in the portrayal of lord farquaad . beyond all the irreverence , "" shrek "" actually has a message : people should learn to look beyond physical appearances , because true beauty lies within . it's a lovely notion , but the film betrays its own moral by incessantly taking cheap shots at farquaad's diminutive stature . do we really need a family film reinforcing the idea that mocking short people is acceptable ? the pompous , selfish behavior of farquaad is enough to make him a target for zingers . adding short jokes is simply mean . still , "" shrek "" is a rollicking good time . the computer animation is mostly impressive ( although several key characters look like animated rubber squeeze toys and the human movements are often jerky ) , the voice work is strong ( particularly from eddie murphy ) , the laughs come fast and furious , and the moral , tainted though it may be , is a good one . to trot out a clich ? , "" shrek "" is fun for all ages . parents , though , should remind their young ones during the ride home that taunting others because they are short , tall , skinny , fat , etc . is a bad thing ."
"why do so many children's films treat their target audience with utter contempt ? too many of those who write or direct for children's movies assume that the kids just can't handle serious , thoughtful discussions on meaningful issues . "" the iron giant , "" which was directed and co-written by brad bird , late of such animated series as "" the simpsons "" and "" king of the hill , "" assumes that not only can children handle such discussions , but that they can do so while being entertained at the same time . "" the iron giant "" holds absolutely no contempt for the young people in the audience , making it a film that's enjoyable for both children and adults alike . hogarth hughes ( voice of eli marienthal ) is a spirited young lad who lives with his hard-working single mother , annie ( jennifer aniston ) , in a small town in maine . after staying up late and watching scary movies on a night his mother is away , hogarth treks out into the forest to investigate what has stolen his antenna and ruined his tv reception . he comes across a giant robot ( vin diesel ) from space that eats metal for food . after saving the robot , nicknamed the iron giant , from electric shock , hogarth befriends the creature and takes him in as a pet of sorts . because of damage he suffered upon landing , the giant has forgotten what his original mission was , so he just follows hogarth around like a lost puppy . realizing he can't just keep the giant in a barn all the time , and that the giant needs food , he takes him to a junkyard owned by dean ( harry connick jr . ) , an eccentric artist who assembles sculptures out of scrap iron in his spare time . it soon becomes apparent that dean and hogarth can't keep the giant a secret forever , because a government spook named kent mansley ( christopher mcdonald ) has been brought in to investigate mysterious sightings in the surrounding forest area and considers the giant a threat to national security . he suspects hogarth knows something about the giant , and takes up residence in hogarth's house as a lodger . meanwhile , the giant begins to exhibit ominous behavior that suggests he was built to be a weapon of some kind . "" the iron giant "" is exactly what family films ought to be , because it doesn' t talk down to its audience . the story is simple , very simple , about an alien being that drops out of the sky and befriends a young boy . it's very similar to the spielberg classic "" e . t . , ' and such comparisons are actually deserved in the case of "" the iron giant . "" the film holds many of the better elements of spielberg's film , such as the ability to be sentimental without turning sappy . the film delivers several serious messages , the most important of which is one's ability to choose one's own fate . hogarth teaches the giant to go against his programming and become what he wants to be : a hero . the final sequence is touching and appropriate , though i won't give it away , i will say that very few will be disappointed . the animation , while not up to disney standards ( what could be , after "" tarzan "" ? ) , is good enough to make you forget you're watching a cartoon . the giant is computer-animated , while the human characters are all hand-drawn the old-fashioned way . the characters' faces are done quite well , drawn realistically enough to make the personalities credible , but the features are exaggerated so as to allow for the cartoonish expressions that provide for comic relief . fine voice work is turned in by young eli marienthal as hogarth , and jennifer aniston is surprisingly convincing as his waitress mother . harry connick jr . does a nice characterization as dean , and i really enjoyed the voice work of john mahoney ( of tv's "" frasier "" ) as an army general called in by agent mansley . unlike several cartoon features , each character is actually a developed personality , rather than a stereotype , and is actually integral to the plot , rather than being a superfluous comic-relief sidekick ( a clich ? disney still hasn't ditched ) . dean , for example , could have been a stereotypical beatnik ( his character profile seems to suggest that ) , but he is presented as a character with real emotions , thoughts , and motivations . even the heavy , agent mansley , is not a villain who does bad things simply because he wants to , but out of his own fear and paranoia . a lesser animated feature would have drawn up paper-thin stereotypes and figure the kids won't mind , but "" the iron giant "" has clearly put a little work into making the characters real , and it pays off . the film isn't only around to deliver heavy-handed messages , though . it's also very funny , and the humor is of the kind that both children and adults will enjoy . the scenes in which hogarth teaches the giant to do certain things , such as dive into a pool , are handled well , and director brad bird clearly has a sense of comic timing , having worked on "" the simpsons "" for many years . a sequence where hogarth and mansley attempt to "" outlast "" one another by trying to stay awake is very nicely timed , and also extremely clever . the film even takes some jabs at america's nuclear paranoia during the early stages of the cold war , satirizing the lame safety films shown to grade school students that tell them to "" duck and cover "" in the event of a nuclear attack . "" the iron giant "" has much more of a satirical edge to it than most family films , and the edgy humor is actually quite refreshing . instead of seeing people get bonked on the head , we get well-timed , clever gags that seem to have required some imagination to come up with . when you get right down to it , "" the iron giant "" is no more than the story of a boy and his robot . the story is so straightforward , so quaint , that it ultimately becomes charming . though i enjoy the complex plotting of film noir as much as the next person , when it comes to family entertainment , simple is the way to go . it's akin to one of those bedtime stories your father told that had you hanging on his every word , but it's not the story that sets the film above others of its kind , but rather the elements that go into the story , namely real characters and thoughtful dialogue , which "" the iron giant "" has in spades ."
"it's rather strange too have two computer animated talking ant movies come out in a single year , but that is what disney and pixar animation ; s latest film represents . while a bugs life isn't nearly as deep as it's predecessor , dreamwork's antz , it is just as funny . a bug's life centers , appropriately , around the life of an ant , named flik . flik , cutely voiced by newsradio's david foley , hates sticking too tradition and attempts too find new ways of harvesting food and other task . when one of his inventions causes the offering too be completely lost , the leaders of the colony send him out on a mission too get him out of the way . the offering is food that a vile group of grasshoppers force the ants too harvest for them . the leader of the grasshoppers is hopper , who is fiendishly voiced by oscar winner kevin spacey . when the offering is lost hopper is very upset and he vows to return shortly too retrieve double the amount of food . when the leaders of the ant colony send flik out on his mission , they never dream he will be successful , they just hope they can get him out of the way so they can harvest the extra food . flik's mission is too hire some warrior bugs too fight off the grasshoppers when they return . instead flik accidentally hires circus performing bugs , who he mistakenly assumes are warriors . when he returns with the `warriors' , the town is ecstatic until they find out the truth about their heroes . a bug's life has animation that is simply stunning . the sheer uniqueness of the day to day bug life is very imaginative . together with the great voice acting , this film is the perfect holiday family film . its main weakness is that it couldn't beat antz to the theaters , making it seem like stale material ."
"near the end of 1996 , analysts remarked that the year would be the last in which disney would stand alone as the animation king . the following year , 1997 , saw the first sleeper entry into the genre from a studio other than the magic kingdom : twentieth century fox gave baronial russia to the masses in the form of anastasia . at best , that's all it was -- a sleeper hit , designed to surprise but not shake the industry . in 1998 , however , things have been decidedly different . there have been a number of pushes on disney's death grip on the market , and fifty-one weeks into '98 , a new champion has emerged . dreamworks' the prince of egypt succeeds where all of the other conventionally animated products have failed . the other two contenders , warner brothers' quest for camelot and disney's own annual entry , mulan , lacked inspiration and drive respectively . although camelot was borderline-abysmal , and can't really be considered a shot at the title , mulan had the makings of winner . unfortunately , it was saturated with traditional , disney-cute animation , and lost points against the rapidly-changing face of the competition . in making the prince of egypt , dreamworks has strayed from all of these hallmarks and created a genuinely unique product . the animation is flawless , and , aside from a bug's life , is the best-looking movie to date . the animators have nimbly mixed both flat and spatial effects , and the 2d/3d combination is something that artists from disney and fox have heretofore struggled with . the key to success , however , was that the visuals were used not just because they looked cool but also as a method of advancing the plot . namely , some of the most important action sequences ( like the parting of the red sea ) were done almost entirely in 3d . dreamworks is the first studio to prove that they've got the stuff of success , and that they're capable of challenging disney . the story is also well-written , and the characters voiced with talent . for the most part , the plot follows its source material -- the book of exodus -- although only in the most general sense . the writers took a few creative liberties , and most do not damage the story in any way . in fact , the shakespearean relationship between moses ( val kilmer ) and the pharaoh rameses ( ralph fiennes ) makes the story more interesting if anything . moses , a hebrew , is saved from the slaughter of the firstborn sons by his mother when she sets him in a basket on the nile ; he floats into the pharaoh seti ( patrick stewart ) 's palace and is taken in by the royal family . moses grows up but learns of his heritage and flees into the desert , where he discovers the burning bush and is commissioned by god to return to egypt and free the slaves . by this time , rameses is now pharaoh , and the two brothers , now on opposite sides of the line , face off in a battle of wills and divine intervention . the cast of voices is most impressive , and also includes such noteables as sandra bullock , jeff goldblum , danny glover , and steve martin . the script does not have a lot of one-liners in it , and god is reduced to a voice that might well be mistaken for the same one that spoke to kevin costner in field of dreams , but overall the story is exciting and interesting . it's decidedly for an older crowd , and the tykes who haven't had a few years of religion class will be hopelessly lost . but for those who make the bid , the prince of egypt can be a great watch ."
"note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers . be forewarned . it's startling to consider that it was only a few years ago that film distributors would worriedly rearrange their summer release schedules in order to give the annual disney animated feature juggernaut a wide berth . the lion king had just cracked $300 million domestic in gross to become one of the most profitable ventures in film history , continuing to build on a sturdy base left by prior flicks aladdin and beauty and the beast . since then , though , disney's animated features have shown an unbroken string of diminishing returns , with pocahontas , the hunchback of notre dame , and this year's hercules successively proving less and less potent . with the once seemingly-impregnable disney stranglehold on the market share suddenly looking mighty vulnerable , and faced with their first serious competition in the animated film market from fox's anastasia , disney has brought xmas home early by dusting off the feature which sparked the modern revival of feature animation , the little mermaid . while the animation for the film is , as is typically the case for disney films , unquestionably top-notch , the magic in the little mermaid is not its animation , but the wonderful innocence of its story and its rousingly superb music . the film's storyline is fairly straightforward -- young teen falls for handsome man , father disapproves and assigns hapless chaperone to his daughter , teen disobeys father and goes to desperate lengths to win her man -- except in this case , the chaperone is a crab , the teen is a young mermaid , and the object of her desire is a human prince . what makes the little mermaid so affecting and so emotionally resonant is the richness and charm of its characters and the sheer clarity and honest simplicity of their emotions . from the moment mermaid ariel lays her eyes on prince eric , she's resolutely smitten , and she's such a pure and endearing character that one can't help but invest their heart with her . this simple but touching love story , coupled with a healthy dose of smart humour , makes the little mermaid a remarkably captivating picture . one of the interesting things about the little mermaid is something which now curiously dates it : the voices cast for its motley crew of characters . this film was produced just before the distracting concept of using celebrity voices became in vogue , which started to a certain degree with beauty and the beast and was irrevocably exacerbated by robin williams' much-heralded turn in aladdin ; by the release of the lion king and henceforth , the majority of characters in the animated films were voiced by celebrities . while it's understandable that animated features lacking the name-recognition or drawing power of disney ( say , balto's use of kevin bacon and bridget fonda , or even anastasia's showcasing of meg ryan and john cusack ) would be forced to turn to this strategy in order to hype their products , it's unfortunate that even disney has embraced this policy . do we really need to hear , say , demi moore as esmerelda in the hunchback of notre dame ? is the film's entertainment value really augmented by hearing a recognizable voice , rather than a voice which best suits the role ? ( i'm not exactly on the edge of my seat for eddie murphy in the upcoming mulan . ) fortunately , the performers who voice the characters in the little mermaid , although perhaps more obscure , are impeccably cast . chief among them is jodi benson , a 1992 tony nominee for her stage work in crazy for you , who voices the film's heroine ariel to perfection ; with a wonderfully expressive speaking voice full of youthful vigor , and gorgeous singing voice , ms . benson provides a most engaging anchor for the film . ( she's the only reason i'd even consider catching flubber . ) similarly , samuel e . wright is terrific in the showy role of sebastian , the weary guardian crab . he easily milks his lovable character's comic moments for all they're worth , and his rendering of two of the little mermaid's big tunes -- "" under the sea "" and "" kiss the girl "" -- have become the stuff of legend . pat carrol is deliciously villainous and vampy as the evil sea-witch ursula , while kenneth mars' booming voice conveys the stern yet affectionate authority of ariel's father , king triton . in large roles and small ( edie mcclurg as dotting busybody carlotta is ideal , and rene auberjonois has great fun with his exuberant french chef ) , the little mermaid is impeccably cast . of course , the little mermaid will probably be best remembered for its remarkable collection of songs composed by the songwriting team of alan menken ( music ) and howard ashman ( lyrics ) , who had created little shop of horrors and would go on to compose beauty and the beast and aladdin for disney before mr . ashman's untimely death . not only are mr . menken's tunes unbearably catchy , but mr . ashman's charming lyrics are fully integrated into the film's storyline so that the songs are a virtual extension of the character's dialogue , and consequently work wonderfully within the context of the film . mr . menken's score for the film is equally top-notch ; the sequence where eric ( voiced by christopher daniel barnes ) and ariel tour his kingdom in a horse-drawn carriage becomes magical and wondrous with mr . menken's fine score . it appears that most people prefer the delightfully colourful production number for the calypso-styled "" under the sea "" as joyfully crooned by mr . wright , which won the academy award and golden globe awards for best song -- indeed , one of the many little joys in screening the film during its re-release was listening to children scattered throughout the audience singing along with the tune -- but my favourite is ms . benson's heartfelt rendition of the ballad "" part of your world "" , an achingly beautiful tune of yearning and hope ( wonderfully lyricized by mr . ashman ) which , accompanied by the film's most dazzlingly polished animation sequence , packs an emotional wallop which literally brought tears to my eyes . during the song's reprise , which builds to a crescendo with ariel arching on a rock as a wave crashes in , the cumulative effect is nothing short of breathtaking , and one becomes acutely aware that this single instance is one of the finest in animation history . as of this writing , november 1997 has come to an end , as has disney's limited 17-day re-release of the little mermaid . there's no question that the primary motivation for , if not the film's reissue itself , at least its timing , was to reinforce disney's dominance in the animation market and provide direct competition to fox's costly new upstart animation division and their first major venture , anastasia . in every respect , the re-release of the little mermaid appears to be a success -- the film's 1997 grosses have pushed its cumulative domestic gross over the magic $100 million mark ; the little mermaid proved to have remarkably strong drawing power for a film initially released only eight years ago and in many homes on video , pulling in close to $10 million in its opening weekend ; and although nobody could possibly expect the little mermaid to possibly defeat the aggressively-marketed anastasia in head-to-head competition , it siphoned enough from the fox film's opening weekend totals to keep anastasia from the coveted weekend leader spot , allowing for disney's odious flubber to sweep in on the subsequent week and wrestle the family demographic market share away . but although disney's motives in the reissue of the little mermaid were self-serving and protectionist , the real winner is the public . any reason to put this film back into theatres is a good one , and it's a true joy to see this heartwarming gem back on the silver screen . the little mermaid is the best film to come out of the disney's modern animation renaissance , and one of the greatest animated films ever made ."
"damn those trailers . had it not been for the advertising of this film , which reveals far too much about its contents , i would have been glued to `under the sand' . as it is , the film retains some value , thanks to an excellent performance by charlotte rampling , and a more mature francois ozon in the director's chair . marie ( charlotte rampling ) and her husband jean ( bruno cremer ) lounge on the beach . she takes a nap while he goes for a swim . when marie wakes up , jean is nowhere to be found . she contacts authorities , but they can't find him either . did he disappear to start a new life ? was he killed by accident ? did he commit suicide ? marie still asks herself these questions a year later , and in order to move on with her life , she must find some answers . it's a fine premise , and this little movie uses it to the limit . the film moves at a leisurely pace , a bit slow , but relaxing . it's a very visual story , and you can pretty much just sit back without reading the subtitles . this is mostly thanks to the excellent camera work by antoine heberle and jeanne lapoirie , who shot the film in a dreamy haze , and the lead performance by rampling . rampling is so expressive in her portrayal of marie , you connect with her character instantly , despite that she's delusional . the scenes where she interacts with her husband , who she still believes is alive , are heartbreaking . she can't quite get over him . they've been married for twenty-five years . the other actors , particularly jacques nolot , are excellent too . the sex in the film is rather unneeded , but compared to ozon's `criminal lovers' , it's the disney channel . likely to cause some discussion afterwards , `under the sand' is a fine movie going experience . while it's hard to recommend as entertainment , it's a fine adult alternative about how we deal with loss . ozon seems to ask what you would do , and that's certainly a hard question to answer ."
"you've got to love disney . no matter what they serve up , it is a guaranteed success as long as it's animated . kids have to go see the movie . then they have to get the toys . oh , the video came out ? got to buy it , or risk little billy's temper tantrums for the next month . all of this culminates in the childhood equivalent of a pilgrimage to mecca : a visit to the magic kingdom . stay at the disneyland hotel ! buy a disney t-shirt ! eat an ice cream mickey mouse on a stick ! it's both a vertical and horizontal monopoly when you think about it . dale carnegie should have had it so good . what's most amazing is that all this success is in spite of a severe lack of originality . you see , disney animated features these days have two components : theme and plot . the theme changes with each new movie ; the plot does not . the plot is a mold into which the characters of some ancient fable are dropped , and try as they might to rise above the characters of previous features , they are nearly always destined to do no more than the same . however , while the success of a disney animated feature is generally a given as far as box-office receipts , merchandising dollars , and glimmers in the eyes of little children , critically they are as varied as anything else that hollywood has to offer . luckily , disney's latest animated offering , mulan , manages to be engaging and refreshing , even while rife with formula . the film starts with the invasion of ancient china by the huns , led by the imposing shan-yu ( miguel ferrer ) . soon , china's emperor ( pat morita ) mobilizes his armies and decrees that one male from each family in the country shall serve to fight in china's defense . when the fa family is served notice , it is the elderly father , fa zhou ( soon-tek oh ) who must answer the call , as there are no other males in the household . fearing her father will surely be killed in battle , fa mulan ( ming-na wen ) disguises herself as a man and sneaks off with the royal orders to join the chinese army . mulan , based on a chinese epic poem , is a classic tale of the triumph of the ugly duckling . mulan herself is a disgrace to her loving family , as she has a difficult time fitting into the traditional woman's role , and in a very amusing scene where a matchmaker attempts to assess her value to a potential husband , we see that "" grace "" is not one of her strong points . very early on , we are presented with the high importance of bringing honor to one's family , and by botching her chance at gaining the favor of the matchmaker , mulan fails at that task . by leaving home to fight in her father's place , she may not only spare his life , but bring honor , too . as is the case with most disney musicals , the songs are first rate and pervasive throughout the film . i'm not sure if they will get much airplay , but at least one of the songs will no doubt receive recognition come oscar time . both lea salonga , who provides the singing voice for mulan , and donny osmond who sings for shang , the captain of mulan's army unit and obligatory love interest , are more than competent , although salonga's voice translates much better to animation . you have to hear it to understand . interestingly , the musical numbers which are so often done with big flourishes are surprisingly muted in mulan . there is no significantly big number , which is customary as the second or third song in a disney film , but this does not detract significantly from the rest of the movie . it is , however , an expectation which has been built by disney's own formulaic history , and some viewers may feel as if something is missing . artistically , the animators have chosen to adopt the more subdued pastels of chinese artwork , and although this may not live up to the vibrance so associated with many of the other disney works , it helps to contribute a more authentic , and therefore more credible , nature to what otherwise may be seen as a typically "" disneyfied "" ethnic tale . there are also a couple of visually standout scenes , one involving the charge of shan-yu's hun army , which utilizes the same computer-enhanced imagery disney animators have employed since the chandelier in beauty and the beast . the other scene worth mentioning is so quick you might miss it . when mulan resolves to take her father's place , she dons her father's old battle armor , and unsheathes a sword . as she does so , you can see her reflection in the polished metal . it just left me thinking , "" that was really cool . "" a wonderful range of performances delight the audience throughout the film , varying from the straight , such as soon-tek oh as fa zhou , to the comical , such as harvey fierstein as yao , a gruff , pugilistic member of shang's conscripted army . even more outrageous is eddie murphy as mushu , the diminutive guardian dragon sent to look after mulan . although an obvious attempt to relive the chemistry brought forth by robin williams in aladdin , murphy nevertheless distinguishes himself with his own winning performance . i found the choice of b . d . wong as shang a little strange ( you may remember him as martin short's wedding planner assistant in the father of the bride ) , but they used robbie benson for the voice of the beast in beauty and the beast , so i guess anything's possible . in any event , wong performs admirably as well . one character which provides a significant amount of humor is grandmother fa . she deserves recognition not only because of the levity she brings to the movie , but also because she is voiced by two very remarkable people . june foray , who supplies grandmother fa's speaking voice , is a venerable voice actress who may be best known for her work as rocky the squirrel and natasha fatale ( as in boris and natasha ) . marni nixon , who provides grandmother fa's singing voice , is the same vocalist who dubbed the voices for anna in the king and i , maria in west side story , and eliza in my fair lady . with this in mind , hearing grandmother fa is like listening to a little piece of history . mulan is the latest disney animated feature to get away from some of the eurocentrism which for so long dominated disney films . in an effort to be culturally sensitive ( and to avoid a "" miss saigon "" -type debacle ) , disney has also wisely chosen to employ many asian-american actors for both lead and supporting roles . in addition to the actors already mentioned , the cast includes such ubiquitous talents as james hong , gedde watanabe , james shigeta , and george takei . i guess clyde kusatsu wasn't available . at a running time of slightly under an hour and a half , mulan moves quickly and provides solid entertainment for both children and , happily , adults . this is the kind of disney feature that makes you wonder what they will do next , rather than hope that the next one is better ."
""" a bug's life "" may not be "" toy story , "" but it's more close than "" antz "" was . i really liked "" antz , "" basically because , yes , it is clever and witty and intelligent ( and it has the temerity to take a chance and put woody allen in the lead , perhaps the year's most inspired casting ) , but there was , in fact , something missing from it , and i'm the first to admit that . maybe it's that it never totally lets go and takes off into real innocent fun - it's too obsessed with its orwellian message to become totally engaging , and if it weren't for woody allen , it would have been just a really clever good-not-great flick . "" a bug's life "" has a similar premise , and it also has disney to insure that it's g-rated and not totally over kids' heads like "" antz "" was ( not a bad thing , believe me ) , but what it also has is a tone that's completely innocent even when it's also remaining perpetually clever . "" antz "" is still the more witty film , and i love it for it , and "" a bug's life "" is more for general consumption , but it's also more entertaining . it broadens its horizons , and when it really moves from the ant colony , it really shows us a whole new world we've never seen before , and it's take on the evolution of bugs is a lot better than the one in "" antz . "" it's also light and clever . the visuals are , instead of earth tones , bright worldly colors , and still gives the amazing visual technology of "" antz "" at least a worthy contender . the characters are also nicely realized - though watered-down for broad consumption , they still carry more wit than the contemporary disney animated films . the lead character , flik ( voiced by dave foley ) , is nothing more than a slightly-less neurotic z from "" antz , "" but foley makes him nearly as engaging as allen made z . instead of gene hackman playing the villain , we get the much more menacing kevin spacey as the lead grasshopper , the nicely-titled hopper . and for the romantic lead , we don't get spacey sharon stone , but intelligent and hard-to-get julia-louis dreyfuss , who doesn't even come around until the very final frames . not that the plot's really any better than the one in "" antz "" - it's basically yet another redux of "" the seven samurai , "" with an ant colony under the control of giant grasshoppers forcing them to produce a product for them or else . when flik , a bone fide inventor , creates a time-conserving apparatus that accidentally destroys the season's donation , he puts them all in risk , and is sent away so that he won't screw anything up with the pretense that he is searching for help to fight the grasshoppers . he runs into a group of "" warrirors "" who are , unbeknownst to him , a group of carnival bugs , and they agree to help under similar false pretenses . these bugs are an equally wonderful assortment to anything in "" toy story "" : foppish walking stick slim ( david hyde-pierce ) , german caterpillar heimlich ( joe ranft ) , quick-tempered and insecure male ladybug francis ( denis leary ) , pretentious praying mantis manny ( jonathan harris ) , his assistant butterfly hypsy ( madeliene kahn ) , spider rosie ( bonnie hunt ) , and two fleas , tuck and roll ( michael mcshane ) , who speak in undiscernable jibberish . the writers lightly touch on each bug's place in bug society and the malleability thereof while making a wisecracks at everything they can , and blowing the audience away with wild visual treats . grasshoppers jumping in unison seems like a menacing earthquake . a small bird becomes an ominous mortal threat , whose usual mild-mannered squeal is a scream of death . the bug city is a modern-day metropolis , complete with fireflies temping as traffic lights and a fly sitting on the curb , holding out a cup , with a sign lying next to him that says "" kid tore off wings . "" and a rainstorm is like a giant flood , with each drop acting like a small bomb dropped at millions of miles per hour . around this , the pixar animators stage several large set pieces , like a resuce mission halfway through that is as wild and entertaining as anything this year , and a wonderfully exciting action piece at the end , a chase scene at night through the labyrinthine branches of a small thicket . meanwhile , each character gets the spotlight to be completely idisyncratic and interesting , something "" antz "" couldn't do , and by the end , over the end credits , "" a bug's life "" pulls it's final punch , out clever-ing "" antz "" with a series of incessantly hilarious faux-bloopers that come just at the right time , when those who leave immeadiately after the final frame of a film have left , and you can brag that you were one of the elite who stayed and got the full money's worth of entertainment . still , it's no "" toy story . "" that film , maybe above any animated film i've ever seen , encompassed almost true perfection in story , character , and wit . it proved that it didn't need to brag about it's cutting edge technology to really soar ( it's the least visually striking of the three computer animated films thus far , but is still the most satisfying ) , and created a perfect world of idiosyncratic delights and innocent fun . yet "" a bug's life , "" as well as "" antz , "" are still amazing films , and prove without doubt , that if you're gonna make a computer animated film , send it to the guys who created these three flicks , evne if they're not working under the same roof ."
"most people fit into two different categories : you either love woody allen , or you hate his guts . my family , for the most part , hates him and his movies . i think he's very funny , but his shtick has gotten forced and contrived over the years . so maybe taking his body away was the best decision any producer could have thought of . unrestrained by physical boundaries , allen's humor comes shining through . those who had problems with his physical appearance will be able to join the rest of us in laughing at allen's intelligent observations of life . those who had problems with his verbal comedy may want to skip this one . in 1995 , a film was introduced to audiences which sparked their imaginations and showed them something they'd never seen before . toy story used state-of-the-art computer technology and presented a world of toys who would come alive when no humans were present . many critics will call that a better film , but i believe they only say that because it was a completely original motion picture . antz , however , has upped the ante considerably . disney's a bug's life isn't due out for another two months , and dreamworks seems to have received the better end of the deal . by beating disney out , they have satisfied the audience's thirst for computer-animated films . but don't let that fool you : disney is definitely not scared . in the past two years , competitions have broken out between studios . in 1997 , it was the volcano duel . in my opinion , dante's peak came out way ahead of its predecessor , both in time and in quality . volcano had an original premise , but destroyed that with some very ridiculous situations . in 1998 , there are twice as many competing films . first was the comet competition , and armageddon blew away it's cheesily dramatic competitor deep impact . but now , it's even more interesting , as one beloved studio ( disney ) goes up against the newcomer ( dreamworks ) . who will prevail ? time will tell , but i'm sure that mr . mouse has nothing to fear . this may sound like i didn't like antz ; on the contrary , i'd put it up there with toy story . but due to it's pg rating , many parents may be put off by some of the dialogue which shouldn't appear in disney's version . some of the dialogue in antz pushes the envelope for a family-oriented film . sexual innuendoes and profanity pop up occasionally , which makes dreamworks' animated feature geared more for an adult crowd . the humor is also written especially for adults , though many kids were laughing in the theater i attended . this is the type of film that should be made for families more often : entertaining for kids and entertaining for parents . antz begins with a hilarious monologue which seems a meld between woody allen's shtick and franz kafka's metamorphosis , the short story of a man who wakes up to discover himself as a bug . z ( allen ) is a troubled ant , believing he was not made to be a worker . "" when you're the middle child in a family of five million . . . "" he comments about his neglected childhood . one night , z is sitting in a bar with his friend weaver ( sylvester stallone ) , discussing his pathetic place in life . in walks princess bala ( sharon stone ) , whom no one recognizes without a crown . bala asks z is he would like to dance , and they engage in a pulp fiction-esque dance while everyone else is following the leader . after discovering that she is the princess , z falls in love , but there's a problem : bala is getting married to general mandible ( gene hackman ) , a ruthless leader who merely wants to control a better and stronger colony . in order to do that , he must eliminate not only the queen ( anne bancroft ) , but the weakest of the colony , namely the worker ants . but to get rid of the queen , he needs to get rid of the loyal army ants who would be willing to die for her . he and colonel cutter ( christopher walkin ) come up with a plan to send the loyal ants off to battle , where they will surely be killed . the queen is reluctant at first , but decides it is best for the colony . meanwhile , z wants to meet bala again , and he asks weaver , an army ant , to switch places with him . so z gets sent off to battle , but he manages to survive the slaughter by the termites . the battle sequence is absolutely stunning , though you may have flashbacks to starship troopers , which contained a very similar sequence . however , antz and that 1997 film were both in production around the same time , so the similarities are merely coincidence . the second half of the film revolves around z's kidnapping of bala , and their search for a mythical place called insectopia . there , an ant can be his own boss and have all the food he wants . the adventures z and bala get into are surprisingly high in tension , especially one involving a magnifying glass . looming over the targets like the spaceships from independence day ( in fact , i'm just going to assume that the producers referenced id4 intentionally ) . the ants look up in awe , and then a beam of fire blasts into the ground . visually , it's an exciting rush of adrenaline . but don't be fooled . . . little kids shouldn't see this , as they may just try and copy it . after seeing antz , i vowed never to intentionally step on an ant again . hopefully , children will learn that killing ants is rather cruel . as an animated film , antz is probably the best you will find to date . visually , it's as stunning as what dreams may come . the best aspect of animation is the fact that the characters aren't limited by gravity . they can take ridiculous situations and make them seem plausible . one great moment involves a mass of worker ants bunching up to form a wrecking ball . the animation is so perfect that you can virtually see every single ant on the ball . however , the most exhilarating scene involves bala getting stuck to the bottom of a young boy's shoe . it's truly a great example of film making at its finest . with computer technology , the animators have carefully made the ants' faces look similar to the actors providing the voices . the best example would have to be barbatus ( danny glover ) . at one point , you can even see the pores on his face ( although , i doubt ants have pores . . . do they ? ) . barbatus also has a touching but rather gruesome scene as he has his final words with z without a body . young kids may be disturbed by the site of a dismembered head , but a good deal of humor is derived ( more appropriate for adults , of course ) . disney's a bug's life looks good , but i don't know if they will be able to best dreamworks' newest animated feature in terms of animation . if not , then dreamworks will have done something no other studio could do : go head to head with the big mouse , and knock him down ( yes , anastasia was good , but not nearly as good as even the worst of disney ) . vocal talent is always essential to an animated feature , and antz has one of the best line-ups seen since toy story . in fact , it far exceeds that one . woody allen has always been funny , but here he transcends most of what he's done in the past few years . without a body , his comic timing is the most noticeable thing . in fact , i'm pretty sure that the writers let him improvise a lot of his lines . sharon stone as bala shows off some of her comic ability , though for the most part , stone works best as a dramatic actress . sylvester stallone ( teamed up with stone once again ) is beginning to solidify his statement that he wants to be an actor , not a typecast action star . after a snub at the oscars last year , stallone is proving himself as the serious ( or comedic , as illustrated here ) actor that he is . gene hackman is superb as the gruff-talking general , almost doing another take on his crimson tide persona . christopher walkin is probably more noticed by his voice , and so many people will remember him from such hits as batman returns . anne bancroft has a minimal role , but she's effective nonetheless . danny glover has a small role , but he does a very , very good job . dan aykroyd and jane curtin also lend their voices as two lovesick , euro-trash bees--both are very unrecognizable , especially aykroyd . jennifer lopez plays a worker ant who falls in love with weaver , although most people won't recognize her voice either . many people will recognize grant shaud's voice as the foreman . he played miles on the tv show murphy brown . this is definitely a huge cast with some high-profile names , and it will definitely help it's grosses . of course , you can probably tell where a lot of the $60 million budget went to , also . directors eric darnell and lawrence guterman are relative newcomers ( though guterman did direct a 1994 feature , headless ! ) . but both show an incredible talent for this type of a picture . tense at times , and very funny throughout , the two hold this film together like professionals . the screenplay by todd alcott and chris weitz is quite simple in plot , but it contains a lot of subtlety that makes the film more suitable for adults . kids will delight in the animation , while parents can laugh heartily at the humor . most of it will go over young children's heads . does that mean you shouldn't take kids to see it ? not at all . they will have a lot of fun watching this one . what is great is the themes that are given to us . part social commentary , part romance story , and part moral drama , antz gives everyone something to talk about , whether it be the animation , or the discussions of individualism and community . thankfully , it's not subtle in either aspects . antz is rated pg for mild language and some intense action . sometimes the language can be pushing the limits for a family movie , but the violence is what should keep kids at home . the battle scene has ants melting in acid , and bugs being speared to death . and the magnifying scene shows an ant disintegrate in the beam of sunlight . but other than that ( and some sexual innuendos ) , it's a perfect choice for some wholesome fun at the theaters . i doubt many children will understand the sexual innuendos unless they are old enough , but it's still advisable to leave really young children at home . have i confused you enough ? if you do take your kids , i recommend seeing the film with them , because more than likely , you'll enjoy it the most ."
""" you'll go ape over tarzan because it's more fun than a barrel of monkeys ! "" okay , there's the quote in case disney wants to put something in their ads for the movie . disney's latest animated feature throws us right into the action from the very beginning , skipping the usual main title sequence and putting us on pitching waves as a small family attempts to escape from a sinking ship . father , mother , and infant somehow make it to shore amidst a rousing song by phil collins , and have soon built a treehouse which would impress the swiss family robinson . it's amazing , the kinds of things you can do when you work to a soundtrack . before you know it , an unfortunate set of circumstances put the baby in the hands of kala ( glenn close ) , a mother ape who recently lost her own baby to a predatory leopard . against the wishes of her mate and family leader , kerchak ( lance henricksen ) , she takes on the infant boy as her own . tarzan is not so much a story about a human boy surviving in the african jungles as it is about one who does not really fit in either humanity or the wild . much of tarzan's young life is spent trying to become one of the apes in the eyes of his peers and his "" father , "" which occasionally gets him into trouble no matter how well-meant his attempts . all he's looking for is acceptance , perhaps a goal easily identifiable by young viewers , but one which will ring true with a lot of adults . when you really think about it , this story fits right into the disney formula of the outcast that triumphs in the end . look back on past disney animated features and you'll see the trend . growing up , tarzan ( voiced by alex d . linz as a child , and by tony goldwyn as an adult ) has a couple of friends . one is an ape named terk ( rosie o'donnell ) , and the other is a paranoid hypochondriac of an elephant named tantor ( wayne knight ) . both provide the requisite comic relief ( timon and poombah from the lion king immediately come to mind ) and perform the usual hijinks as prescribed by the disney mold . i'm beginning to think anyone can write the screenplay for one of these films . just fill in the blanks ! can you see it ? "" now we have to have a couple of zany friends for out hero who might get him into mischief , but cover for him or come to his rescue when he needs it . we've already had a fish and a crab , and we've had a candle and a teapot , a genie and a dog , a few stone statues . . . . have we had an ape and an elephant yet ? well , there we go ! "" of course , there's gotta be romance somewhere along the line , so jane ( minnie driver ) gets introduced about halfway through . together with her father dr . porter ( nigel hawthorne ) and the big game hunter clayton ( brian blessed ) , jane is on an expedition to find and study the wild gorillas of africa . she discovers the man raised by apes and is enchanted almost immediately , and soon shares an amusing version of the compulsory "" you tarzan , me jane "" scene . thankfully , those aren't the exact words . however , i found it distracting that tarzan is going "" ohh ohh ee ee "" one second and then tells jane his name in this manly voice with perfect diction . how does he tell his name to another ape ? "" ohh ohh ee - tarzan - ee ee ohh ? "" well , regardless of my picky nature , the romance actually works as only disney romance can : purely contrived , but for some reason rather believable . but hey , tarzan's a young adult . do you think he dated a few of the female apes before meeting jane ? isn't that illegal in most countries ? oh , well . i don't think disney will be using my quote anymore . tarzan departs from the usual disney feature in that this one is not a musical . there's lots of music to be sure , but not a single character song in the whole hour and a half of running time . we instead get more of a phil collins concert , as no less than five of his original songs are used as interlude material . this isn't really a bad thing , as the songs are very high-energy and catchy ( i found myself singing one to myself for most of the following day ) ; it's just different . do yourself a favor and see this film in a theater with a good sound system , because the music will come through astonishingly well and really enhance the movie . with each new feature , disney animation gets even better . not necessarily by leaps and bounds , but since they put out a new film each year , a steady rate of improvement is apparent , and this definitely shows in tarzan . there are a couple of scenes where the animation achieves a near 3-d effect , and a number of scenes which feature tarzan moving through the trees are absolutely dizzying . the way he slides down tree limbs and trunks is very reminiscent of skateboarding and rollerblading maneuvers , and had me thinking this isn't just tarzan , it's "" extreme tarzan . "" however , tarzan does not seem to have what i call its "" chandelier scene , "" which is the one scene to which the animators have chosen to devote an inordinate amount of effort , utilizing a computer-assisted process that makes the animation absolutely breathtaking . lasting but a few seconds at most , it's been the signature of nearly every disney animated feature since beauty and the beast , in which the castle ballroom chandelier was rendered in stunning detail . as usual , the voice talent is up to snuff , convincingly make you believe in the convictions of animated characters . the one poor choice in casting , however , was rosie o'donnell . going into the film , i didn't know she was even a part of it , but when terk started talking , i recognized her voice immediately . her performance was fine , but through the rest of the film i kept thinking , "" that's no boy ape , that rosie o'donnell . "" distracting to say the least . i'll admit i've never read the edgar rice burroughs story "" tarzan of the apes , "" so i couldn't tell you how true this film stays to the book . but unless you're a purist , you should have few objections to this film . with solid performances , action , adventure , a bit of romance , and great music and animation , tarzan should appeal to the kids and to the kid in all of us . note : when i wrote my review of mulan a year ago , i went off on the promotional and merchandising tie-ins prevalent with the release of a disney animated feature . this time , i'll just say that i went to mcdonald's yesterday to treat myself to a mcflurry , and tarzan was on the cup . 'nuff said ."
"written by mark rosenthal and lawrence konner starring charlize theron , bill paxton , david paymer as reviewed by james brundage i'm beginning to get fed up . over my four years as a critic , the thing which has kept me going is the moderate balance of films . the good balances the bad . i try to see both in equal proportions . but disney's mighty joe young remake marks the fourth week in which i haven't seen a truly terrible movie . it's a backwards machismo , i suppose , the urge to see the things which you so loathe ; but i need to see a bad film every once in a while . and , you know what , mighty joe young doesn't qualify . far from being bad , mighty joe young is actually a family fun movie . it's enjoyable , appropriate , cute , cuddly , and all of those other things that i've been seeing in every movie since a bug's life . mighty joe young tracks a 2 , 000 pound gorilla in the wilds of africa that is taken to a reserve in . . . california ? . . . for safe-keeping . okay . a little unrealistic , but who ever said a kid's movie had to have the slightest hint of realism . the first half of the movie is a gorillas in the mist-esque hatred of poachers woman-of-the-wild motif . the second half is a straight up parody of king kong , awestruck onlookers and all . mark one down . i'm feeling relaxed . it is , as a point of fact , an extremely un-creative movie . but , as a vetern , i can say quite honestly that creativity doesn't count for as much as it should . so that saves mighty joe from my wrath , although my colleagues and cohorts and surely bashing this film at this very moment . this is not the film to take a girl on a date to . it's not the film for you . it's the film for you and your family . when you're right alongside your kid , all of the normal rights and wrongs slip away . the same thing happens when you watch a horror movie or an action flick . it becomes fun . all you have to do to enjoy mighty joe young is shut up and watch ."
"most sequels don't do what they're supposed to do like "" toy story 2 "" does . far too many of them end up re-hashing the original and adding very little . is it any wonder that most sequels fail to live up to their predecessors ? thankfully , "" toy story 2 "" is a wonderful exception . i can't remember the last time i saw a sequel as consistently fun and inventive as this one . it's yet another sign that pixar , the acclaimed animation studio behind "" toy story "" and "" a bug's life , "" is still at the top of its game . woody and buzz are back in the sequel to the 1995 hit "" toy story , "" and things have changed a bit since the last one ended . woody ( voiced by tom hanks ) is preparing to leave with his owner andy for cowboy camp . in his absence , he has assigned buzz lightyear ( tim allen ) , now comfortable in his role as a toy , to take charge . unfortunately , woody's trip is ruined when he is accidentally put into the family garage sale , and is stolen by an over-zealous toy collector ( wayne knight ) . off to save him are buzz and members of the old "" toy gang , "" including mr . potato head ( don rickles ) , rex the nervous dinosaur ( wallace shawn ) , hamm the piggy bank ( john ratzenberger ) , and slinky dog ( jim varney ) . while in captivity , woody makes a startling discovery : he is actually part of a collection of toys based on a 1950's children's show entitled "" woody's roundup . "" he meets the show's other characters , which include jesse ( joan cusack ) , his cowgirl sidekick , the wise old prospector ( kelsey grammer ) , and bullseye , his trusty horse . they have all been anxiously awaiting woody's arrival , as once their set is completed , they will be sold to a japanese toy museum , and finally escape storage forever . this means woody now faces a difficult choice . with his friends coming to rescue him , does he go with them and spend a few more years with andy , or does he go to japan and be immortalized forever ? as in the original film , "" toy story 2 "" contains first-rate animation , and pixar studios has done a remarkable job improving on the impressive work they did there . reportedly , the film was originally slated for a direct-to-video release , but after seeing the improvements that had been made , disney rightly decided to release it into theaters . the film is well worth seeing on the big screen . the colors are bright , the textures sharp , and even the human characters look more "" human . "" the animation is consistently seamless , with the action fast and furious and the facial expressions believable . there are so many impressive sequences that i'd find it impossible to list them here , but i was particularly wowed by a scene where buzz and his cohorts must get across a busy intersection to get to al' s toy barn , the store owned by woody's captor . pixar's rendition of the family dog is also nicely done , with fur so realistic you almost feel you could reach out and touch it . the voice work is also perfectly complementary , and as with the first movie , does much to help further character development . tom hanks and tim allen again disappear into their roles as woody and buzz , making you forget who is doing the voice . it was woody and buzz up there , not tom and tim . all the cast members from the original reprise their roles , and each is excellent . several new voices have been added , with joan cusack , kelsey grammer , and wayne knight doing fine work . "" toy story 2 "" is strong in characterization , and is able to expand on what we saw in the first movie . woody faces difficult choices , while buzz is confronted with a new buzz who hasn't yet realized his status as a toy , forcing him to see what he used to be like . the new characters are also developed quite well , especially jesse , who narrates a sarah mclachlan-aided flashback illustrating how she was loved , then forgotten by her owner . it may be computer-animated , and it may have sappy music , but it's downright touching . the script , despite having a story and screenplay each credited to four different writers , is endlessly clever and inventive , especially considering that it's a sequel . the reason "" toy story 2 "" works where other movie sequels fail is that it refuses to just capitalize on the original's success by re-doing the same story and using the same characters . not this one . we get character change , new characters , and new issues brought up . "" toy story 2 "" is also remarkable for the way in which it keeps reinventing itself . there is always another clever idea waiting just around the corner here . the humor is sharp and witty , with something to amuse both kids and adults . there are funny asides to films such as "" star wars "" and "" jurassic park , "" among others , new takes on classic toys like barbie and rock 'em sock 'em robots , and appearances from other pixar efforts "" a bug's life "" and the 1997 short "" geri 's game . "" ( geri himself makes an appearance as a toy repairman who fixes woody's broken arm . ) the action is fast and furious , and the chases ( in the street , in a toy store , in an elevator , on a baggage carousel , and in an airplane ) keep getting bigger and better . "" toy story 2 "" never grows stagnant , because there is always something new to hold your interest . the more you pay attention to it , the more rewarding it is . it's rare to see a film like "" toy story 2 "" come along , because it's the kind of film that's almost impossible to dislike . it's created purely to entertain , and though i enjoy a thought-provoking drama as much as the next person , it's nice to see that films are still trying to do exactly what movies first tried to do : send us out with a smile . it's a fair bet that the whole family will have smiles on their collective faces after seeing "" toy story 2 .

"synopsis : shrek ( myers ) is an ogre living in contented solitude deep in the heart of a forest , until his home is invaded by fairy tale creatures fleeing the rule of the evil lord farquaad ( john lithgow ) . farquaad agrees to relocate the pests , on the condition that shrek rescues princess fiona ( diaz ) -- whom farquaad desires to wed -- from a far-off castle . grudgingly , shrek sets out , joined in his quest by an unwanted companion , donkey ( murphy ) . review : one memorable aspect of disney's "" aladdin "" was that it finally gave robin williams a character -- the genie -- to best take advantage of his comic talents . "" shrek "" does the same for eddie murphy ; ironically , though , murphy's ideal vessel turns out to be an ass . all the same , "" shrek "" does represent murphy's best comic outing in years , and as donkey he steals all the best lines . for instance , after getting belted with pixie dust while trying to conceal his nature as a magical creature , donkey soars into the air and scoffs , "" now i'm a flying talking donkey ! "" and despite its many contributors , the script for "" shrek "" is full of such comic gems . myers is delightful in more of a straight man role , and lithgow also gets some great moments ( watch for a hilarious repartee with the gingerbread man ) . "" shrek "" takes great pleasure in lampooning fairy tales and nursery rhymes of all sorts , and reserves a few delightful knocks at disney in the bargain . things do go somewhat astray during the film's middle segment , which concentrates too much on the main characters at the expense of some of the terrific fairy tale satire which is the movie's greatest strength . but even then , one can always sit back and enjoy the beautiful computer animation , whose remarkable use here represents yet another dazzling leap forward for the technology ."
"do film critics have morals ? are there any unwritten laws an ethical movie critic would or should follow ? naturally we don't want to go into a film with any preconceived notions , which is pretty tough but something we all have to accomplish . secondly , and along the same line , we can't prejudge a film because of it's stars , director , etc . the difference ? well , in the first one , we'd go into a film thinking it's going to be dumb or it's going to be good , and that would affect our viewing ( that movie sounds and looks dumb , so i'm not expecting much ) . on the second hand , we're simply assuming it will be bad or good because of a personal "" grudge "" against the film company ( it's made by disney ? oh , it's just a merchandising ploy then ) , the actors ( jim carrey's in it ? it's gonna stink ! ) , or the director ( who ? can't be that good ) . this is more of a biased viewpoint as opposed to a first impression viewpoint . make sense ? ok , but what about comparing ? isn't that kind of along the same lines ? when we compare a certain actor or director or even composer's credibility in one film to another they were involved in , is that really fair ? sure , in sequels you can expect and accept comparisons a lot more , but what about jackie brown , for example ? is it fair for me to take the review and turn it into a comparison of pulp fiction , just because quentin tarantino directed and wrote the screenplay for both ? i think it is , and i'll tell you why . a good critic should be able to view the film from the "" average joe ( or jane ) "" viewpoint , while still taking into account the artistic integrity behind the film . sometimes that can be tough . "" the acting was superb , but i was bored "" or "" i loved it ! ! it was sooooo cheezy ! "" might be used to describe a film . these are contradictions , and a critic has to weigh both sides and come to a suitable balanced critique . but which is more important ? and which is better ? an extremely well shot and acted film that is boring , or a really amateurish film that you wanna go back to again and again ? getting back to the point , my philosophy on comparing films being fair works because we're reflecting what the public wants to know anyway . every average person out there who's interested in this film is likely to ask "" how does it compare to pulp fiction ? "" and so , as a critic , i'm already responsible to ask that same question . jackie brown stars pam grier , the "" blaxploitation "" heroine from the 1970's , who is likely to make a big comeback thanks to her role as the title character . tarantino's pulp fiction is in big part responsible for john travolta's sudden revival in the movie industry , and with talks of an oscar nomination , the same is likely to happen for grier . ( we've made it thru comparison #1 ! ) jackie is a 44-year-old airline stewardess who brings in extra cash , and probably her main revenue , by smuggling large sums of money into the united states for ordell robbie ( pulp fiction's samuel l . jackson and comparison #2 ) . ordell is in the illegal firearms business and has enlisted the aid of louis gara ( robert de niro ) , a bank robber who just got out of prison after serving four years , to help him accomplish a scheme worth a half- million dollars . trouble arises when jackie is stopped by atf agent ray nicolet ( michael keaton ) and taken into custody for possession of narcotics , as well as having more money than is allowed in an airport without being claimed . naturally this proves an obstacle to ordell's plans and , not as friendly intended as we'd hope , he posts jackie's bail after she is put behind bars . the thing is , ordell is in this for no one more than himself , and as we learn from his previous actions , he's willing to kill anyone who stands in the way . jackie finds herself in a tight squeeze . ordell won't think twice about taking her out if she fails to help him as she's always done , yet at the same time , a compromise with the authorities would be in order if evidence against ordell was provided . it comes down to a simple question : would jackie rather face ordell or prison ? what ensues is a rich and intriguing example of storytelling as we question who jackie is really out to help : the law , ordell , or maybe just herself . coming into play is another 70's veteran , robert forster as jackie's bail bondsmen max cherry . max's obvious fondness for jackie will become a major benefactor in her fight to beat both sides of the system , and forster plays him with subtle charm that adds depth to unbrewed romance . also involved is ordell's "" surfer girl "" girlfriend melanie ( bridget fonda ) , a ditzy sun- bleached babe who spends her time watching tv with a bong in hand . fonda does the best she can with an essentially thin role , but there's nothing more to her , and therefore , she becomes a tossable addition to an otherwise flourishing bouquet of characters . de niro is also wasted in his role as a quiet nobody crook out to score a few bucks for himself . de niro is a brilliant actor , but a character who hardly ever speaks doesn't need a de niro to play him . compared to pulp fiction ( comparison #3 ) , the characters in jackie brown and very thin and replaceable . in pulp fiction , even the small , seemingly irrelevant characters were wonderful , complete , and lifelike , whereas jackie brown has such common figures that it wouldn't have suffered much with a lesser talented cast , the exception being grier . tarantino wrote this script with grier specifically in mind , so to say that she is made for this role is a reversed truth . sadly , grier too could have received a bit more attention , especially when the story is all about her newly-jarred perception of life . jackson teams up with tarantino again , but the chemical reaction isn't as awesome as the first time . jules was the rambling , bible-quoting hitman in pulp fiction , and jackson is the only person who could have pulled it off . and although jackson is really , really good in jackie brown , i don't think he's quite as irreplaceable . in fact , maybe a new face would have been better . jackson could've remained tarantino's jules , and a new guy could have become ordell , forever to remain so in our memories . sadly , these characters are too much the same , except ordell just isn't as impressive , and putting this in the hands of jackson once again is only going to deter from our fond recollections of jules . another problem is that ordell is way too focused on in the beginning . this is grier's film , so why spend so long getting to know a man who will become more of a supporting character as the film progresses ? it not only makes the movie feel a little too slanted , but it makes for a slow beginning because we have to take longer getting to the meat of the story . it is likely that those pouring into the theater to see this film are going to be those anxious to partake of tarantino's quirky dialogue and eccentric directing style , and not so much those interested in seeing a silver screen adaption of elmore leonard's novel "" rum punch "" . for those movie-goers , don't expect another pulp fiction and you'll be satisfied , for the script oozes with the familiar brash qualities that has made tarantino an icon of 90's film- making . the directing has toned down a bit , however , yet we're still reminded that this is tarantino's movie thanks to odd split-screen story-telling devices and scenes being replayed multiple times from different viewpoints . so getting back to the question that i began with , this isn't pulp fiction at all . it's good , but it isn't anything that made pulp fiction such a revolutionary effort in the first place . this is a more conservative tarantino , but not one that won't satiate true fans . if you can realize that this isn't going to knock your socks off , then you'll be happy to at least let it massage your feet . after all , we all know how much tarantino loves that particular part of the human anatomy ."
"to paraphrase a song title from an earlier disney movie , mulan is a whole new world . the mouse factory's latest feature is a treasure , featuring magnificent animation , a strong story and finely drawn characters . mulan is the story of a fiesty , head-strong young woman who , unlike other disney heroines , isn't seeking her prince charming , mulan's motivations are simple ; to save her father , serve her country and find a place for herself in a world in which females have no say . the story of mulan takes place in ancient china at a time when the huns have invaded the nation . the emperor has called for a conscription , one man from each family to join the army and defend the nation . mulan's crippled father is called , but mulan sneaks off , steals his armor and takes his place . mulan is a saga of courage and self-discovery . yet , despite the grim backdrop of war , it is a lively tale of self-reliance and brain-over-brawn that even the smallest child can appreciate and enjoy . the movie utilizes a strong corps of asian-american talent as the voices for the main characters , including the wonderful ming-na wen ( the joy luck club ) as mulan , b . d . wong as shang , mulan's commanding officer and later love interest , pat morita as the emperor and the veteran soon-tek oh as mulan's proud , but loving father . also adding to the proceedings is eddie murphy as mushu the dragon , sent by mulan's ancestors to watch over and help the young woman . his fast , wise-cracking , hip-talking mushu may seem out of place , but it's a crowd pleasing performance , especially for the youngsters . the movie features only a couple of songs , fewer than most previous disney animated flicks , but mulan's are winners . the music by matthew wilder and lyrics by david zippel fit nicely into the plot . the overall score by jerry goldsmith also is a plus . mulan is a treat , more powerful than hercules , with more heart than the hunchback of notre dame . at about 85 minutes , mulan moves rapidly , and will hold the attention of youngsters from beginning to the end . mulan will set a new standard by which future animated efforts by disney and other studios will have to work hard to attain . also , it is hoped that the success of mulan , and there is no doubt that it will prove to be a popular vehicle , will spur an interest for more movies with oriential or asian-american themes so as to provide more substantial roles for the talented performers who gave their voices for this production . it would be nice to see them on screen as well as hear them . committed to lifelong learning through effective communication"

"" starring sarah patterson , angela lansbury , tusse silberg , david warner directed by neil jordan written by jordan and angela carter , from a story by carter cinematography by bryan loftus in recent years , there has been a trend in the field of fantasy : writers have been revisiting the fertile world of myth and fairy tale and reclaiming that world , investing it with new life and energy . in modern times , fairy tales have become disneyfied and debased ; they have become trite adventures involving leering witches , friendly dwarves , and cuddly talking animals . but in their original forms , fairy tales have a dark , wicked edge . crows tear out the eyes of cinderella's sisters , a gorier fate then they receive in the animated version . hansel and gretel relish cooking the witch in her own oven . writers have become fascinated by the bloodier , morally ambivalent aspects of fairy tales , and are now modernizing the old stories while simultaneously going back to their roots . before this trend was in vogue , angela carter--whose stories always have a dark , wicked , subversive edge--had been reinventing fairy tales for years . in the company of wolves , she and neil jordan retell the story of red riding hood , enlivening it with werewolves , rolls royces , and a visit from satan . the story is structured as a dream , occurring in the mind of rosaleen ( sarah patterson ) , an adolescent girl about whose 'real' life we learn very little . within the dream , there are a number of inset stories , most told by dream-rosaleen's grandmother ( angela lansbury ) , and these tales gloss the central story in intriguing , suggestive ways . the result is a surprisingly successful example of a sinister , contemporary fairy tale . i say "" surprisingly "" because there are so many ways this film could have gone wrong . and there are ways in which it does . the performances are mediocre , except for lansbury's--she finds the right note for the prim , apple-cheeked granny , the wise and stern teller of cautionary tales . the soundtrack , synth-heavy , reminded me of bad 80s horror movies , as did the special effects in the shapechanging scenes . probably state-of-the-art at the time , they are now laughable . but jordan succeeds at what i consider the trickiest aspect of the film : he transcends the poor acting/music/effects and conveys a sense of the fantastic , of otherness . one of the problems in adapting full-blown fantasies is that fantasy is often best left to the imagination of the reader , rather than being subjected to the 'realism' of the screen . part of me would love to see an adaptation of 'the lord of the rings , ' but , on the other hand , i know that any filmmaker's recreation of ents , hobbits , and balrogs is inevitably going to be really lame compared to what i picture in my mind . this makes jordan's accomplishment here seem mighty impressive to me : he imbues the company of wolves with a genuine sense of magic and mystery . the somewhat ruritanian dreamworld becomes a kind of ur-reality . the sunshine is exceptionally warm and abundant . the nights are quiet and misty and eerie and ghostly . the peasant village is rustic and cozy , the woods old and hoary . this archetypal realm is the setting for a smart , subtle , literate script , a script which is as good as you'd expect from jordan ( himself an accomplished fiction writer ) and carter . for carter , the cauldron of story is a witches' brew , bubbling over with primal ingredients : mist-shrouded forests , ancient graveyards , virginal girls and wise women , wolves with glowing eyes . she adeptly blends them all together . there is a symbolic richness to the film ; everything is permeated with a sense of significance . the point of it all , i think , is to represent a girl's rites-of-passage on an unconscious , primordial level . a night-journey through the forest , from the village to the grandmother's home , is the crux of the company of wolves . "" don't stray from the path , "" rosaleen is told , again and again , and the path is both literal and figurative : the path through the forest and the path of life . staying on the path is the conventional approach suggested by rosaleen's elders . carter and jordan , never conventional , explore what goes on when you leave the path . those who stray will supposedly meet with a dark fate . this fate is literalized in the dream as werewolves , but the werewolves connote many things : death , sex , knowledge . if straying from the path leads to death , then it's not a good idea--but if that's what you have to risk to get sex and knowledge ( and therefore power ) , then maybe it's worth the risk . when you leave the path , the world becomes a dangerous , ambiguous place , but it's full of potential . and it's certainly more interesting than the disney version ."

"i recall the trials and tribulations of my high school years . it was a period that would mercilessly force me to exit boyhood and thrust me into the unwelcome arms of adulthood . but of all the experiences that i collected throughout those tender years , i can honestly say that the toughest and the scariest thing that i had to cope with was my raging hormones and my crazed curiosity about girls and sex . yes , more scarier than my seventh grade english teacher and even scarier than the bullies that constantly hounded me , trying to deal with my personal wonderment about sex was like trying to fight an invisible monster . for all teenagers , it's almost like a rite of passage . and what we did was sometimes downright nasty , sometimes funny , and sometimes shocking . and all of that is terrifically and shamelessly brought to light in what might be the funniest movie this summer . `american pie' is a comedy about four sexually frustrated seniors that enter into a pact to lose their virginity by the end of the school year . just how great are their hormones raging ? one of them notes , after watching disney's the little mermaid , that ariel is soooo hot . the four schoolmates are kevin , oz , finch and jim . kevin is the only one with a steady girlfriend , but doesn't want to have sex until the time is just right . but what is the perfect time ? there is just no way to know , and that frightens him . oz is the big jock who decides that the way to score with the girls is to listen to them and to be more sensitive . he joins up with a jazz choir and discovers that getting in touch with his feminine side has some tremendous advantages . finch is the phobic hermit who doesn't stand a chance with any girl . so , he pays someone $200 to start spreading rumors about his prowess . suddenly , girls are lining up to go out with him . but among these friends , it is jim that is the most curious and the most fearful . when he has a chance to romp with a pretty exchange student , his inexperience comes shining through . he has much to learn , and will do anything to seek out this kind of knowledge . this may include watching scrambled porn channels or experimenting with mom's apple pie in a scene that is completely shocking , raunchy , yet unbelievably funny . the one thing that i want to say about this film is that it well deserves its `r' rating . there is stuff in here that is completely gross in the same manner that `there's something about mary' was gloriously ribald . in fact , at first this film received a sinful nc-17 rating before a couple of more cuts finally brought it down to a teen-accessible rating . but i guess after seeing the no-holds-barred coarseness of south park , this seems tame by comparison . teens and anyone who can still remember their acne years are the ones that will laugh hardest . but unlike many teen sex comedies , there is a genuine intelligence at work here . these are four normal boys who have a natural curiosity about sex . their plans of action are thoughtful and they think about the consequences . they know what they want , yet temper it with responsibility . but almost always , it's impossible to know how to fight the invisible monster , and it's these episodes that make `american pie' such a carnal delight to watch ."
"directed by : pixote hunt , hendel butoy , eric goldberg , james algar , francis glebas , gaetan & paul brizzi conducted by : james levine composed by : ludwig van beethoven , ottorino respighi , george gershwin , dmitri shostakovich , camille saint-saens , paul dukas , sir edward elgar , igor stravinsky rated : g scripture references : 1 samuel 16 : 23 , ephesians 5 : 19 , 1 chronicles 15 : 15-16 in 1940 , walt disney released a filmed experiment . fantasia was a blend of two art forms : classical music and animation . while it was not immediately popular with the audiences of its day , it has since become recognized as something of a classic . according to the program notes , it was mr . disney's intention to have fantasia be a continual work in progress . sixty years later , thanks to the ongoing efforts of walt's nephew , a new fantasia is being released . it was not only worth the waiting , it is evidence to just how far animation has come during the past half-decade . with seven new sequences and one old favorite , fantasia 2000 exhibits an imagination and respect for its art form that is absent from most other feature films . like the original , fantasia 2000 will more than likely bore the very young , although there is more narrative appeal in this newer version and the segments appear to be substantially shorter , perhaps a nod to the shorter attention span of the studio's primary audience . ranging from the silly to the sublime , each segment is preceded by a short , humorous introduction or interstitial by a guest celebrity host , steve martin ( bowfinger ) being the first and most effective . these are quickly forgotten as conductor james levine leads the chicago symphony orchestra through the musical program which , along with the images drawn by the disney team of animators , is thoughtfully and beautifully brought to a stunning synthesis . fantasia 2000 is being released exclusively in the giant-screened imax theaters , making for a unique viewing experience . there is enough variety in the program to provide something enjoyable for everyone and surely , people will exit the theaters with their own personal favorites . for me , that would have to be the jazz age story of four unconnected and discontented people living in nyc who , unknowingly , help each other realize their dreams . drawn in the style of caricaturist al hirschfeld and inspired by george gershwin's rhapsody in blue , the music and images are blended perfectly resulting in a product greater than the sum of its two parts . children will like the short piece set to carnival of the animals by camille saint-saens . here , a goofy looking flamingo irritates the rest of the flock with his yo-yo playing antics . they will also giggle as donald duck , playing noah's assistant , tries to load the animals into the ark to the familiar strains of pomp and circumstance by sir edward elgar . ( while the depiction is not biblically accurate , it is entertaining and might be excuse enough to familiarize ourselves with the true record by reading what is written in genesis 7 . ) a positive note is that the studio has avoided any segment which is as perversely dark as nihgt on bald mountain upon which the original film ended . there are some images based upon fantasy such as the flying whales in respighi's pines of rome or images which have their roots in mythology such as the ethereal creatures which tell the story of nature's cycle of life , death , and rebirth in igor stravinsky's firebird suite . but the stories they tell are uplifting , containing nothing too frightening for our younger children . the darkest segment , spiritually speaking , actually belongs to the only holdover from the original fantasia , mickey mouse in the sorcerer's apprentice by paul dukas . but overall , the emotions evoked from fantasia 2000 are positive ones , being full of hope and promise . music has an impact which can be undeniably felt , capable of leading the listener to emotional peaks and inspirational highs simply not attainable through other mediums . it is no wonder that the levites , as the priestly tribe of the old testament , were also the appointed musicians . if fantasia 2000 is able to introduce a new audience to music which inspires and exalts , it will have done an incredible service ."
"disney cements their place in the forefront of feature animation with the release of their latest animated adventure , mulan . while it adheres a bit too close to the disney formula to be perfect , it is nonetheless an entertaining film for both kids and adults . fa mulan ( ming-na wen , singing : lea salonga ) wants nothing more than to be a dutiful daughter and honor her family . . . it's just that she doesn't quite fit in with the chafing customs of her time . while most girls her age are trying to quietly and demurely seek the approval of the local matchmaker ( miriam margoyles ) , mulan would prefer speaking her mind . but there is trouble on the horizon . the evil huns , led by shan-yu ( miguel ferrer ) , are invading china . the emperor ( pat morita ) has decreed that each family must donate one man to serve in the army . the only male in mulan's family is her father , fa zhou ( soon-tek oh ) , who , old and with a bad leg , honorably accepts his fate . mulan , on the other hand , decides to save her father's life . . . by secretly masquerading as a man and taking his place on the battlefield . mulan , under the assumed name of ping , appears at camp where she , along with the other bumbling recruits , yao ( harvey fierstein ) , chien-po ( jerry tondo ) and ling ( gedde watanabe ) , are trained in the art of war by captain shang ( b . d . wong , singing : donny osmond ) . but she's not alone in her tasks . . . in typical disney fashion , she has three animal companions : her horse khan , a lucky cricket crickey , and a pint-sized "" guardian "" dragon called mushu ( eddie murphy ) . much like the gargoyles in the hunchback of notre dame , the humor in mulan is lukewarm and doesn't flow well with the rest of the more serious story . sure , some occasional comic relief is welcome , particularly in a film geared for the younger set , but mulan overdoes it . the overdose of humor turns what could have been a powerfully great film into a good , but schizophrenic experience . but , that commentary aside , this is a very well made film ( which makes the formulaic additions all the more regrettable ) . the animation is on par with some of disney's best . the story itself is interesting , and the action scenes are awe-inspiring . the musical score to the film is enjoyable , though , as has been the case with disney's recent work , the songs are mostly forgettable . at least , we're only subjected to four of them this time around . mulan boasts the highest death toll of any disney cartoon to date . most of the killing is off-screen and it's all highly depersonalized ( there's nothing to compare with the death of mufasa or bambi's mom ) . there's nothing graphic , and the film resides snugly inside a g rating . children will probably have more questions about the restrictive ancient customs than of the slaughter of armies . it's ironic that a film concerned with bucking tradition is hampered because of its strict adherence to disney tradition . if the filmmakers had the guts to lessen the humor , ax the compulsory songs , and remove the obligatory ( and somewhat unrealistic ) romance , they could have had a classic on their hands . instead , they merely deliver a very good time at the movies ."
"if you're the type of person who goes on the submarine ride every time you visit disneyland , you're going to love the hunt for red october . you'll also love the film if you enjoy cat and mouse military tactics , or if you're a sean connery or alec baldwin fan , or if you admired director john mctiernan's earlier films , die hard and predator . in fact , the only people likely to be disappointed with the hunt for red october are those who have read the book , since films almost never live up to the novels which inspired them . the hunt for red october is an epic thriller , adapted from tom clancy's best selling novel . set in an era before glasnost , the movie revolves around a top-secret soviet submarine , called the red october . the nuclear sub has a revolutionary propulsion system , which makes the vessel silent and allows it to escape sonar detection . the red october embarks on its maiden voyage under the command of captain marko ramius , played by sean connery . ramius has strict orders just to test the submarine , but he has other ideas . he takes the sub and its crew and disappears into the atlantic ocean . is he planning to start world war iii ? cia analyst jack ryan doesn't think so ; he's convinced that ramius plans to defect to the u . s . ryan , played by alec baldwin , is given three days to prove his theory and find the missing sub . the characters in the hunt for red october are paper thin , but the performances , thankfully , are rock solid . baldwin and connery anchor the film with their customary vigor . sam neil gives a sturdy performance as connery's somber first officer . it's ironic to see neil and connery playing russians , since they are both best known for their roles as british agents , connery as james bond and neil as reilly , "" ace of spies . "" the large cast also includes scott glenn , james earl jones , tim curry , and joss ackland , plus richard jordan as the smooth u . s . national security adviser . the special effects are remarkable , but more than anything , the hunt for red october is distinguished by its water-tight plot . screenwriters larry ferguson and donald stewart have gracefully navigated red october through a story line full of twists and turns . they keep us involved in the action by unveiling plot strands at just the right moment . the movie doesn't get as sweaty or breathless as die hard , because it would rather tell a good story than hit you over the head with non-stop action . the finale is rousing and suspenseful , but essentially , the hunt for red october is a superior potboiler ."
"it's been a long time since walt disney has delivered us a classic along the lines of the little mermaid or beauty and the beast . sure , there have been delightful outings like last years hercules . but nothing entirely groundbreaking . with the release of the studio's newest feature length film , a remake of edgar rice burrough's creation tarzan , disney has plunged into new waters with both maturity and animation techniques . it's no classic , but this new tarzan represents exactly what a family film should be . the plot is loyal to the original storyline , as tarzan's parents are forced to abandon their ship which has caught fire , and find shelter in the jungles of africa . but , they are killed ( offscreen ) by the snarling cheetah sabor , leaving baby tarzan alone and unharmed in his crib . found by kala ( voiced with effective gentleness by glenn close ) , a kindhearted mother and member of a gorilla pack , tarzan is taken into the primate group and raised as one of their own . we follow the young boy through the years , as he partakes in various adventures with his loud mouth gorilla friend terk ( a very brash but funny rosie o'donnell ) and clumsy elephant tantor ( wayne knight ) . of course , in any disney film we are given some kind of goofy sidekick or humorous chum for the hero . in tarzan , these characters fill that space rather inconspicuously . gags that were magnified in other family films are kept quite minor here . most of the characters are amusing without being forced . as tarzan grows to manhood , the suspected antagonist stumbles into the picture . here , the notorious bad guy is the big game hunter clayton ( brian blessed ) , who's accompanying a hapless professor ( nigel hawthorne ) on an expedition through the jungle . of course , there's the professor's daughter , jane ( nicely vocalized by a cheerful minnie driver ) who will help supply the romantic quotient of the movie . the thing that blew my socks off about this version of tarzan is the stunning animation . directors chris buck and kevin lima have applied a breathtaking 3-d element to the movement of the athletic title character , and the fast-paced editing is absolutely a marvel . as tarzan carries jane through the treetops , narrowly escaping a pack of nasty baboons , he slips and slides like a daredevil snow boarder or star surfer riding the big wave . your eyes can barely keep up ; it's a fantastic accomplishment . the subject matter here is also a notch or two above animation average . there are important questions raised about tarzan's place in the world , and all are handled exceptionally well by the screenwriters . there is no shred of doubt left to ponder afterward , which is a surprising plus that i wasn't expecting to find here . suffice to say , this film will have both adults and children thoroughly entertained . the grown-up tarzan is voiced by tony goldwyn , who made a name for himself as the `big mean jerk' from ghost . goldwyn is effective playing someone who's not aware of his world's dangers . glenn close is also memorable as his gorilla mother , and lance henriksen ( from tv's millennium ) is terrific as the silverback father unsure of how to accept the presence of a human child . as the movie's villain , there is nothing particularly special or catching about the character of clayton . it helps that brian blessed supplies his voice with game enthusiasm , but he is nothing compared to james woods' hilarious hades from hercules . a burley guy with a big gun who just wants to capture the gorillas does not quite constitute for an all-together noticeable screen presence . still , this is one great thrill-ride that disney has constructed . i never expected rice burrough's work to be transformed so successfully from live action to animation , nor with so much emotional depth . parents , along with all the kiddies , are going to find much to like in tarzan ."
"i'll be the first to admit i didn't expect much from the emperor's new groove : more celine dion-esque song-and-dance numbers , cuddly characters that become cross-promotion devices in mcdonald's happy meals , and hollywood stars trying to gain credibility by adding a voice-over job to their resume . i was dead wrong about all of those things . the emperor's new groove is funny . damn funny . and the cute characters in the film are the dangerous ones . the script is fast and furious , with no singing and dancing . the animation is clean and would give walt a warm feeling all over . the humor is dry and aimed at both the cynicism and the goodness in all of us . the story is ridiculously weird and comes off as a strange acid trip involving talking , cross-dressing llamas and schizophrenia . here's the plot ; try to follow along . set in a mythical kingdom , the film follows the adventures of kuzco ( david spade ) , an arrogant and egocentric emperor . when kuzco fires his power-hungry advisor , yzma ( eartha kitt ) , she and her "" assistant "" kronk ( seinfeld's patrick warburton ) change him into a llama . kuzco then gets stranded in the jungle and must rely on pacha ( john goodman ) , a llama-herder whose home was to be replaced by kuzco's water world theme park , to save him . then the fun starts . for the next sixty minutes , the audience is treated to something unheard of in disney films these days : imagination . yzma , voiced by the talented singer eartha kitt , looks like a cross between norma desmond , joan crawford , and a really old vegas showgirl . the dialogue between her and her oblivious assistant kronk is quick , sharp , and feels like an episode of seinfeld ( which would make sense ) . david spade and john goodman's character interactions make you feel like you're watching an old hope/crosby film . spade is beyond dry with his humor and shoots below the belt on several occasions , and i laughed out loud several times . needless to say , that is an extremely rare thing in disney screenings these days . the best part about the emperor's new groove is how audacious the film is . the sheer weirdness factor is very high . cross-dressing , schizophrenia , duality of soul , people being turned into every animal on noah's boat , llama cpr , homoerotic tendencies , an emperor with his own theme song and singer , michael jackson dance moves , and a guy that can communicate with a squirrel are only a few of the oddities that make the film a true orginal . simply put , the emperor's new groove is one of the best children's films out for this holiday season . kids will enjoy the adventures , and parents will enjoy the story and dialogue . that's a tough thing to pull off in a single package , but this emperor manages to do it ."
"after the simple looking little spacecraft lands in a automobile wrecking yard , out steps a steel-gray , human-like creature with aquamarine eyes and clad in a muscular suit . spencer , the boy who observes this , having seen his fill of science fiction flicks , figures this thing must be a robot from outer space . with the exception of disney and a few others , most studios view children's films as a way to ship a cheap and unimaginative product and thereby make a quick profit . star kid stands out as that rare kids' film that is undoubtedly low-budget but is also highly imaginative . remember , the robot ? it wasn't one at all but rather a "" phase one assault cyborsuit . "" the cyborsuit is actually a prototype combat enhancer developed by the trelkins and jettisoned for latter retrieval when they are under attack from the invading broodwarriors . the significant twist in the story is that spencer gets to go inside the cyborsuit , and the cyborsuit , nicknamed cy , has plenty of spunk . cy keeps questioning the kid about everything including words like "" cool . "" upon hearing that "" command , "" cy starts rapidly decreasing the temperature in the cyborsuit until spencer screams for him to stop . and when cy speaks , we see spencer's view , the backside of cy's lips and eyes . as 12-year-old spencer , joseph mazzello from the jurassic park film series gives a remarkably good performance as a wimpy and initially tongue-tied kid . even when enclosed in his powerful new cyborsuit , he has his fears but he learns to overcome them . "" if you run away , things don't get better , whether it's bullies , spiders , or girls , "" his science teacher advises him after he has difficulties dealing with all three . turbo ( joey simmrin ) , the school's chubby bully , beats up on him , spiders frighten him , and , most embarrassing of all , he can't speak when in the presence of his would-be girlfriend . with his cyborsuit on , he learns some bravery that transcends his time inside cy . spencer lives with his dad and his older teenage sister stacey , played by a smart-mouthed ashlee levitch , who looks like a younger sarah jessica parker . stacey derides her brother , whom she barely tolerates , by referring to him only as "" the fungus . "" this whole setup for spencer's downtrodden and delightfully funny life makes his acquisition of some superhuman powers a source of mirth and empowerment . the beauty of mazzello's performance is that you can vicariously experience his fear and share in his enjoyment when he goes after the bully to teach him a lesson he'll not soon forget . the ensuing mayhem has some of the home alone antics , but the slapstick is kept tightly under control by writer and director manny coto so that one never feels embarrassed to be laughing . the romantic angle is handled ever so delicately . when cy wishes to know if spencer wants to mate with the object of his desire , michelle ( lauren eckstrom ) , his eyes open wide in revulsion . "" mate with her ! "" spencer exclaims . "" pllllleeeeease , i just like her that's all . "" the show has many funny twists . in one , cy sees a man in a barney-like costume and begins firing at him , thinking he is an alien life-form . soon things get way out of hand , and cy and spencer have to beat a hasty retreat . as proof positive of the show's class , it actually contains tasteful bathroom humor -- thought that was an oxymoron in a kids' picture , didn't you ? cy cannot allow spencer to leave the cyborsuit , and what happens when he needs to urinate becomes both sweet and hilarious . the director's staging of this sequence is one of the film's more charming moments . oh , and eating is pretty funny too . spencer , whose idol is the comic book character "" midknight warrior , "" gets to face the challenge of a lifetime when a broodwarrior comes to capture the cyborsuit . spencer's valiant battle gives him a chance to find his mettle . and the action sequences in the battle manage to be quite respectable for a kids' show full of inventiveness and lacking the usual repetition . for a family movie mixing humor , fantasy , and action , star kid delivers . although it's probably not the sort of movie you'd want to see without kids , with them you'll have a magical time with a relatively straightforward but well developed story . you'll be rooting for and laughing with spencer and his buddy cy all the way through . star kid runs 1 : 41 . it is rated pg for fantasy combat . although the basically cartoonish broodwarrior might scare the littlest kids , i saw none of this in evidence in our packed screening , so i would say the show is fine for kids five and up , and possibly the younger ones . my son jeffrey , age 8 , got really excited about the picture . he called it "" an especially good movie "" and gave it * * * * . when i asked him to tell me his favorite characters , he mentioned almost everyone in it from the boy to the cyborsuit to the bully ."
"there's good news and bad news about mulan . the positive is that disney has found a happy medium between the heavy-handedness of pocahontas and the hunchback of notre dame and the childishness of hercules . on the other hand , the studio is pulling out all the stops on plot cliches and cheap laughs , several steps down from the days of the little mermaid and beauty and the beast . but mulan is a step in the right direction and disney's best animated feature since the lion king . after giving native americans a turn in pocahontas , disney has decided to turn a movie over to the asians . mulan is set in feudal china and features the ever-popular heroine who marches to a different drum and wants to do more with her life than get married . that's what we find out when young mulan ( voice of ming- na wen ) screws up her appointment with the matchmaker by letting a rogue cricket splash coffee all over her . cartoons . . . meanwhile , word comes from the emporer that one man from every family must join the army and help fight the huns . since mulan's a girl , that means her decrepit old father must go . she pleads with the soldiers to have mercy on dear old dad , but that kind of groveling and desperation brings shame on her family . that's chinese culture for you . . . so imagine how embarrassed the family is the next day when they find mulan has stolen her father's uniform and sword and run off to join the army in his place . the movie in a nutshell is about the stuggles of being a woman in the army . it should have been called g . i . chang . mulan calls on her ancestors for help . they decide to summon the large stone dragon in the backyard to protect her , but a mini dragon named mushu screws it up . voiced by eddie murphy , mushu continues the tradition of cute talking animal sidekicks who do more slapstick harm than good for their human charges . murphy's performance is a direct descendent of robin williams in aladdin -- lots of wisecracks and ad-libs and even an introductory song about how much fun they're going to have . you ain't never had a friend like mushu . speaking of songs , mulan doesn't have too many of them , which is a plus with a story like this . disney songs about war probably wouldn't go over too well ( "" heigh ho , heigh ho , it's off to war i go . . . "" ) , and the ones they do have aren't memorable . the best of the bunch , sad to say , is "" be a man , "" the requisite basic training montage song . yes , even in medieval china , they had to run through that web of car tires before they were ready for battle . sung by donnie osmond ( a bad sign if ever there was one ) , "" be a man "" accompanies footage of mulan's platoon going from screw-ups to heroes . it makes me wonder , has there ever been a musical montage in a movie that's ended badly ? i only wish real-life problems could be solved in two minutes with a peppy montage . for the curious , mulan does pass for a man in the army despite looking like a girl . all she does to transform herself is cut her hair to a sexy shoulder-length , talk macho and slap guys on the butt , as was male custom a thousand years ago in china . the deception fools everyone but the audience , who thinks she might be able to pass for a 12-year-old boy , at best . but she does manage to strike the biggest blows to the hun army , led by a big , evil-eyed attilla-looking monster . as a villain , the head of the huns is menacing , evil and entirely forgettable . i saw the movie yesterday and i don't remember the man's name . otherwise , mulan is a good movie . the animation of the characters themselves isn't as rich as it could and should be , but there are some amazing battlefield shots . eddie murphy pulls off some good one-liners , as do other star voices like harvey fierstein and pat morita , the quintessential asian movie star . hell , george "" mr . sulu "" takei does a voice in mulan . you get the sense disney said to themselves , "" alright , let's get out there and find us some chinese americans in hollywood . who can you think of ? "" "" well , there's mr . myagi . . . "" "" good . "" "" and mr . sulu . "" "" perfect . we've got ourselves a movie now . "" soon disney really _will_ be able to paint with all the colors of the wind ."
"it stands as a moment one will not soon forget : a giant , green ogre flips through the pages of a cliche fairy tale , narrating it with every bit of dull inspiration that the story holds . this leads one to believe that this serves as the prologue to shrek , dreamworks' second computer animated feature , but in a pricelessly hilarious bit of cinema , a page of this tale serves as that ogre's toilet paper . from this opening moment , one can infer shrek's defying of all expectations regarding it as a standard , disney-esque fairy tale . although rampant moments of hilarity dot shrek , the true charm of the film lies in the bold elements of friendship , courage , and acceptance , excelled by outstanding direction , stunning actor voice work , and most importantly , a witty screenplay with more going on than meets the eye . while shrek features an abundance of humor related directly toward adults , positive friendship values aimed at younger children fulfill the storyline : shrek , the previously mentioned ogre , holds a position of absolute nothingness within his community . the jolly green giant meets a fellow outsider , known only as the donkey ( his species ) who talks , and although he remains reluctant to warm up to him for a good portion of time , shrek eventually comes to a mutual understanding with him by acknowledging their common state as outcasts of the world . the pair team up to retrieve princess fiona from a castle guarded by a dragon for the powerful lord farquaad , learning quite a bit about each other and themselves along the way . their friendship exhibits the core theme of the need for someone to lean on , exemplifying to any child who may witness the film that acting as an honest companion can unquestionably affect someone . shrek and donkey endure as supposed freaks of nature due only to their differences from others but cling to each other for support and guidance along their journey . courage demonstrates itself within two major storylines : along the journey to rescue fiona , donkey's immeasurable cowardice reveals itself . whether he encounters walking over a shaky bridge or living alone , donkey withholds fears that he continuously puts aside without self-acknowledgment . but the yapping donkey must face his phobias when presented with the giant , fire-breathing dragon guarding fiona ; either he dies from terror or he triumphs with courage . he wisely chooses courage by pretending as if no dangerous situation actually faces him , allowing the donkey to overcome a horror that likely only continued due to his insistence of them . secondly , upon shrek's and donkey's redeeming of princess fiona , the ogre finds the princess has plans for whomever saves her : to satisfy her desire for a ( human ) knight in shining armor . throughout this storyline , shrek faces his deep , perpetual misgivings of inhering as an ogre and struggles to determine how he will reveal his true identity to fiona . an ongoing struggle occurs between himself and his reluctance of the truth , but eventually , shrek courageously conquers his fear by telling the forbidden secret to fiona . children can realize from donkey and shrek that fear remains only as complicated as one makes it ; if one sets his/her mind to overcoming something in particular , endless possibilities exist . after the friendships and courage prevail , the three central characters at the heart of shrek must take one more stretch of development : acceptance . surprisingly , fiona holds a dark secret of her own : due to a spell cast upon her years ago , she transforms into an ogre by night . in this storyline , fiona must learn to hold acceptance for herself , and she must realize what beauty truly means : to simply act as one's self . upon fiona's learning of shrek's desire to pursue a relationship with her , fiona , knowing that acceptance of herself serves as the only platform for her love with shrek to work , gives in to her inner demons of self-ridicule and hatred . any child can pull from fiona's transformation the meaning of beauty and the meaning of self-acceptance . on the technical side , shrek triumphs . directors adam adamson and vicky jenson pace shrek in a consistent and satisfying manner , evenly distributing the lessons learned by the central characters . these central characters spring to life thanks to brilliant voice work from mike myers ( shrek ) , eddie murphy ( donkey ) , and cameron diaz ( princess fiona ) . myers creates his shrek as a lovable and troubled ogre whose green color not only serves as a skin color but perhaps his envy of other , "" normal "" beings . murphy succeeds with his donkey through recreating the high-strung persona that so many know the actor to have off screen . cameron diaz exudes charisma and innocence as fiona , giving the princess/ogre a sense of power that many female characters in animated films lack . while the direction and voice work certainly elevate shrek , the ultimate factor in the film succeeding lies in the screenplay , written by ted elliott , terry rossio , joe stillman , and roger s . h . schulman . the script never underestimates the intelligence of the viewer , combining the three previously spoken of elements with humor for adults and children alike . capping it off with a constant tongue-in-cheek feel that pokes fun at classic disney animated features , the fresh and entertaining screenplay delivers . with shrek , dreamworks executive jeffrey katzenberg has certainly one-upped himself by creating an instant animated classic that will live on for ages to come . the smaller children will laugh and cheer ; the adults will laugh even harder and leave understanding much that their children did not . a film that breaks stereotypes and creates a definite standard of its own , shrek can certainly endure as one for the ages ."
"the happy bastard's quick movie review me tarzan . . . you happy viewer . for a minute there , i thought i was going to be groaning over the release of disney's latest , another adaptation of a legend from the past . ( remember the pathetic pocahontas ? yikes ! ) but guess what- disney , a company that's been on a roll lately with animated films , strikes again with another wonderful tale that pleases the eyes as well as the inner kid in you . the story is pretty basic- tarzan is left orphaned and a female gorilla who's lost her young adopts him into her group . as he matures into a much older man , tarzan still wonders just why he's so much different from the clan , and then arrives a hunter , a professor , and the professor's lovely daughter , jane- who meets tarzan rather quickly after getting in trouble with a group of feisty babboons . from there , tarzan faces tough choices- should he stay with the ones that he grew up with or go join his own kind in england ? the voicework here is pretty top-level . tony goldwyn is very convincing as the ape man ; minnie driver adds a delectable touch to the already-beautiful jane ; nigel hawthorne makes for a pretty nasty hunter voice ; rosie o' donnell keeps the laughs rolling as tarzan's best ape friend terk ; and wayne "" newman "" knight has his moments as a panicky elephant . the movie is superb throughout , mixing a great script with incredible computer-assisted visuals . when tarzan tree-surfs ( a twist that was added on top of the same ol' vine swinging- and a great one , i might add ) , the camera twists and turns , allowing the trees all around to come to life vividly . i couldn't believe my eyes- disney has come a long way since starting in a ballroom for beauty and the beast . and the music's not half bad , either . fortunately , there's no ridiculous singing characters here , just a great set of songs by phil collins that perfectly fit the mood . there's some great action sequences here as well , including a wonderfully done chase between tarzan , jane , and the aforementioned babboons . but , of course , it's not all action- there's a message here as well that has to do with family . this is easily one of disney's best animated films of the decade and it's one i can't wait to put in my home library . . . that is , if my vcr still works in the year 2000 ."
""" remember what the mpaa says : horrific and deplorable violence is ok as long as you don't say any naughty words . "" featuring the voice talents of matt stone , trey parker , mary kay bergman . rated r . filmmakers jump on real-life controversies faster than austin powers on felicity shagwell . the debate on whether cinema is to blame for teenagers turning into hoodlums has only begun to heat up , and already someone's made a movie about it , and it's not , thank god , a tragic account of a family ripped apart by the effect violence in films had on a teenage boy . instead we get a sharp , biting satire that takes no prisoners and leaves no conservative point of view unscathed . based on a popular ( and controversial ) cable tv show , south park : bigger longer and uncut can finally break loose of the shackles placed on the show by television restrictions and take bad taste to brand new heights . the movie is about a group of kids who sneak into a canadian r-rated movie and learn some naughty words . when they exhibit their new knowledge to their moms , they decide to "" blame canada , "" wage war against the neighbor country and execute "" terrence and phillip , "" the flatulent actors in the obscene film . the kids form an alliance they name "" la resistance "" ( with the accent on the third syllable of "" resistance "" ) to save their favorite thespians , in a hilarious spoof of ( tribute to ? ) les mis ? rables . in a subplot , one of the characters ( kenny , who else ? ) dies and goes to hell where he meets satan . satan and saddam hussein are lovers , you see . satan is a benevolent soul , while our favorite eastern ruler can only think about sex . apparently , too , if terrence and phillip are executed it will be the final sign of the apocalypse and satan can emerge from the deepest bowels of the underground kingdom to rule the earth . aside from being a brilliant satire , south park is also an all-stops-out musical , with unforgettable numbers like "" shut your f * * * ing face uncle f * * * er "" and "" cartman's mom is a big fat bitch "" . almost invariably it's funny stuff : often juvenile but always funny . the same can be said for the rest of the movie : it's intelligent but delivered in a sophomoric manner ( i . e . toilet humor , endless profanity , etc . ) . not that there's anything wrong with that : vulgarity , when done right , is my bag , baby . trey parker and matt stone , the twenty-somethings behind the film and the show , paint a bulls-eye on the motion picture association of america and proceed to be the first to start trying to hit it . cruelly mocking the fact that the mpaa's rating system will allegedly tolerate grotesque violence as long as obscenities aren't uttered , the auteurs throw some nasty one-liner insults their way . the ratings-a-plenty association isn't the only target of this unsparing banter : people who favor censoring movies over gun control are equally fair game , with the "" blame canada "" plot being a not-so-cheap shot at them . the distinctively low-tech "" cardboard "" animation is oddly effective , even more so than the state of the art "" deep canvas "" technique aptly demonstrated in the recent tarzan . it's more pleasant to look at , less intimidating up on the screen , and most importantly it doesn't detract from the film's concept as much as disney's admirably awe-inspiring work does . the show's popularity has been waning as of late , and perhaps this movie is just the thing to boost its ratings . perhaps not . having seen the show on numerous occasions , i can say that it's not nearly as smart or as funny as this movie . the series may be better off simply continuing on the big screen every couple years . parker and stone have outdone themselves to the point where i am forced to ask : must the show go on ? ? 1999 eugene novikov&#137 ;"
